# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We plan to meet twice a week on Zoom (in person if necessary). The meeting time is Tuesday and Thursday around 3 (also on weekends if the weekly task is more difficult than expected). Each meeting will be about one to two hours. Notes will be on the shared google doc, and everyone will contribute.

2. **Assistance** 
We use WeChat or Discord to communicate, and all discussions will be in group chat. Whoever needs help may put their questions through the group chat, and anyone needed by others is expected to give a response within 2 hours normally.

3. **Respect** 
We welcome and value everyone’s ideas and suggestions. Any idea and suggestion or any change regards to the project are subject to full agreement. Any rejection will be given reasons by all members. Thus each team member will actively engage, contribute, be valued, and be respected.


## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Tasks are distributed according to each team member’s ability: strengths and weaknesses, knowledge, etc. The overall workload should be the same upon full agreement. Unexpected complications or unforeseen work should be proposed in group chat, and reallocation of tasks is expected.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Everyone should contribute 6-10 hours to the group project. Anyone who has a time conflict should notify other group members, and the group task will be rescheduled. The member who has a conflict could make up for the lack of work next week accordingly.


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will discuss any conflict in the group chat and if the conflict affects the progress of the project and cannot be addressed properly through chat communication, we will arrange an extra meeting to address the issue until a full agreement is reached. The member who has not accomplished the tasks should make up for the lack of work later: if the member does not have the full ability to overcome the complication, tasks of the same workload will be reallocated. Regular late and not completing assigned tasks without notifying the group will result in an alert. Points reduction on peer evaluation and report to course staff will be performed, while this is the last step when the warning is invalid.
