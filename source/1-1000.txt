We review applications of machine learning techniques for the analysis of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector data. Examples include techniques for improving the sensitivity of Advanced Laser Interferometer GW Observatory and Advanced Virgo GW searches, methods for fast measurements of the astrophysical parameters of GW sources, and algorithms for reduction and characterization of non-astrophysical detector noise. These applications demonstrate how machine learning techniques may be harnessed to enhance the science that is possible with current and future GW detectors.

Machine learning describes the capacity of systems to learn from problem-specific training data to automate the process of analytical model building and solve associated tasks. Deep learning is a machine learning concept based on artificial neural networks. For many applications, deep learning models outperform shallow machine learning models and traditional data analysis approaches. In this article, we summarize the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning to generate a broader understanding of the methodical underpinning of current intelligent systems. In particular, we provide a conceptual distinction between relevant terms and concepts, explain the process of automated analytical model building through machine learning and deep learning, and discuss the challenges that arise when implementing such intelligent systems in the field of electronic markets and networked business. These naturally go beyond technological aspects and highlight issues in human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence servitization.

An exciting and relatively recent development is the uptake of machine learning in the natural sciences, where the major goal is to obtain novel scientific insights and discoveries from observational or simulated data. A prerequisite for obtaining a scientific outcome is domain knowledge, which is needed to gain explainability, but also to enhance scientific consistency. In this article, we review explainable machine learning in view of applications in the natural sciences and discuss three core elements that we identified as relevant in this context: transparency, interpretability, and explainability. With respect to these core elements, we provide a survey of recent scientific works that incorporate machine learning and the way that explainable machine learning is used in combination with domain knowledge from the application areas.

This is a promising way to release the contribution from human labor and automatically recognize the health states of machines, thus it has attracted much attention in the last two or three decades. Although IFD has achieved a considerable number of successes, a review still leaves a blank space to systematically cover the development of IFD from the cradle to the bloom, and rarely provides potential guidelines for the future development. To bridge the gap, this article presents a review and roadmap to systematically cover the development of IFD following the progress of machine learning theories and offer a future perspective. In the past, traditional machine learning theories began to weak the contribution of human labor and brought the era of artificial intelligence to machine fault diagnosis. Over the recent years, the advent of deep learning theories has reformed IFD in further releasing the artificial assistance since the 2010s, which encourages to construct an end-to-end diagnosis procedure. It means to directly bridge the relationship between the increasingly-grown monitoring data and the health states of machines. In the future, transfer learning theories attempt to use the diagnosis knowledge from one or multiple diagnosis tasks to other related ones, which prospectively overcomes the obstacles in applications of IFD to engineering scenarios. Finally, the roadmap of IFD is pictured to show potential research trends when combined with the challenges in this field. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As geosciences enters the era of big data, machine learning (ML)-that has been widely successful in commercial domains-offers immense potential to contribute to problems in geosciences. However, geoscience applications introduce novel challenges for ML due to combinations of geoscience properties encountered in every problem, requiring novel research in machine learning. This article introduces researchers in the machine learning (ML) community to these challenges offered by geoscience problems and the opportunities that exist for advancing both machine learning and geosciences. We first highlight typical sources of geoscience data and describe their common properties. We then describe some of the common categories of geoscience problems where machine learning can play a role, discussing the challenges faced by existing ML methods and opportunities for novel ML research. We conclude by discussing some of the cross-cutting research themes in machine learning that are applicable across several geoscience problems, and the importance of a deep collaboration between machine learning and geosciences for synergistic advancements in both disciplines.

Active learning machine learns to create new quantum experiments	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						machine learning; quantum experiments; quantum entanglement; artificial intelligence; quantum machine learning	ORBITAL ANGULAR-MOMENTUM; ENTANGLEMENT	How useful can machine learning be in a quantum laboratory? Here we raise the question of the potential of intelligent machines in the context of scientific research. A major motivation for the present work is the unknown reachability of various entanglement classes in quantum experiments. We investigate this question by using the projective simulation model, a physics-oriented approach to artificial intelligence. In our approach, the projective simulation system is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce high-dimensional entangled multiphoton states, which are of high interest in modern quantum experiments. The artificial intelligence system learns to create a variety of entangled states and improves the efficiency of their realization. In the process, the system autonomously (re)discovers experimental techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical experiments-a trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but emerged through the process of learning. Such features highlight the possibility that machines could have a significantly more creative role in future research.

J	Probst, P; Boulesteix, AL; Bischl, B				Probst, Philipp; Boulesteix, Anne-Laure; Bischl, Bernd			Tunability: Importance of Hyperparameters of Machine Learning Algorithms	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						machine learning; supervised learning; classification; hyperparameters; tuning; meta-learning		Modern supervised machine learning algorithms involve hyperparameters that have to be set before running them. Options for setting hyperparameters are default values from the software package, manual configuration by the user or configuring them for optimal predictive performance by a tuning procedure. The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we formalize the problem of tuning from a statistical point of view, define data-based defaults and suggest general measures quantifying the tunability of hyperparameters of algorithms. Secondly, we conduct a large-scale benchmarking study based on 38 datasets from the OpenML platform and six common machine learning algorithms. We apply our measures to assess the tunability of their parameters. Our results yield default values for hyperparameters and enable users to decide whether it is worth conducting a possibly time consuming tuning strategy, to focus on the most important hyperparameters and to choose adequate hyperparameter spaces for tuning.

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.

Amid a growing focus on "Big Data," it offers epidemiologists new tools to tackle problems for which classical methods are not well-suited. In order to critically evaluate the value of integrating machine learning algorithms and existing methods, however, it is essential to address language and technical barriers between the two fields that can make it difficult for epidemiologists to read and assess machine learning studies. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts and terminology used in machine learning literature, which encompasses a diverse set of tools with goals ranging from prediction to classification to clustering. We provide a brief introduction to 5 common machine learning algorithms and 4 ensemble-based approaches. We then summarize epidemiologic applications of machine learning techniques in the published literature. We recommend approaches to incorporate machine learning in epidemiologic research and discuss opportunities and challenges for integrating machine learning and existing epidemiologic research methods.

This paper proposes a novel machine-learning and deep-learning method to identify natural-terrain landslides using integrated geodatabases. First, landslide-related data are compiled, including topographic data, geological data and rainfall-related data. Then, three integrated geodatabases are established; namely, Recent Landslide Database (RecLD), Relict Landslide Database (RelLD) and Joint Landslide Database (JLD). After that, five machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosting methods and convolutional neural network (CNN), are utilized and evaluated on each database. A case study in Lantau, Hong Kong, is conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. From the results of the case study, CNN achieves an identification accuracy of 92.5% on RecLD, and outperforms other algorithms due to its strengths in feature extraction and multi dimensional data processing. Boosting methods come second in terms of accuracy, followed by RF, LR and SVM. By using machine learning and deep learning techniques, the proposed landslide identification method shows outstanding robustness and great potential in tackling the landslide identification problem.

Comparing with a range of classical probabilistic data fusion techniques, machine learning method that automatically learns from past experiences without explicitly programming, remarkably renovates fusion techniques by offering the strong ability of computing and predicting. Nevertheless, the literature still lacks a thorough review of the recent advances of machine learning for data fusion. Therefore, it is beneficial to review and summarize the state of the art in order to gain a deep insight on how machine learning can benefit and optimize data fusion. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data fusion methods based on machine learning. We first offer a detailed introduction to the background of data fusion and machine learning in terms of definitions, applications, architectures, processes, and typical techniques. Then, we propose a number of requirements and employ them as criteria to review and evaluate the performance of existing fusion methods based on machine learning. Through the literature review, analysis and comparison, we finally come up with a number of open issues and propose future research directions in this field.

Machine learning is driven by data. It learns from a part of the input data and builds a model. The model is used to predict and analyze another part of the data to get the results people want. With the continuous advancement of ocean observation technology, the amount of ocean data and data dimensions are rising sharply. The use of traditional data analysis methods to analyze massive amounts of data has revealed many shortcomings. The development of machine learning has solved these shortcomings. Nowadays, the use of machine learning technology to analyze and apply ocean data becomes the focus of scientific research. This method has important practical and long-term significance for protecting the ocean environment, predicting ocean elements, exploring the unknown, and responding to extreme weather. This paper focuses on the analysis of the state of the art and specific practices of machine learning in ocean data, review the application examples of machine learning in various fields such as ocean sound source identification and positioning, ocean element prediction, ocean biodiversity monitoring, and deep-sea resource monitoring. We also point out some constraints that still exist in the research and put forward the future development direction and application prospects.

Methods In this study, extensive research efforts were made to identify those studies that applied more than one supervised machine learning algorithm on single disease prediction. Two databases (i.e., Scopus and PubMed) were searched for different types of search items. Thus, we selected 48 articles in total for the comparison among variants supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. Results We found that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied most frequently (in 29 studies) followed by the Naive Bayes algorithm (in 23 studies). However, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed superior accuracy comparatively. Of the 17 studies where it was applied, RF showed the highest accuracy in 9 of them, i.e., 53%. This was followed by SVM which topped in 41% of the studies it was considered. Conclusion This study provides a wide overview of the relative performance of different variants of supervised machine learning algorithms for disease prediction. This important information of relative performance can be used to aid researchers in the selection of an appropriate supervised machine learning algorithm for their studies.

J	Liu, HY; Lang, B				Liu, Hongyu; Lang, Bo			Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods for Intrusion Detection Systems: A Survey	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Review						machine learning; deep learning; intrusion detection system; cyber security	NETWORK; ATTACKS	Networks play important roles in modern life, and cyber security has become a vital research area. An intrusion detection system (IDS) which is an important cyber security technique, monitors the state of software and hardware running in the network. Despite decades of development, existing IDSs still face challenges in improving the detection accuracy, reducing the false alarm rate and detecting unknown attacks. To solve the above problems, many researchers have focused on developing IDSs that capitalize on machine learning methods. Machine learning methods can automatically discover the essential differences between normal data and abnormal data with high accuracy. In addition, machine learning methods have strong generalizability, so they are also able to detect unknown attacks. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, whose performance is remarkable and has become a research hotspot. This survey proposes a taxonomy of IDS that takes data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarize machine learning-based and deep learning-based IDS literature. We believe that this type of taxonomy framework is fit for cyber security researchers. The survey first clarifies the concept and taxonomy of IDSs. Then, the machine learning algorithms frequently used in IDSs, metrics, and benchmark datasets are introduced. Next, combined with the representative literature, we take the proposed taxonomic system as a baseline and explain how to solve key IDS issues with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Finally, challenges and future developments are discussed by reviewing recent representative studies.

However, most sophisticated machine learning approaches suffer from huge time costs when operating on large-scale data. This issue calls for the need of Large-scale Machine Learning (LML), which aims to learn patterns from big data with comparable performance efficiently. In this paper, we offer a systematic survey on existing LML methods to provide a blueprint for the future developments of this area. We first divide these LML methods according to the ways of improving the scalability: 1) model simplification on computational complexities, 2) optimization approximation on computational efficiency, and 3) computation parallelism on computational capabilities. Then we categorize the methods in each perspective according to their targeted scenarios and introduce representative methods in line with intrinsic strategies. Lastly, we analyze their limitations and discuss potential directions as well as open issues that are promising to address in the future.

In recent years, scientific communities have been gradually merging data-driven approaches with research, enabling dramatic progress in revealing underlying mechanisms, predicting essential properties, and discovering unconventional phenomena. It is becoming an indispensable tool in the fields of, for instance, quantum physics, organic chemistry, and medical imaging. Very recently, machine learning has been adopted in the research of photonics and optics as an alternative approach to address the inverse design problem. In this report, the fast advances of machine-learning-enabled photonic design strategies in the past few years are summarized. In particular, deep learning methods, a subset of machine learning algorithms, dealing with intractable high degrees-of-freedom structure design are focused upon.

J	Stilgoe, J				Stilgoe, Jack			Machine learning, social learning and the governance of self-driving cars	SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE			English	Review						autonomous vehicles; machine learning; responsible innovation; self-driving cars; social learning	TECHNOLOGY; POLICY; PARTICIPATION; EVOLUTION; SCIENCE	Self-driving cars, a quintessentially smart' technology, are not born smart. The algorithms that control their movements are learning as the technology emerges. Self-driving cars represent a high-stakes test of the powers of machine learning, as well as a test case for social learning in technology governance. Society is learning about the technology while the technology learns about society. Understanding and governing the politics of this technology means asking Who is learning, what are they learning and how are they learning?' Focusing on the successes and failures of social learning around the much-publicized crash of a Tesla Model S in 2016, I argue that trajectories and rhetorics of machine learning in transport pose a substantial governance challenge. Self-driving' or autonomous' cars are misnamed. As with other technologies, they are shaped by assumptions about social needs, solvable problems, and economic opportunities. Governing these technologies in the public interest means improving social learning by constructively engaging with the contingencies of machine learning.

Machine vision would ensure the increase of crop production by using an automated, non-destructive and cost-effective technique. In last few years, remarkable results have been achieved in different sectors of agriculture. These achievements are integrated with machine learning techniques on machine vision approach that cope with colour, shape, texture and spectral analysis from the image of objects. Despite having many applications of different machine learning techniques, this review only described the statistical machine learning technologies with machine vision systems in agriculture due to broad area of machine learning applications. Two types of statistical machine learning techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning have been utilized for agriculture. This paper comprehensively surveyed current application of statistical machine learning techniques in machine vision systems, analyses each technique potential for specific application and represents an overview of instructive examples in different agricultural areas. Suggestions of specific statistical machine learning technique for specific purpose and limitations of each technique are also given. Future trends of statistical machine learning technology applications are discussed.

Optimization, as an important part of machine learning, has attracted much attention of researchers. With the exponential growth of data amount and the increase of model complexity, optimization methods in machine learning face more and more challenges. A lot of work on solving optimization problems or improving optimization methods in machine learning has been proposed successively. The systematic retrospect and summary of the optimization methods from the perspective of machine learning are of great significance, which can offer guidance for both developments of optimization and machine learning research. In this article, we first describe the optimization problems in machine learning. Then, we introduce the principles and progresses of commonly used optimization methods. Finally, we explore and give some challenges and open problems for the optimization in machine learning.

SVM is a very powerful classification model in machine learning. CNN is a type of feedforward neural network that includes convolution calculation and has a deep structure. It is one of the representative algorithms of deep learning. Taking SVM and CNN as examples, this paper compares and analyzes the traditional machine learning and deep learning image classification algorithms. This study found that when using a large sample mnist dataset, the accuracy of SVM is 0.88 and the accuracy of CNN is 0.98; when using a small sample COREL1000 dataset, the accuracy of SVM is 0.86 and the accuracy of CNN is 0.83. The experimental results in this paper show that traditional machine learning has a better solution effect on small sample data sets, and deep learning framework has higher recognition accuracy on large sample data sets.

Besides the significant upgrade of the key communication metrics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been envisioned by many researchers as the most important feature of 6G, since the state-of-the-art machine learning technique has been adopted as the top solution in many extremely complex scenarios. Network intelligentization will be the new trend to address the challenges of exponentially increasing number of connected heterogeneous devices. However, compared with the application of machine learning in other fields, such as computer games, current research on intelligent networking still has a long way to go to realize the automatically- configured cellular communication systems. Various problems in terms of communication system, machine learning architectures, and computation efficiency should be addressed for the full use of this technique in 6G. In this paper, we analyze machine learning techniques and introduce 10 most critical challenges in advancing the intelligent 6G system.

A brief overview of the field is given here, allowing the reader to recognize the terminology, the various subfields, and components of machine learning, as well as the clinical potential. Radiomics, an expansion of computer-aided diagnosis, has been defined as the conversion of images to minable data. The ultimate benefit of quantitative radiomics is to (1) yield predictive image-based phenotypes of disease for precision medicine or (2) yield quantitative image-based phenotypes for data mining with other-omics for discovery (ie, imaging genomics). For deep learning in radiology to succeed, note that well-annotated large data sets are needed since deep networks are complex, computer software and hardware are evolving constantly, and subtle differences in disease states are more difficult to perceive than differences in everyday objects. In the future, machine learning in radiology is expected to have a substantial clinical impact with imaging examinations being routinely obtained in clinical practice, providing an opportunity to improve decision support in medical image interpretation. The term of note is decision support, indicating that computers will augment human decision making, making it more effective and efficient. The clinical impact of having computers in the routine clinical practice may allow radiologists to further integrate their knowledge with their clinical colleagues in other medical specialties and allow for precision medicine.

In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Waring, J; Lindvall, C; Umeton, R				Waring, Jonathan; Lindvall, Charlotta; Umeton, Renato			Automated machine learning: Review of the state-of-the-art and opportunities for healthcare	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Review						Machine learning; Deep learning; Automated machine learning; AutoML; Healthcare	BIG DATA; HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; REPRESENTATION; ANALYTICS; SELECTION; PATIENT; SYSTEM; RISK	Objective: This work aims to provide a review of the existing literature in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML) to help healthcare professionals better utilize machine learning models "off-the-shelf" with limited data science expertise. We also identify the potential opportunities and barriers to using AutoML in healthcare, as well as existing applications of AutoML in healthcare. Methods: Published papers, accompanied with code, describing work in the field of AutoML from both a computer science perspective or a biomedical informatics perspective were reviewed. We also provide a short summary of a series of AutoML challenges hosted by ChaLearn. Results: A review of 101 papers in the field of AutoML revealed that these automated techniques can match or improve upon expert human performance in certain machine learning tasks, often in a shorter amount of time. The main limitation of AutoML at this point is the ability to get these systems to work efficiently on a large scale, i.e. beyond small- and medium-size retrospective datasets. Discussion: The utilization of machine learning techniques has the demonstrated potential to improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and advance clinical research. However, most hospitals are not currently deploying machine learning solutions. One reason for this is that health care professionals often lack the machine learning expertise that is necessary to build a successful model, deploy it in production, and integrate it with the clinical workflow. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and to reduce the demand for human experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a growing field that seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning models, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task and/or dataset. Conclusion: While there have already been some use cases of AutoML in the healthcare field, more work needs to be done in order for there to be widespread adoption of AutoML in healthcare.

In the development of the ML models, a total of 11 significant landslide controlling factors were selected. The controlling factors relate to the geomorphology, geology, geo-environment and anthropogenic effects: slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, flow accumulation, flow direction, distance to rivers, water content, saturation, rainfall and distance to roads. It is observed that slope angle was the most significant controlling factor in the ML analyses. The performance of the three ML models was evaluated quantitatively based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that the 'ensemble' GBRT machine learning model yielded the most promising results for the spatial prediction of shallow landslides, with a 95% probability of landslide detection and 87% prediction efficiency.

As a clean and sustainable technology, electrocatalysis has been receiving widespread attention. It is crucial to achieve efficient, stable and cheap electrocatalysts. However, the traditional "trial and error" method is time-consuming, laborious and costly. In recent years, with the signifi-cant increase in computing power, computations have played an important role in electrocatalyst design. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to search for advanced electrocatalysts in the vast chemical space through traditional density functional theory (DFT) computations. Fortunately, the develop-ment of machine learning and interdisciplinary integration will inject new impetus into targeted design of electrocatalysts. Machine learning is able to predict electrochemical performances with an accuracy close to DFT. Here we provide an overview of the application of machine learning in elec-trocatalyst design, including the prediction of structure, thermodynamic properties and kinetic barriers. We also discuss the potential of explicit solvent model combined with machine learning molecular dynamics in this field. Finally, the favorable circumstances and challenges are outlined for the future development of machine learning in electrocatalysis. The studies on electrochemical processes by machine learning will further realize targeted design of high-efficiency electrocata-lysts.

Miles			Towards quantum machine learning with tensor networks	QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						quantum computing; machine learning; tensor networks	DENSITY-MATRIX RENORMALIZATION; PRODUCT STATES	Machine learning is a promising application of quantum computing, but challenges remain for implementation today because near-term devices have a limited number of physical qubits and high error rates. Motivated by the usefulness of tensor networks for machine learning in the classical context, we propose quantum computing approaches to both discriminative and generative learning, with circuits based on tree and matrix product state tensor networks, that could already have benefits with such near-term devices. The result is a unified framework in which classical and quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can also provide qubit-efficient schemes in which, depending on the architecture, the number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform handwriting recognition using a hybrid quantum-classical optimization procedure that could be carried out on quantum hardware today, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model.

One of the most exciting applications of machine learning in psychological science has been the development of assessment tools that can powerfully predict human behavior and personality traits. Thus far, machine learning approaches to personality assessment have focused on the associations between social media and other digital records with established personality measures. The goal of this article is to expand the potential of machine learning approaches to personality assessment by embedding it in a more comprehensive construct validation framework. We review recent applications of machine learning to personality assessment, place machine learning research in the broader context of fundamental principles of construct validation, and provide recommendations for how to use machine learning to advance our understanding of personality.

Fluids are well described by the Navier- Stokes equations, but solving these equations at scale remains daunting, limited by the computational cost of resolving the smallest spatiotemporal features. This leads to unfavorable tradeoffs between accuracy and tractability. Here we use end-to-end deep learning to improve approximations inside computational fluid dynamics for modeling two-dimensional turbulent flows. For both direct numerical simulation of turbulence and large-eddy simulation, our results are as accurate as baseline solvers with 8 to 10x finer resolution in each spatial dimension, resulting in 40- to 80-fold computational speedups. Our method remains stable during long simulations and generalizes to forcing functions and Reynolds numbers outside of the flows where it is trained, in contrast to black-box machine-learning approaches. Our approach exemplifies how scientific computing can leverage machine learning and hardware accelerators to improve simulations without sacrificing accuracy or generalization.

In the area of materials science and computational heterogeneous catalysis, this revolution has led to the development of scientific data repositories, as well as data mining and machine learning tools to investigate the vast materials space. The goal of using these tools is to establish a deeper understanding of the relations between materials properties and activity, selectivity and stability - the important figures of merit in catalysis. Based on these insights, catalyst design principles can be established, which hopefully lead us to discover highly efficient catalysts to solve pressing issues for a sustainable future and the synthesis of highly functional materials, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The inherent complexity of catalytic reactions quests for machine learning methods to efficiently navigate through the high-dimensional hyper-surfaces in structure optimization problems to determine relevant chemical structures and transition states. In this review, we show how cutting edge data infrastructures and machine learning methods are being used to address problems in computational heterogeneous catalysis.

Recently, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been implemented in the SDN-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to protect computer networks and to overcome network security issues. A stream of advanced machine learning approaches - the deep learning technology (DL) commences to emerge in the SDN context. In this survey, we reviewed various recent works on machine learning (ML) methods that leverage SDN to implement NIDS. More specifically, we evaluated the techniques of deep learning in developing SDN-based NIDS. In the meantime, in this survey, we covered tools that can be used to develop NIDS models in SDN environment. This survey is concluded with a discussion of ongoing challenges in implementing NIDS using ML/DL and future works.

James; Singh, Chandan; Kumbier, Karl; Abbasi-Asl, Reza; Yu, Bin			Definitions, methods, and applications in interpretable machine learning	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						interpretability; machine learning; explainability; relevancy	EXPLANATION	Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.

Machine Learning Interpretability: A Survey on Methods and Metrics	ELECTRONICS			English	Review						machine learning; interpretability; explainability; XAI		Machine learning systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. These systems's adoption has been expanding, accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society, meaning that algorithmically informed decisions have greater potential for significant social impact. However, most of these accurate decision support systems remain complex black boxes, meaning their internal logic and inner workings are hidden to the user and even experts cannot fully understand the rationale behind their predictions. Moreover, new regulations and highly regulated domains have made the audit and verifiability of decisions mandatory, increasing the demand for the ability to question, understand, and trust machine learning systems, for which interpretability is indispensable. The research community has recognized this interpretability problem and focused on developing both interpretable models and explanation methods over the past few years. However, the emergence of these methods shows there is no consensus on how to assess the explanation quality. Which are the most suitable metrics to assess the quality of an explanation? The aim of this article is to provide a review of the current state of the research field on machine learning interpretability while focusing on the societal impact and on the developed methods and metrics. Furthermore, a complete literature review is presented in order to identify future directions of work on this field.

Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to the lack of essential data and uncertainty, the epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.

Alongside widespread use in image recognition, language processing, and data mining, machine learning techniques have received increasing attention in medical applications, ranging from automated imaging analysis to disease forecasting. This review examines the parallel progress made in epilepsy, highlighting applications in automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG), video, and kinetic data, automated imaging analysis and pre-surgical planning, prediction of medication response, and prediction of medical and surgical outcomes using a wide variety of data sources. A brief overview of commonly used machine learning approaches, as well as challenges in further application of machine learning techniques in epilepsy, is also presented. With increasing computational capabilities, availability of effective machine learning algorithms, and accumulation of larger datasets, clinicians and researchers will increasingly benefit from familiarity with these techniques and the significant progress already made in their application in epilepsy.

Could Machine Learning Break the Convection Parameterization Deadlock?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						convection; machine learning; clouds	SOIL-MOISTURE RETRIEVAL; DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; TROPICAL CONVECTION; CLOUD SUPERPARAMETERIZATION; SELF-AGGREGATION; MODEL; EXPLICIT; CIRCULATION; ORGANIZATION; SIMULATIONS	Representing unresolved moist convection in coarse-scale climate models remains one of the main bottlenecks of current climate simulations. Many of the biases present with parameterized convection are strongly reduced when convection is explicitly resolved (i.e., in cloud resolving models at high spatial resolution approximately a kilometer or so). We here present a novel approach to convective parameterization based on machine learning, using an aquaplanet with prescribed sea surface temperatures as a proof of concept. A deep neural network is trained with a superparameterized version of a climate model in which convection is resolved by thousands of embedded 2-D cloud resolving models. The machine learning representation of convection, which we call the Cloud Brain (CBRAIN), can skillfully predict many of the convective heating, moistening, and radiative features of superparameterization that are most important to climate simulation, although an unintended side effect is to reduce some of the superparameterization's inherent variance. Since as few as three months' high-frequency global training data prove sufficient to provide this skill, the approach presented here opens up a new possibility for a future class of convection parameterizations in climate models that are built top-down, that is, by learning salient features of convection from unusually explicit simulations. Plain Language Summary The representation of cloud radiative effects and the atmospheric heating and moistening due to moist convection remains a major challenge in current generation climate models, leading to a large spread in climate prediction. Here we show that neural networks trained on a high-resolution model in which moist convection is resolved can be an appealing technique to tackle and better represent moist convection in coarse resolution climate models.

Then we discuss some specific methods from the ML literature that we view as important for empirical researchers in economics. These include supervised learning methods for regression and classification, unsupervised learning methods, and matrix completion methods. Finally, we highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML and econometrics that typically perform better than either off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when applied to particular classes of problems, including causal inference for average treatment effects, optimal policy estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of price changes in consumer choice models.

Machine learning-assisted directed protein evolution with combinatorial libraries	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						protein engineering; machine learning; directed evolution; enzyme; catalysis	FITNESS LANDSCAPE; OPTIMIZATION; SILICON	To reduce experimental effort associated with directed protein evolution and to explore the sequence space encoded by mutating multiple positions simultaneously, we incorporate machine learning into the directed evolution workflow. Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally, but machine-learning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally. We validated this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB1 binding protein, demonstrating that machine learning-guided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches. We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers (i.e., stereodivergence) of a new-to-nature carbene Si-H insertion reaction. The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with 93% and 79% ee (enantiomeric excess).

Machine learning (ML) offers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, ML algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of ML for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental ML methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experiments, and simulations. ML provides a powerful information-processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications.

J	Maxwell, AE; Warner, TA; Fang, F				Maxwell, Aaron E.; Warner, Timothy A.; Fang, Fang			Implementation of machine-learning classification in remote sensing: an applied review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Review						Land-cover classification; image classification; land-cover mapping; machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; OBJECT-BASED CLASSIFICATION; YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER; FEATURE-SELECTION; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES; SATELLITE IMAGERY; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Machine learning offers the potential for effective and efficient classification of remotely sensed imagery. The strengths of machine learning include the capacity to handle data of high dimensionality and to map classes with very complex characteristics. Nevertheless, implementing a machine-learning classification is not straightforward, and the literature provides conflicting advice regarding many key issues. This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs. We illustrate these issues through applying machine-learning classification to two publically available remotely sensed data sets.

J	Portugal, I; Alencar, P; Cowan, D				Portugal, Ivens; Alencar, Paulo; Cowan, Donald			The use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems: A systematic review	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Systematic review of the literature; Recommender systems; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Application domains; Performance metrics	OF-THE-ART; COLLABORATIVE RECOMMENDER; SIMILARITY MEASURES; LINK PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; QUALITY; MODELS; USAGE	Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a recommender system is difficult because of the number of algorithms described in the literature. Researchers and practitioners developing recommender systems are left with little information about the current approaches in algorithm usage. Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. The goals of this study are to (i) identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; (ii) identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; and (iii) assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately. The results of this study identify existing classes of recommender systems, characterize adopted machine learning approaches, discuss the use of big data technologies, identify types of machine learning algorithms and their application domains, and analyzes both main and alternative performance metrics.

Data from various omics sources such as genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be integrated to unravel the intricate working of systems biology using machine learning-based predictive algorithms. Machine learning methods offer novel techniques to integrate and analyse the various omics data enabling the discovery of new biomarkers. These biomarkers have the potential to help in accurate disease prediction, patient stratification and delivery of precision medicine. This review paper explores different integrative machine learning methods which have been used to provide an in-depth understanding of biological systems during normal physiological functioning and in the presence of a disease. It provides insight and recommendations for interdisciplinary professionals who envisage employing machine learning skills in multi-omics studies.

The goal of this review is to provide an accessible understanding of why this approach is important for future practice given its potential to augment decisions associated with the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of people suffering from mental illness using clinical and biological data. To this end, the limitations of current statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide evidence of their potential. In the context of promising initial results, the current limitations of machine learning approaches are addressed, and considerations for future clinical translation are outlined.

However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into "black box" approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.

MML is based on the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to automatically identify patterns and act on medical data to guide clinical decisions. MML poses challenges and raises important questions, including (1) How will regulators evaluate MML-based medical devices to ensure their safety and effectiveness? and (2) What additional MML considerations should be taken into account in the international context? To address these questions, we analyze the current regulatory approaches to MML in the USA and Europe. We then examine international perspectives and broader implications, discussing considerations such as data privacy, exportation, explanation, training set bias, contextual bias, and trade secrecy.

Objective: In order to solve the problem of low precision and low efficiency in predicting thermophilic proteins, a prediction method based on feature fusion and machine learning was proposed in this paper. Methods: For the selected thermophilic data sets, firstly, the thermophilic protein sequence was characterized based on feature fusion by the combination of g-gap dipeptide, entropy density and autocorrelation coefficient. Then, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) was used to reduce the dimension of the expressed protein sequence features in order to reduce the training time and improve efficiency. Finally, the classification model was designed by using the classification algorithm. Results: A variety of classification algorithms was used to train and test on the selected thermophilic dataset. By comparison, the accuracy of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) under the jackknife method was over 92%. The combination of other evaluation indicators also proved that the SVM performance was the best. Conclusion: Because of choosing an effectively feature representation method and a robust classifier, the proposed method is suitable for predicting thermophilic proteins and is superior to most reported methods.

De novo composite design based on machine learning algorithm	EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS			English	Article						Composites; Machine learning; Finite elements; Optimization; Mechanical properties	OPTIMIZATION; MODEL	Composites are widely used to create tunable materials to achieve superior mechanical properties. Brittle materials fail catastrophically in the presence of cracks. Incorporating softer constituents into brittle materials can alleviate stress concentration, leading to tougher and stronger composites. However, searching for the optimal designs of composites is extremely challenging due to the astronomical number of possible material and geometry combinations. Here, we apply machine learning to a composite system and demonstrate its capacity to accurately and efficiently predict mechanical properties including toughness and strength. The method we used incorporates machine learning techniques to generate optimal designs with orders of magnitude better than the mean properties of the input training data, and at a much lower computational cost compared to exhaustive methods. Additionally, the method can further rebuild the detailed performances of the designs, even when this information is lost in the training process. The results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to search for optimal designs with very limited training data. To demonstrate the application of machine learning to composite design, we optimize a large-scale system not tractable by an exhaustive brute force approach and show that it is a promising tool towards composite design. This work offers a new perspective in the exploration of design spaces and accelerating the discovery of new functional, customizable composites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its applications increasingly find their way into economics, political science, and sociology. We offer a brief introduction to this vast toolbox and illustrate its current uses in the social sciences, including distilling measures from new data sources, such as text and images; characterizing population heterogeneity; improving causal inference; and offering predictions to aid policy decisions and theory development. We argue that, in addition to serving similar purposes in sociology, machine learning tools can speak to long-standing questions on the limitations of the linear modeling framework, the criteria for evaluating empirical findings, transparency around the context of discovery, and the epistemological core of the discipline.

Advanced "omics" coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence (deep learning) methods have helped elucidate targets and pathways critical to those processes that may be amenable to pharmacologic modulation. However, the current anti-cancer therapeutic armamentarium continues to lag behind. As the cost of developing a new drug remains prohibitively expensive, repurposing of existing approved and investigational drugs is sought after given known safety profiles and reduction in the cost barrier. Notably, successes in oncologic drug repurposing have been infrequent. Computational in-silico strategies have been developed to aid in modeling biological processes to find new disease-relevant targets and discovering novel drug-target and drug-phenotype associations. Machine and deep learning methods have especially enabled leaps in those successes. This review will discuss these methods as they pertain to cancer biology as well as immunomodulation for drug repurposing opportunities in oncologic diseases.

J	Geer, AJ				Geer, A. J.			Learning earth system models from observations: machine learning or data assimilation?	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						machine learning; data assimilation; earth system modelling; inverse methods; remote sensing	NEURAL-NETWORK EMULATION; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; LONGWAVE RADIATION; ATMOSPHERIC MODEL; PART I; WEATHER; PHYSICS; SIMULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY	Recent progress in machine learning (ML) inspires the idea of improving (or learning) earth system models directly from the observations. Earth sciences already use data assimilation (DA), which underpins decades of progress in weather forecasting. DA and ML have many similarities: they are both inverse methods that can be united under a Bayesian (probabilistic) framework. ML could benefit from approaches used in DA, which has evolved to deal with real observations-these are uncertain, sparsely sampled, and only indirectly sensitive to the processes of interest. DA could also become more like ML and start learning improved models of the earth system, using parameter estimation, or by directly incorporating machine-learnable models. DA follows the Bayesian approach more exactly in terms of representing uncertainty, and in retaining existing physical knowledge, which helps to better constrain the learnt aspects of models. This article makes equivalences between DA and ML in the unifying framework of Bayesian networks. These help illustrate the equivalences between four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) DA and a recurrent neural network (RNN), for example. More broadly, Bayesian networks are graphical representations of the knowledge and processes embodied in earth system models, giving a framework for organising modelling components and knowledge, whether coming from physical equations or learnt from observations. Their full Bayesian solution is not computationally feasible but these networks can be solved with approximate methods already used in DA and ML, so they could provide a practical framework for the unification of the two. Development of all these approaches could address the strand challenge of making better use of observations, improve physical models of earth system processes. This article is part of the theme issue 'Machine learning weather and climate modeling.	[Geer, A.

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.

Landslide susceptibility models prepared in a Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated environment can be key for formulating disaster prevention measures and mitigating future risk. The accuracy and precision of susceptibility models is evolving rapidly from opinion-driven models and statistical learning toward increased use of machine learning techniques. Critical reviews on opinion-driven models and statistical learning in landslide susceptibility mapping have been published, but an overview of current machine learning models for landslide susceptibility studies, including background information on their operation, implementation, and performance is currently lacking. Here, we present an overview of the most popular machine learning techniques available for landslide susceptibility studies. We find that only a handful of researchers use machine learning techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping studies. Therefore, we present the architecture of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in plain language, so as to be understandable to a broad range of geoscientists. Furthermore, a comprehensive study comparing the performance of various ML algorithms is absent from the current literature, making an assessment of comparative performance and predictive capabilities difficult. We therefore undertake an extensive analysis and comparison between different ML techniques using a case study from Algeria. We summarize and discuss the algorithm's accuracies, advantages and limitations using a range of evaluation criteria. We note that tree-based ensemble algorithms achieve excellent results compared to other machine learning algorithms and that the Random Forest algorithm offers robust performance for accurate landslide susceptibility mapping with only a small number of adjustments required before training the model.

Building load prediction is one of the most critical components for many building control and analytics activities, as well as grid-interactive and energy efficiency building operation. While a large number of research papers exist on the topic of machine-learning-based building load prediction, a comprehensive review from the perspective of machine learning is missing. In this paper, we review the application of machine learning techniques in building load prediction under the organization and logic of the machine learning, which is to perform tasks T using Performance measure P and based on learning from Experience E. Firstly, we review the applications of building load prediction model (task T). Then, we review the modeling algorithms that improve machine learning performance and accuracy (performance P). Throughout the papers, we also review the literature from the data perspective for modeling (experience E), including data engineering from the sensor level to data level, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of well-studied and relatively unexplored fields for future research reference. We also identify the gaps in current machine learning application and predict for future trends and development.

A subset of artificial intelligence, namely machine learning, has a considerable potential to handle numerous challenges in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems. The present study aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing the recent scholarly literature based on keywords' combinations of "machine learning" along with "crop management", "water management", "soil management", and "livestock management", and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers were considered eligible that were published within 2018-2020. The results indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines that favour convergence research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was observed to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient. In addition, maize and wheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated crops and animals, respectively. Finally, a variety of sensors, attached on satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been utilized as a means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated that this study will constitute a beneficial guide to all stakeholders towards enhancing awareness of the potential advantages of using machine learning in agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research on this topic.

In large-scale systems, there are several types of noise that can affect the performance of distributed machine learning algorithms-straggler nodes, system failures, or communication bottlenecks-but there has been little interaction cutting across codes, machine learning, and distributed systems. In this paper, we provide theoretical insights on how coded solutions can achieve significant gains compared with uncoded ones. We focus on two of the most basic building blocks of distributed learning algorithms: matrix multiplication and data shuffling. For matrix multiplication, we use codes to alleviate the effect of stragglers and show that if the number of homogeneous workers is n, and the runtime of each subtask has an exponential tail, coded computation can speed up distributed matrix multiplication by a factor of log n. For data shuffling, we use codes to reduce communication bottlenecks, exploiting the excess in storage. We show that when a constant fraction a of the data matrix can be cached at each worker, and n is the number of workers, coded shuffling reduces the communication cost by a factor of (alpha + 1/n)gamma(n) compared with uncoded shuffling, where gamma(n) is the ratio of the cost of unicasting n messages to n users to multicasting a common message (of the same size) to n users. For instance, gamma(n) similar or equal to n if multicasting a message to n users is as cheap as unicasting a message to one user. We also provide experimental results, corroborating our theoretical gains of the coded algorithms.

Machine Learning for Survival Analysis: A Survey	ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS			English	Article						Machine learning; survival analysis; censoring; regression; hazard rate; Cox model; concordance index; survival data	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE; VARIABLE SELECTION; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; BREAST-CANCER; CENSORED-DATA; REGRESSION; MODEL; REGULARIZATION; PREDICTION	Survival analysis is a subfield of statistics where the goal is to analyze and model data where the outcome is the time until an event of interest occurs. One of the main challenges in this context is the presence of instances whose event outcomes become unobservable after a certain time point or when some instances do not experience any event during the monitoring period. This so-called censoring can be handled most effectively using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome the issue of censoring. In addition, many machine learning algorithms have been adapted to deal with such censored data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the statistical methods typically used and the machine learning techniques developed for survival analysis, along with a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and describe several successful applications in a variety of real-world application domains. We hope that this article will give readers a more comprehensive understanding of recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines for applying these approaches to solve new problems arising in applications involving censored data.

However, it has also been shown that adversarial input perturbations carefully crafted either at training or at test time can easily subvert their predictions. The vulnerability of machine learning to such wild patterns (also referred to as adversarial examples), along with the design of suitable countermeasures, have been investigated in the research field of adversarial machine learning. In this work, we provide a thorough overview of the evolution of this research area over the last ten years and beyond, starting from pioneering, earlier work on the security of non-deep learning algorithms up to more recent work aimed to understand the security properties of deep learning algorithms, in the context of computer vision and cybersecurity tasks. We report interesting connections between these apparently-different lines of work, highlighting common misconceptions related to the security evaluation of machine-learning algorithms. We review the main threat models and attacks defined to this end, and discuss the main limitations of current work, along with the corresponding future challenges towards the design of more secure learning algorithms.

These feature transformations, also called descriptors, are a key step in building machine learning models for property prediction in materials science. Solution method: We have developed a library for creating common descriptors used in machine learning applied to materials science. We provide an implementation the following descriptors: Coulomb matrix, Ewald sum matrix, sine matrix, Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR), Atom centered Symmetry Functions (ACSF) and Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP). The library has a python interface with computationally intensive routines written in C or C++. The source code, tutorials and documentation are provided online. A continuous integration mechanism is set up to automatically run a series of regression tests and check code coverage when the codebase is updated. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Bengio, Y; Lodi, A; Prouvost, A				Bengio, Yoshua; Lodi, Andrea; Prouvost, Antoine			Machine learning for combinatorial optimization: A methodological tour d'horizon	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Review						Combinatorial optimization; Machine learning; Branch and bound; Mixed-integer programming solvers	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SEARCH	This paper surveys the recent attempts, both from the machine learning and operations research communities, at leveraging machine learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Given the hard nature of these problems, state-of-the-art algorithms rely on handcrafted heuristics for making decisions that are otherwise too expensive to compute or mathematically not well defined. Thus, machine learning looks like a natural candidate to make such decisions in a more principled and optimized way. We advocate for pushing further the integration of machine learning and combinatorial optimization and detail a methodology to do so. A main point of the paper is seeing generic optimization problems as data points and inquiring what is the relevant distribution of problems to use for learning on a given task.

This review focuses on challenges points to be clarified about how to develop AI applications as clinical decision support systems in the real-world context. Methods: A narrative review has been performed including a critical assessment of articles published between 1989 and 2021 that guided challenging sections. Results: We first illustrate the architectural characteristics of machine learning (ML)/radiomics and deep learning (DL) approaches. For ML/radiomics, the phases of feature selection and of training, validation, and testing are described. DL models are presented as multi-layered artificial/convolutional neural networks, allowing us to directly process images. The data curation section includes technical steps such as image labelling, image annotation (with segmentation as a crucial step in radiomics), data harmonization (enabling compensation for differences in imaging protocols that typically generate noise in non-AI imaging studies) and federated learning. Thereafter, we dedicate specific sections to: sample size calculation, considering multiple testing in AI approaches; procedures for data augmentation to work with limited and unbalanced datasets; and the interpretability of AI models (the so-called black box issue). Pros and cons for choosing ML versus DL to implement AI applications to medical imaging are finally presented in a synoptic way. Conclusions: Biomedicine and healthcare systems are one of the most important fields for AI applications and medical imaging is probably the most suitable and promising domain. Clarification of specific challenging points facilitates the development of such systems and their translation to clinical practice.

Several machine learning algorithms have been applied to support crop yield prediction research. In this study, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to extract and synthesize the algorithms and features that have been used in crop yield prediction studies. Based on our search criteria, we retrieved 567 relevant studies from six electronic databases, of which we have selected 50 studies for further analysis using inclusion and exclusion criteria. We investigated these selected studies carefully, analyzed the methods and features used, and provided suggestions for further research. According to our analysis, the most used features are temperature, rainfall, and soil type, and the most applied algorithm is Artificial Neural Networks in these models. After this observation based on the analysis of machine learning-based 50 papers, we performed an additional search in electronic databases to identify deep learning-based studies, reached 30 deep learning-based papers, and extracted the applied deep learning algorithms. According to this additional analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is the most widely used deep learning algorithm in these studies, and the other widely used deep learning algorithms are Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN).

The complex and time-consuming calculations in molecular simulations are particularly suitable for anML revolution and have already been profoundly affected by the application of existing ML methods. Here we review recent ML methods for molecular simulation, with particular focus on (deep) neural networks for the prediction of quantum-mechanical energies and forces, on coarse-grained molecular dynamics, on the extraction of free energy surfaces and kinetics, and on generative network approaches to sample molecular equilibrium structures and compute thermodynamics. To explain these methods and illustrate open methodological problems, we review some important principles of molecular physics and describe how they can be incorporated into ML structures. Finally, we identify and describe a list of open challenges for the interface between ML and molecular simulation.

Machine learning in medicine: a practical introduction	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Medical informatics; Classification; Supervised machine learning; Programming languages; Diagnosis; Computer-assisted; Decision making; Computer-assisted	DIAGNOSIS; CANCER	BackgroundFollowing visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data.MethodsWe demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples.We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment.ResultsThe trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble.ConclusionsWe use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.	[Sidey-Gibbons, Jenni A.

Various intrusion detection techniques are used, but their performance is an issue. Intrusion detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such techniques indicate limitations and are not effcient for use in large data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection system is used in analyzing huge traffc data; thus, an effcient classifcation technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem is considered in this paper. Well-known machine learning techniques, namely, SVM, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM) are applied. These techniques are well-known because of their capability in classifcation. The NSL-knowledge discovery and data mining data set is used, which is considered a benchmark in the evaluation of intrusion detection mechanisms. The results indicate that ELM outperforms other approaches.

Landslide modeling of the study area of Van Chan district, Yen Bai province (Vietnam) was carried out with the help of a spatial database of the area, considering past landslides and 12 landslide conditioning factors. The proposed models were validated using different methods such as Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results indicate that the RFBFDT (AUC = 0.826, MSE = 0.189, and RMSE = 0.434) is the best method in comparison to other hybrid models, namely PSOANFIS (AUC = 0.76, MSE = 0.225, and RMSE = 0.474) and PSOANN (AUC = 0.72, MSE = 0.312, and RMSE = 0.558). Thus, it is reasonably concluded that the RFBFDT is a promising hybrid machine learning approach for landslide susceptibility modeling.

To fit a machine learning model into different problems, its hyper-parameters must be tuned. Selecting the best hyperparameter configuration for machine learning models has a direct impact on the model's performance. It often requires deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms and appropriate hyper-parameter optimization techniques. Although several automatic optimization techniques exist, they have different strengths and drawbacks when applied to different types of problems. In this paper, optimizing the hyper-parameters of common machine learning models is studied. We introduce several state-of-theart optimization techniques and discuss how to apply them to machine learning algorithms. Many available libraries and frameworks developed for hyper-parameter optimization problems are provided, and some open challenges of hyper-parameter optimization research are also discussed in this paper. Moreover, experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to compare the performance of different optimization methods and provide practical examples of hyper-parameter optimization. This survey paper will help industrial users, data analysts, and researchers to better develop machine learning models by identifying the proper hyper-parameter configurations effectively.

J	Yao, L; Ge, ZQ				Yao, Le; Ge, Zhiqiang			Deep Learning of Semisupervised Process Data With Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine and Soft Sensor Application	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Deep learning (DL); extreme learning machine (ELM); manifold regularization; semisupervised learning; soft sensor		Data-driven soft sensors have been widely utilized in industrial processes to estimate the critical quality variables which are intractable to directly measure online through physical devices. Due to the low sampling rate of quality variables, most of the soft sensors are developed on small number of labeled samples and the large number of unlabeled process data is discarded. The loss of information greatly limits the improvement of quality prediction accuracy. One of the main issues of data-driven soft sensor is to furthest exploit the information contained in all available process data. This paper proposes a semisupervised deep learning model for soft sensor development based on the hierarchical extreme learning machine (HELM). First, the deep network structure of autoencoders is implemented for unsupervised feature extraction with all the process samples. Then, extreme learning machine is utilized for regression through appending the quality variable. Meanwhile, the manifold regularization method is introduced for semisupervised model training. The new method can not only deeply extract the information that the data contains, but learn more from the extra unlabeled samples as well. The proposed semisupervised HELM method is applied in a high-low transformer to estimate the carbon monoxide content, which shows a significant improvement of the prediction accuracy, compared to traditional methods.

However, it is the performance of the hardware, in particular the energy efficiency of a computing system that sets the fundamental limit of the capability of machine learning. Data-centric computing requires a revolution in hardware systems, since traditional digital computers based on transistors and the von Neumann architecture were not purposely designed for neuromorphic computing. A hardware platform based on emerging devices and new architecture is the hope for future computing with dramatically improved throughput and energy efficiency. Building such a system, nevertheless, faces a number of challenges, ranging from materials selection, device optimization, circuit fabrication and system integration, to name a few. The aim of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of emerging hardware technologies that are potentially beneficial for machine learning, providing the Nanotechnology readers with a perspective of challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field.

Many studies highlight the use of empirical and theoretical techniques in predicting TBM performance. However, reliable performance prediction of TBM is of crucial importance to mining and civil projects as it can minimize the risks associated with capital costs. This study presents new applications of supervised machine learning techniques, i.e., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID), support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART) and neural network (NN) in predicting the penetration rate (PR) of a TBM. To achieve this aim, an experimental database was set up, based on field observations and laboratory tests for a tunneling project in Malaysia. In the database, uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, rock quality designation, weathering zone, thrust force, and revolution per minute were utilized as inputs to predict PR of TBM. Then, KNN, CHAID, SVM, CART, and NN predictive models were developed to select the best one. A simple ranking technique, as well as some performance indices, were calculated for each developed model. According to the obtained results, KNN received the highest-ranking value among all five predictive models and was selected as the best predictive model of this study. It can be concluded that KNN is able to provide high-performance capacity in predicting TBM PR. KNN model identified uniaxial compressive strength (0.2) as the most important and revolution per minutes (0.14) as the least important factor for predicting the TBM penetration rate.

To exploit this wealth of information, machine learning is necessary to automate tasks such as taxonomic classification. Through a review of the literature, we highlight the progress of those machine classifiers and what they can and still cannot be trusted for. Several examples showcase how the combination of quantitative imaging with machine learning has brought insights on pelagic ecology. They also highlight what is still missing and how images could be exploited further through trait-based approaches. In the future, we suggest deeper interactions with the computer sciences community, the adoption of data standards, and the more systematic sharing of databases to build a global community of pelagic image providers and users.

Selecting appropriate machine learning methods for digital soil mapping	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Algorithm selection; Digital soil mapping; Machine learning; Model evaluation	ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; RANDOM FOREST; SPATIAL PREDICTION; SEMIARID REGION; REGRESSION; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION	Digital soil mapping (DSM) increasingly makes use of machine learning algorithms to identify relationships between soil properties and multiple covariates that can be detected across landscapes. Selecting the appropriate algorithm for model building is critical for optimizing results in the context of the available data. Over the past decade, many studies have tested different machine learning (ML) approaches on a variety of soil data sets. Here, we review the application of some of the most popular ML algorithms for digital soil mapping. Specifically, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), Cubist, random forest (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for DSM. These algorithms were compared on the basis of five factors: (1) quantity of hyperparameters, (2) sample size, (3) covariate selection, (4) learning time, and (5) interpretability of the resulting model. If training time is a limitation, then algorithms that have fewer model parameters and hyperparameters should be considered, e.g., MLR, KNN, SVR, and Cubist. If the data set is large (thousands of samples) and computation time is not an issue, ANN would likely produce the best results. If the data set is small (<100), then Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR are likely to perform better than ANN and MLR. The uncertainty in predictions produced by Cubist, KNN, RF, and SVR may not decrease with large datasets. When interpretability of the resulting model is important to the user, Cubist, MLR, and RF are more appropriate algorithms as they do not function as "black boxes." There is no one correct approach to produce models for predicting the spatial distribution of soil properties. Nonetheless, some algorithms are more appropriate than others considering the nature of the data and purpose of mapping activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, wind energy has several challenges, such as initial investment costs, the stationary property of wind plants, and the difficulty in finding wind-efficient energy areas. In this study, long-term wind power forecasting was performed based on daily wind speed data using five machine learning algorithms. We proposed a method based on machine learning algorithms to forecast wind power values efficiently. We conducted several case studies to reveal performances of machine learning algorithms. The results showed that machine learning algorithms could be used for forecasting long-term wind power values with respect to historical wind speed data. Furthermore, the results showed that machine learning-based models could be applied to a location different from model-trained locations. This study demonstrated that machine learning algorithms could be successfully used before the establishment of wind plants in an unknown geographical location whether it is logical by using the model of a base location.

Machine learning techniques are being increasingly adapted for use in the medical field because of their high accuracy. This study investigated the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. Methods-This was a retrospective study using a prospective cohort that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0, 1, or 2 at 3 months. We developed 3 machine learning models (deep neural network, random forest, and logistic regression) and compared their predictability. To evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models, we also compared them to the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) score. Results-A total of 2604 patients were included in this study, and 2043 (78%) of them had favorable outcomes. The area under the curve for the deep neural network model was significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score (0.888 versus 0.839; P<0.001), while the areas under the curves of the random forest (0.857; P=0.136) and logistic regression (0.849; P=0.413) models were not significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score. Using only the 6 variables that are used for the ASTRAL score, the performance of the machine learning models did not significantly differ from that of the ASTRAL score. Conclusions-Machine learning algorithms, particularly the deep neural network, can improve the prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.

However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application's manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK's Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.

J	Belkin, M; Hsu, D; Ma, SY; Mandal, S				Belkin, Mikhail; Hsu, Daniel; Ma, Siyuan; Mandal, Soumik			Reconciling modern machine-learning practice and the classical bias-variance trade-off	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						machine learning; bias-variance trade-off; neural networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This "double-descent" curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias-variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.

The absorption analysis for two complementary metasurface-based designs is presented. The complementary circular array metasurface design and circular array metasurface design are investigated for visible, infrared, and ultraviolet regions with a wavelength range of 0.2 mu m-0.8 mu m. The highest average absorption is observed for complementary circular array metasurface design. This design is further investigated for different parameter variations like resonator thickness, SiO2 height, SiO(2 )width, and graphene chemical potential. All these parameter variations and their absorption results are also predicted with machine learning algorithms. Experiments are performed using different degrees of polynomial regression models for predicting the absorption values for missing/intermediate wavelengths. Two test cases R-30 and R-50 are designed to test the regressor models and R-2 Score metric is used to test the prediction efficiency of the regressor model. It is observed from the experimental results that, prediction efficiency of more than 0.99 (R-2) can be achieved using higher degree polynomial regression models. The proposed metasurface-based solar absorber design can be used for solar energy harvesting applications.

Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.

BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						mechanistic modelling; machine learning; quantitative biology		Ninety per cent of the world's data have been generated in the last 5 years (Machine learning: the power and promise of computers that learn by example. Report no. DES4702. Issued April 2017. Royal Society). A small fraction of these data is collected with the aim of validating specific hypotheses. These studies are led by the development of mechanistic models focused on the causality of input-output relationships. However, the vast majority is aimed at supporting statistical or correlation studies that bypass the need for causality and focus exclusively on prediction. Along these lines, there has been a vast increase in the use of machine learning models, in particular in the biomedical and clinical sciences, to try and keep pace with the rate of data generation. Recent successes now beg the question of whether mechanistic models are still relevant in this area. Said otherwise, why should we try to understand the mechanisms of disease progression when we can use machine learning tools to directly predict disease outcome?

Machine learning for internet of things data analysis: a survey	DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS			English	Review						Machine learning; Internet of Things; Smart data; Smart City	BIG DATA; SUPPORT; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; TUTORIAL; NETWORKS; MODEL; CITY	Rapid developments in hardware, software, and communication technologies have facilitated the emergence of Internet-connected sensory devices that provide observations and data measurements from the physical world. By 2020, it is estimated that the total number of Internet-connected devices being used will be between 25 and 50 billion. As these numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume of data being published will increase. The technology of Internet-connected devices, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and cyber worlds. In addition to an increased volume, the IoT generates big data characterized by its velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this big data are the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses the various machine learning methods that deal with the challenges presented by IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case. The key contribution of this study is the presentation of a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms explaining how different techniques are applied to the data in order to extract higher level information. The potential and challenges of machine learning for IoT data analytics will also be discussed. A use case of applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to Aarhus smart city traffic data is presented for a more detailed exploration.

Early detection accompanied by prompt treatment can reduce the risk of death due to breast cancer. Currently, machine learning in cloud computing plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis, but predominantly among the people living in remote areas where medical facilities are scarce. Diagnosis systems based on machine learning act as secondary readers and assist radiologists in the proper diagnosis of diseases, whereas cloud-based systems can support telehealth services and remote diagnostics. Techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANN) have attracted many researchers to explore their capability for disease diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the variants of ANN that has a huge potential for solving various classification problems. The framework proposed in this paper amalgamates three research domains: Firstly, ELM is applied for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Secondly, to eliminate insignificant features, the gain ratio feature selection method is employed. Lastly, a cloud computing-based system for remote diagnosis of breast cancer using ELM is proposed. The performance of the cloud-based ELM is compared with some state-of-the-art technologies for disease diagnosis. The results achieved on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WBCD) dataset indicate that the cloud-based ELM technique outperforms other results. The best performance results of ELM were found for both the standalone and cloud environments, which were compared. The important findings of the experimental results indicate that the accuracy achieved is 0.9868, the recall is 0.9130, the precision is 0.9054, and the F1-score is 0.8129.

AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.

J	Huang, WJ; Martin, P; Zhuang, HLL				Huang, Wenjiang; Martin, Pedro; Zhuang, Houlong L.			Machine-learning phase prediction of high-entropy alloys	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						High-entropy alloys; Phase selection; Machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BULK METALLIC GLASSES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; BEHAVIOR; ELEMENTS; KERNEL; MICROSTRUCTURE; CLASSIFIERS	High-entropy alloys (HEM) have been receiving intensive attention due to their unusual properties that largely depend on the selection among three phases: solid solution (SS), intermetallic compound (IM), and mixed SS and IM (SS + IM). Accurate phase prediction is therefore crucial for guiding the selection of a combination of elements to form a HEA with desirable properties. It is widely accepted that the phase selection is correlated with elemental features such as valence electron concentration and the formation enthalpy, leading to a set of parametric phase-selection rules [1]. Previous studies on predicting the phase selection employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain some correlated parameters. But DFT calculations are time consuming and exhibit uncertainties in terms of treating the d orbitals of transition-metal atoms that are often components of HEAs. Here we employ machine learning (ML) algorithms to efficiently explore phase selection rules using a comprehensive experimental dataset consisting of 401 different HEAs including 174 SS, 54 IM, and 173 SS + IM phases. We adopt three different ML algorithms: K-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). To avoid overfitting, we divide the whole dataset into four nearly equal portions to perform a cross validation. For the classification of the three phases at the same time, the testing accuracy values from the KNN, SVM and ANN calculations achieve 68.6%, 64.3% and 743%, respectively. We then focus on the classification of two of the three phases using SVM and ANN. We find that the testing accuracy values using ANN in classifying the SS and IM phases, the SS + IM and IM phases, and the SS and SS + IM phases, are 86.7%, 94.3%, and 78.9%, respectively, which are higher than the corresponding testing accuracy values using SVM. As such, the trained ANN model performs the best among the three ML algorithms and is useful for predicting the phases of new HEAs. Our work provides an alternative route of computational design of HEAs, which is also applicable to accelerate the discovery of other metal alloys for modern engineering applications.

We critically review the burgeoning literature dedicated to Energy Economics/Finance applications of ML. Our review identifies applications in areas such as predicting energy prices (e.g. crude oil, natural gas, and power), demand forecasting, risk management, trading strategies, data processing, and analyzing macro/energy trends. We critically review the content (methods and findings) of more than 130 articles published between 2005 and 2018. Our analysis suggests that Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are among the most popular techniques used in energy economics papers. We discuss the achievements and limitations of existing literature. The survey concludes by identifying current gaps and offering some suggestions for future research. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The general formulations of the grey system models have been firstly summarized, and then the nonlinear extensions with general formulations of the grey models have also been developed. The kernel implicit mapping is used to estimate the unknown nonlinear function of the GML model, by extending the nonparametric formulation of the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM), the estimation of the nonlinear function of the GML model can also be expressed by the kernels. Short discussions on the priority of this new framework to the existing grey models and LSSVM have also been presented. The open issues have been noted in detail.

However, it is still challenging to develop effective diagnostic method with insufficient training data, which is highly demanded in real-industrial scenarios, since high-quality data are usually difficult and expensive to collect. Considering the underlying similarities of rotating machines, data mining on different but related equipments potentially benefit the diagnostic performance on the target machine. Therefore, a novel transfer learning method for diagnostics based on deep learning is proposed in this article, where the diagnostic knowledge learned from sufficient supervised data of multiple rotating machines is transferred to the target equipment with domain adversarial training. Different from the existing studies, a more generalized transfer learning problem with different label spaces of domains is investigated, and different fault severities are also considered in fault diagnostics. The experimental results on four datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show it is feasible and promising to explore different datasets to improve diagnostic performance.

The Baishuihe, Shuping, and Baijiabao landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir area of China were used for case studies. Cumulative displacement was decom-posed into trend displacement and periodic displacement by the Hodrick-Prescott filter. The double exponential smoothing method and the five machine learning methods were used to predict the trend and periodic displacement, respectively. The five machine learning methods are compared in three aspects: highest single prediction accuracy, mean prediction accuracy, and prediction stability. The results show that no method per -formed the best for all three aspects in the three landslide cases. LSTM and PSO-ELM achieved better single prediction accuracy, but worse mean prediction accuracy and stability. PSO-KELM, PSO-LSSVM, and PSO-SVM always yielded consistent predictions with slight variations. On the whole, PSO-KELM and PSO-LSSVM are recommended for their superior mean prediction accuracy and prediction stability.

J	Wei, LY; Hu, J; Li, FY; Song, JN; Su, R; Zou, Q				Wei, Leyi; Hu, Jie; Li, Fuyi; Song, Jiangning; Su, Ran; Zou, Quan			Comparative analysis and prediction of quorum-sensing peptides using feature representation learning and machine learning algorithms	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Review						quorum-sensing peptide; feature descriptors; feature representation learning; machine learning; sequence analysis	TO-CELL COMMUNICATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; GENE-EXPRESSION; SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; RESIDUES; BACTERIA; SIGNAL	Quorum-sensing peptides (QSPs) are the signal molecules that are closely associated with diverse cellular processes, such as cell-cell communication, and gene expression regulation in Gram-positive bacteria. It is therefore of great importance to identify QSPs for better understanding and in-depth revealing of their functional mechanisms in physiological processes. Machine learning algorithms have been developed for this purpose, showing the great potential for the reliable prediction of QSPs. In this study, several sequence-based feature descriptors for peptide representation and machine learning algorithms are comprehensively reviewed, evaluated and compared. To effectively use existing feature descriptors, we used a feature representation learning strategy that automatically learns the most discriminative features from existing feature descriptors in a supervised way. Our results demonstrate that this strategy is capable of effectively capturing the sequence determinants to represent the characteristics of QSPs, thereby contributing to the improved predictive performance. Furthermore, wrapping this feature representation learning strategy, we developed a powerful predictor named QSPred-FL for the detection of QSPs in large-scale proteomic data. Benchmarking results with 10-fold cross validation showed that QSPred-FL is able to achieve better performance as compared to the state-of-the-art predictors. In addition, we have established a user-friendly webserver that implements QSPred-FL, which is currently available at http://server.malab.cn/QSPred- FL. We expect that this tool will be useful for the high-throughput prediction of QSPs and the discovery of important functional mechanisms of QSPs.

Machine learning for metal additive manufacturing: Towards a physics-informed data-driven paradigm	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Review						Machine learning; Deep learning; Additive manufacturing; Physics of manufacturing processes	POWDER-BED FUSION; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; MELT-POOL; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ANOMALY DETECTION; LASER; PREDICTION; QUALITY; BEHAVIOR	Machine learning (ML) has shown to be an effective alternative to physical models for quality prediction and process optimization of metal additive manufacturing (AM). However, the inherent "black box " nature of ML techniques such as those represented by artificial neural networks has often presented a challenge to interpret ML outcomes in the framework of the complex thermodynamics that govern AM. While the practical benefits of ML provide an adequate justification, its utility as a reliable modeling tool is ultimately reliant on assured consistency with physical principles and model transparency. To facilitate the fundamental needs, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a hybrid machine learning paradigm that imbues ML models with physical domain knowledge such as thermomechanical laws and constraints. The distinguishing feature of PIML is the synergistic integration of data-driven methods that reflect system dynamics in real-time with the governing physics underlying AM. In this paper, the current state-of-the-art in metal AM is reviewed and opportunities for a paradigm shift to PIML are discussed, thereby identifying relevant future research directions.

With its ability to solve complex tasks autonomously, ML is being exploited as a radically new way to help find material correlations, understand materials chemistry, and accelerate the discovery of materials. Here, an in-depth review of the application of ML to energy materials, including rechargeable alkali-ion batteries, photovoltaics, catalysts, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, and superconductors, is presented. A conceptual framework is first provided for ML in materials science, with a broad overview of different ML techniques as well as best practices. This is followed by a critical discussion of how ML is applied in energy materials. This review is concluded with the perspectives on major challenges and opportunities in this exciting field.

Today, increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms may grow to support clinical experts in some of these tasks. Machine learning has the potential to benefit patients and cardiologists, but only if clinicians take an active role in bringing these new algorithms into practice. The aim of this review is to introduce clinicians who are not data science experts to key concepts in machine learning that will allow them to better understand the field and evaluate new literature and developments. The current published data in machine learning for cardiovascular disease is then summarized, using both a bibliometric survey, with code publicly available to enable similar analysis for any research topic of interest, and select case studies. Finally, several ways that clinicians can and must be involved in this emerging field are presented. (C) 2021 The Authors.

A survey on semi-supervised learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Machine learning; Classification	UNLABELED DATA; RANDOM FOREST; MANIFOLD REGULARIZATION; ROBUST; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; MACHINE; GRAPH; SOFTWARE; DROPOUT	Semi-supervised learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with using labelled as well as unlabelled data to perform certain learning tasks. Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.

Machine learning techniques have already been successfully applied to active-matter data-for example, deep neural networks to analyse images and track objects, and recurrent nets and random forests to analyse time series. Yet machine learning can also help to disentangle the complexity of biological active matter, helping, for example, to establish a relation between genetic code and emergent bacterial behaviour, to find navigation strategies in complex environments, and to map physical cues to animal behaviours. In this Review, we highlight the current state of the art in the application of machine learning to active matter and discuss opportunities and challenges that are emerging. We also emphasize how active matter and machine learning can work together for mutual benefit. This Review surveys machine learning techniques that are currently developed for a range of research topics in biological and artificial active matter and also discusses challenges and exciting opportunities. This research direction promises to help disentangle the complexity of active matter and gain fundamental insights for instance in collective behaviour of systems at many length scales from colonies of bacteria to animal flocks.

CMP overlaps with many other important branches of science, such as chemistry, materials science, statistical physics, and high-performance computing. With the advancements in modern machine learning (ML) technology, a keen interest in applying these algorithms to further CMP research has created a compelling new area of research at the intersection of both fields. In this review, we aim to explore the main areas within CMP, which have successfully applied ML techniques to further research, such as the description and use of ML schemes for potential energy surfaces, the characterization of topological phases of matter in lattice systems, the prediction of phase transitions in off-lattice and atomistic simulations, the interpretation of ML theories with physics-inspired frameworks and the enhancement of simulation methods with ML algorithms. We also discuss in detail the main challenges and drawbacks of using ML methods on CMP problems, as well as some perspectives for future developments.

There are largely two reasons data collection has recently become a critical issue. First, as machine learning is becoming more widely-used, we are seeing new applications that do not necessarily have enough labeled data. Second, unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning techniques automatically generate features, which saves feature engineering costs, but in return may require larger amounts of labeled data. Interestingly, recent research in data collection comes not only from the machine learning, natural language, and computer vision communities, but also from the data management community due to the importance of handling large amounts of data. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive study of data collection from a data management point of view. Data collection largely consists of data acquisition, data labeling, and improvement of existing data or models. We provide a research landscape of these operations, provide guidelines on which technique to use when, and identify interesting research challenges. The integration of machine learning and data management for data collection is part of a larger trend of Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration and opens many opportunities for new research.

With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) techniques, ML-based SFs have gradually emerged as a promising alternative for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction and virtual screening, and most of them have shown significantly better performance than a wide range of classical SFs. Emergence of more data-hungry deep learning (DL) approaches in recent years further fascinates the exploitation of more accurate SFs. Here, we summarize the progress of traditional ML-based SFs in the last few years and provide insights into recently developed DL-based SFs. We believe that the continuous improvement in ML-based SFs can surely guide the early-stage drug design and accelerate the discovery of new drugs.

First, the method needs to consider how to encourage devices to cooperate when they are selfish. Second, the method answers the following question: how can collaborative computing be carried out when the device has the intention to cooperate? For example, how can calculations be conducted when there are extensibility and privacy problems in machine learning tasks? In view of the above challenges, a mobile edge server is taken as the focus, and the available resources around the mobile edge server are used for collaborative computing to further improve the computing performance of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system. The alternating direction multiplier method is used to solve the problem. First, the relevant techniques and theories of MEC, Stackelberg principle -subordinate game theory, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are introduced. Then, the problem description and model construction of distributed task scheduling in MEC and machine learning task-based device coordination computing are introduced, and machine learning is applied in the distributed task scheduling algorithm and distributed device coordination algorithm. Finally, the distributed task scheduling algorithm and distributed device coordination algorithm are tested by experiments. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Heid, E; Green, WH				Heid, Esther; Green, William H.			Machine Learning of Reaction Properties via Learned Representations of the Condensed Graph of Reaction	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							CHEMICAL-REACTIONS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODEL	The estimation of chemical reaction properties such as activation energies, rates, or yields is a central topic of computational chemistry. In contrast to molecular properties, where machine learning approaches such as graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have excelled for a wide variety of tasks, no general and transferable adaptations of GCNNs for reactions have been developed yet We therefore combined a popular cheminformatics reaction representation, the so-called condensed graph of reaction (CGR), with a recent GCNN architecture to arrive at a versatile, robust, and compact deep learning model The CGR is a superposition of the reactant and product graphs of a chemical reaction and thus an ideal input for graph-based machine learning approaches. The model learns to create a data-driven, task-dependent reaction embedding that does not rely on expert knowledge, similar to current molecular GCNNs. Our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art models in accuracy, is applicable even to imbalanced reactions, and possesses excellent predictive capabilities for diverse target properties, such as activation energies, reaction enthalpies, rate constants, yields, or reaction classes. We furthermore curated a large set of atom-mapped reactions along with their target properties, which can serve as benchmark data sets for future work. All data sets and the developed reaction GCNN model are available online, free of charge, and open source.

J	Shao, SY; McAleer, S; Yan, RQ; Baldi, P				Shao, Siyu; McAleer, Stephen; Yan, Ruqiang; Baldi, Pierre			Highly Accurate Machine Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning (DL); fault diagnosis; machine health monitoring; pretrained model; transfer learning (TL)	NEURAL-NETWORKS	We develop a novel deep learning framework to achieve highly accurate machine fault diagnosis using transfer learning to enable and accelerate the training of deep neural network. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method is faster to train and more accurate. First, original sensor data are converted to images by conducting a Wavelet transformation to obtain time-frequency distributions. Next, a pretrained network is used to extract lower level features. The labeled time-frequency images are then used to fine-tune the higher levels of the neural network architecture. This paper creates a machine fault diagnosis pipeline and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and generalization of the pipeline on three main mechanical datasets including induction motors, gearboxes, and bearings with sizes of 6000, 9000, and 5000 time series samples, respectively. We achieve state-of-the-art results on each dataset, with most datasets showing test accuracy near 100%, and in the gearbox dataset, we achieve significant improvement from 94.8% to 99.64%. We created a repository including these datasets located at mlmechanics.ics.uci.edu.

The current state-of-the-art approach to designing and optimizing such structures relies heavily on simplistic, intuitive shapes for their unit cells or metaatoms. Such an approach cannot provide the global solution to a complex optimization problem where metaatom shape, inplane geometry, out-of-plane architecture, and constituent materials have to be properly chosen to yield the maximum performance. In this work, we present a novel machine learning-assisted global optimization framework for photonic metadevice design. We demonstrate that using an adversarial autoencoder (AAE) coupled with a metaheuristic optimization framework significantly enhances the optimization search efficiency of the metadevice configurations with complex topologies. We showcase the concept of physics-driven compressed design space engineering that introduces advanced regularization into the compressed space of an AAE based on the optical responses of the devices. Beyond the significant advancement of the global optimization schemes, our approach can assist in gaining comprehensive design "intuition" by revealing the underlying physics of the optical performance of metadevices with complex topologies and material compositions.

J	Vellido, A				Vellido, Alfredo			The importance of interpretability and visualization in machine learning for applications in medicine and health care	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Workshop on Self-Organizing Maps and Learning Vector Quantization, Clustering and Data Visualization (WSOM)	JUN 28-30, 2017	Nancy, FRANCE	SAMM Lab, Paris Sorbonne, LORIA Lab		Interpretability; Explainability; Machine learning; Visualization; Medicine; Health care	UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES; DEEP; MULTICENTER	In a short period of time, many areas of science have made a sharp transition towards data-dependent methods. In some cases, this process has been enabled by simultaneous advances in data acquisition and the development of networked system technologies. This new situation is particularly clear in the life sciences, where data overabundance has sparked a flurry of new methodologies for data management and analysis. This can be seen as a perfect scenario for the use of machine learning and computational intelligence techniques to address problems in which more traditional data analysis approaches might struggle. But, this scenario also poses some serious challenges. One of them is model interpretability and explainability, especially for complex nonlinear models. In some areas such as medicine and health care, not addressing such challenge might seriously limit the chances of adoption, in real practice, of computer-based systems that rely on machine learning and computational intelligence methods for data analysis. In this paper, we reflect on recent investigations about the interpretability and explainability of machine learning methods and discuss their impact on medicine and health care. We pay specific attention to one of the ways in which interpretability and explainability in this context can be addressed, which is through data and model visualization. We argue that, beyond improving model interpretability as a goal in itself, we need to integrate the medical experts in the design of data analysis interpretation strategies. Otherwise, machine learning is unlikely to become a part of routine clinical and health care practice.

J	Chen, ZS; Li, CH; Sun, WJ				Chen, Zheshi; Li, Chunhong; Sun, Wenjun			Bitcoin price prediction using machine learning: An approach to sample dimension engineering	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Sample dimension engineering; Occam's Razor principle; Bitcoin price prediction; Machine learning algorithms	KRILL HERD ALGORITHM; OCCAMS RAZOR; HYBRID; VOLATILITY; MODEL; GOLD	After the boom and bust of cryptocurrencies' prices in recent years, Bitcoin has been increasingly regarded as an investment asset. Because of its highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Although existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate Bitcoin price prediction, few have focused on the feasibility of applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures and dimensional features. To predict Bitcoin price at different frequencies using machine learning techniques, we first classify Bitcoin price by daily price and high-frequency price. A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66% and 65.3%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2%. Our investigation of Bitcoin price prediction can be considered a pilot study of the importance of the sample dimension in machine learning techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of processes for biodiesel production and use, fast and accurate modeling tools are required for their design, optimization, monitoring, and control. Data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated superior predictive capability compared to conventional methods for modeling such highly complex processes. Among the available ML techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) technology is the most widely used approach in biodiesel research. The ANN approach is a computational learning method that mimics the human brain's neurological processing ability to map input-output relationships of ill-defined systems. Given its high generalization capacity, ANN has gained popularity in dealing with complex nonlinear real-world engineering and scientific problems. This paper is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing various ML technology applications, with a particular focus on ANN, to solve function approximation, optimization, monitoring, and control problems in biodiesel research. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using ML technology in biodiesel research are highlighted to direct future R&D efforts in this domain. ML technology has generally been used in biodiesel research for modeling (trans)esterification processes, physico-chemical characteristics of biodiesel, and biodiesel-fueled internal combustion engines. The primary purpose of introducing ML technology to the biodiesel industry has been to monitor and control biodiesel systems in real-time; however, these issues have rarely been explored in the literature. Therefore, future studies appear to be directed towards the use of ML techniques for real-time process monitoring and control of biodiesel systems to enhance production efficiency, economic viability, and environmental sustainability.

An important element of surgical decision making is identification of the patient cohort that will benefit from surgery before the intervention. Machine learning (ML) enables computers to learn from previous data to make accurate predictions on new data. In this systematic review, we evaluate the potential of ML for neurosurgical outcome prediction. METHODS: A systematic search in the PubMed and Embase databases was performed to identify all potential relevant studies up to January 1, 2017. RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified that evaluated ML algorithms used as prediction models for survival, recurrence, symptom improvement, and adverse events in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, brain tumor, spinal lesions, neurovascular disease, movement disorders, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Depending on the specific prediction task evaluated and the type of input features included, ML models predicted outcomes after neurosurgery with a median accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 94.5% and 0.83, respectively. Compared with logistic regression, ML models performed significantly better and showed a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 15% and 0.06, respectively. Some studies also demonstrated a better performance in ML models compared with established prognostic indices and clinical experts. CONCLUSIONS: In the research setting, ML has been studied extensively, demonstrating an excellent performance in outcome prediction for a wide range of neurosurgical conditions. However, future studies should investigate how ML can be implemented as a practical tool supporting neurosurgical care.	[Senders, Joeky T.; Broekman, Marike L.

J	Brajard, J; Carrassi, A; Bocquet, M; Bertino, L				Brajard, Julien; Carrassi, Alberto; Bocquet, Marc; Bertino, Laurent			Combining data assimilation and machine learning to infer unresolved scale parametrization	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						numerical modelling; data assimilation; machine learning	NEURAL-NETWORK; IDENTIFICATION; CLIMATE	In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been proposed to devise data-driven parametrizations of unresolved processes in dynamical numerical models. In most cases, the ML training leverages high-resolution simulations to provide a dense, noiseless target state. Our goal is to go beyond the use of high-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrization using direct data, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations. The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data assimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the system from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is viewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to emulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the system. Finally, the ML-based parametrization model is added to the physical core truncated model to produce a hybrid model. The DA component of the proposed method relies on an ensemble Kalman filter while the ML parametrization is represented by a neural network. The approach is applied to the two-scale Lorenz model and to MAOOAM, a reduced-order coupled ocean-atmosphere model. We show that in both cases, the hybrid model yields forecasts with better skill than the truncated model. Moreover, the attractor of the system is significantly better represented by the hybrid model than by the truncated model. This article is part of the theme issue 'Machine learning for weather and climate modelling'.

The proposed methodology develops a low-dimensional parametrization of these quantities of interest using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and combines this parametrization with machine learning methods to learn the map between the input parameters and the POD expansion coefficients. The use of particular solutions in the POD expansion provides a way to embed physical constraints, such as boundary conditions and other features of the solution that must be preserved. The relative costs and effectiveness of four different machine learning techniques-neural networks, multivariate polynomial regression, k-nearest-neighbors and decision trees-are explored through two engineering examples. The first example considers prediction of the pressure field around an airfoil, while the second considers prediction of the strain field over a damaged composite panel. The case studies demonstrate the importance of embedding physical constraints within learned models, and also highlight the important point that the amount of model training data available in an engineering setting is often much less than it is in other machine learning applications, making it essential to incorporate knowledge from physical models.

The dawn of computational databases has made the integration of analysis, prediction and discovery the key theme in accelerated alloy research. Advances in machine-learning methods and enhanced data generation have created a fertile ground for computational materials science. Pairing machine learning and alloys has proven to be particularly instrumental in pushing progress in a wide variety of materials, including metallic glasses, high-entropy alloys, shape-memory alloys, magnets, superalloys, catalysts and structural materials. This Review examines the present state of machine-learning-driven alloy research, discusses the approaches and applications in the field and summarizes theoretical predictions and experimental validations. We foresee that the partnership between machine learning and alloys will lead to the design of new and improved systems. Machine learning is enabling a metallurgical renaissance. This Review discusses recent progress in representations, descriptors and interatomic potentials, overviewing metallic glasses, high-entropy alloys, superalloys and shape-memory alloys, magnets and catalysts, and the prediction of mechanical and thermal properties.

Prediction of cardiovascular disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. We have also seen ML techniques being used in recent developments in different areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). Various studies give only a glimpse into predicting heart disease with ML techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel method that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. The prediction model is introduced with different combinations of features and several known classification techniques. We produce an enhanced performance level with an accuracy level of 88.7% through the prediction model for heart disease with the hybrid random forest with a linear model (HRFLM).

We build a taxonomy, which includes three first-level categories: techniques before model building, techniques during modeling building, and techniques after model building. Each category is further characterized by representative analysis tasks, and each task is exemplified by a set of recent influential works.

Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications of ML-HCAs.

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.

Today, as advancements in high-throughput technologies lead to production of large amounts of genomic and epigenomic data, the classification feature of SVMs is expanding its use in cancer genomics, leading to the discovery of new biomarkers, new drug targets, and a better understanding of cancer driver genes. Herein we reviewed the recent progress of SVMs in cancer genomic studies. We intend to comprehend the strength of the SVM learning and its future perspective in cancer genomic applications.

Smart constitutive laws: Inelastic homogenization through machine learning	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Constitutive modeling; Homogenization; Inelasticity; Machine learning; Multiscale modeling	COMPUTATIONAL HOMOGENIZATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; DEFORMATION; GROWTH; SOLIDS	Homogenizing the constitutive response of materials with nonlinear and history-dependent behavior at the microscale is particularly challenging. In this case, the only option is generally to homogenize numerically via concurrent multiscale models (CMMs). Unfortunately, these methods are not practical as their computational cost becomes prohibitive for engineering-scale applications. In this work, we develop an alternative formulation to CMMs that leverage state-of-the-art micromechanical modeling and advanced machine learning techniques to develop what we call smart constitutive laws (SCLs). We propose a training scheme for our SCLs that makes them suitable for arbitrary loading histories, making them equivalent to traditional constitutive models. We also show how to implement a SCL into a traditional finite element solver and investigate the response of an engineering-scale component. We compare our results to those obtained via a high fidelity simulation. Our findings indicate that SCLs can dramatically boost the computational efficiency and scalability of computational homogenization for nonlinear and history-dependent materials with arbitrary microstructures, enabling in this way the automatic and systematic generation of microstructurally-informed constitutive laws that can be adopted for the solution of macro-scale complex structures.

J	Raissi, M; Karniadakis, GE				Raissi, Maziar; Karniadakis, George Em			Hidden physics models: Machine learning of nonlinear partial differential equations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Probabilistic machine learning; System identification; Bayesian modeling; Uncertainty quantification; Fractional equations; Small data	IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS	While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about "big data", useful data is usually "small" and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier-Stokes, Schrodinger, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.

One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.

We classify these models by typical ML steps, including data sources, feature selection and extraction, model selection (classification, regression), validation and decision-making.

We used machine learning models to predict clinical outcomes, and then compared their performance with that of a conventional approachthe Emergency Severity Index (ESI).MethodsUsing National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) ED data, from 2007 through 2015, we identified all adult patients (aged 18years). In the randomly sampled training set (70%), using routinely available triage data as predictors (e.g., demographics, triage vital signs, chief complaints, comorbidities), we developed four machine learning models: Lasso regression, random forest, gradient boosted decision tree, and deep neural network. As the reference model, we constructed a logistic regression model using the five-level ESI data. The clinical outcomes were critical care (admission to intensive care unit or in-hospital death) and hospitalization (direct hospital admission or transfer). In the test set (the remaining 30%), we measured the predictive performance, including area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and net benefit (decision curves) for each model.ResultsOf 135,470 eligible ED visits, 2.1% had critical care outcome and 16.2% had hospitalization outcome. In the critical care outcome prediction, all four machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.86 [95%CI 0.85-0.87] in the deep neural network vs 0.74 [95%CI 0.72-0.75] in the reference model), with less under-triaged patients in ESI triage levels 3 to 5 (urgent to non-urgent). Likewise, in the hospitalization outcome prediction, all machine learning models outperformed the reference model (e.g., AUC, 0.82 [95%CI 0.82-0.83] in the deep neural network vs 0.69 [95%CI 0.68-0.69] in the reference model) with less over-triages in ESI triage levels 1 to 3 (immediate to urgent). In the decision curve analysis, all machine learning models consistently achieved a greater net benefita larger number of appropriate triages considering a trade-off with over-triagesacross the range of clinical thresholds.ConclusionsCompared to the conventional approach, the machine learning models demonstrated a superior performance to predict critical care and hospitalization outcomes. The application of modern machine learning models may enhance clinicians' triage decision making, thereby achieving better clinical care and optimal resource utilization.

Accurate classification of MI is usually rather difficult to be achieved since mu rhythm is very weak and likely to be contaminated by other background noises. As an extension of the single layer feedforward network, extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently proven to be more efficient than support vector machine that is a benchmark for MI-related EEG classification. With probabilistic inference, this study introduces a sparse Bayesian ELM (SBELM)-based algorithm to improve the classification performance of MI. SBELM is able to automatically control the model complexity and exclude redundant hidden neurons by combining advantageous of both ELM and sparse Bayesian learning.

J	Abu Al-Haija, Q; Krichen, M; Abu Elhaija, W				Abu Al-Haija, Qasem; Krichen, Moez; Abu Elhaija, Wejdan			Machine-Learning-Based Darknet Traffic Detection System for IoT Applications	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						cybersecurity; machine learning; Internet of Things (IoT); IDS system; networks; darknet; blackhole; ensemble learning	INTRUSION DETECTION; INTERNET; THINGS; CHALLENGES	The massive modern technical revolution in electronics, cognitive computing, and sensing has provided critical infrastructure for the development of today's Internet of Things (IoT) for a wide range of applications. However, because endpoint devices' computing, storage, and communication capabilities are limited, IoT infrastructures are exposed to a wide range of cyber-attacks. As such, Darknet or blackholes (sinkholes) attacks are significant, and recent attack vectors that are launched against several IoT communication services. Since Darknet address space evolved as a reserved internet address space that is not contemplated to be used by legitimate hosts globally, any communication traffic is speculated to be unsolicited and distinctively deemed a probe, backscatter, or misconfiguration. Thus, in this paper, we develop, investigate, and evaluate the performance of machine-learning-based Darknet traffic detection systems (DTDS) in IoT networks. Mainly, we make use of six supervised machine-learning techniques, including bagging decision tree ensembles (BAG-DT), AdaBoost decision tree ensembles (ADA-DT), RUSBoosted decision tree ensembles (RUS-DT), optimizable decision tree (O-DT), optimizable k-nearest neighbor (O-KNN), and optimizable discriminant (O-DSC). We evaluate the implemented DTDS models on a recent and comprehensive dataset, known as the CIC-Darknet-2020 dataset, composed of contemporary actual IoT communication traffic involving four different classes that combine VPN and Tor traffic in a single dataset covering a wide range of captured cyber-attacks and hidden services provided by the Darknet. Our empirical performance analysis demonstrates that bagging ensemble techniques (BAG-DT) offer better accuracy and lower error rates than other implemented supervised learning techniques, scoring a 99.50% of classification accuracy with a low inferencing overhead of 9.09 mu second. Finally, we also contrast our BAG-DT-DTDS with other existing DTDS models and demonstrate that our best results are improved by (1.9~27%) over the former state-of-the-art models.

However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. Graphic abstract The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure-activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein-protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action.

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry.

The participating nodes in IoT networks are usually resource-constrained, which makes them luring targets for cyber attacks. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to address the security and privacy issues in IoT networks primarily through traditional cryptographic approaches. However, the unique characteristics of IoT nodes render the existing solutions insufficient to encompass the entire security spectrum of the IoT networks. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which are able to provide embedded intelligence in the IoT devices and networks, can be leveraged to cope with different security problems. In this paper, we systematically review the security requirements, attack vectors, and the current security solutions for the IoT networks. We then shed light on the gaps in these security solutions that call for ML and DL approaches. Finally, we discuss in detail the existing ML and DL solutions for addressing different security problems in IoT networks. We also discuss several future research directions for ML- and DL-based IoT security.

In order to efficiently organize, manage, maintain and optimize networking systems, more intelligence needs to be deployed. However, due to the inherently distributed feature of traditional networks, machine learning techniques are hard to be applied and deployed to control and operate networks. Software defined networking (SDN) brings us new chances to provide intelligence inside the networks. The capabilities of SDN (e.g., logically centralized control, global view of the network, software-based traffic analysis, and dynamic updating of forwarding rules) make it easier to apply machine learning techniques. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving machine learning algorithms applied to SDN. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we present an overview of machine learning algorithms. In addition, we review how machine learning algorithms are applied in the realm of SDN, from the perspective of traffic classification, routing optimization, quality of service/quality of experience prediction, resource management and security. Finally, challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.

There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.

This paper suggests a novel modelling approach using machine learning (ML) technique. The performance of five commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e. back-propagation neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) in predicting C-c is comprehensively investigated. A database with a total number of 311 datasets including three input variables, i.e. initial void ratio e(0), liquid limit water content W-L, plasticity index I-p, and one output variable C-c is first established. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the hyper-parameters in five ML algorithms, and the average prediction error for the 10-fold cross-validation (CV) sets is set as the fitness function in the GA for enhancing the robustness of ML models. The results indicate that ML models outperform empirical prediction formulations with lower prediction error. RF yields the lowest error followed by BPNN, ELM, EPR and SVM. If the ranges of input variables in the database are large enough, BPNN and RF models are recommended to predict C-c. Furthermore, if the distribution of input variables is continuous, RF model is the best one. Otherwise, EPR model is recommended if the ranges of input variables are small.

Here we apply recent techniques for explaining decisions of state-of-the-art learning machines and analyze various tasks from computer vision and arcade games. This showcases a spectrum of problem-solving behaviors ranging from naive and short-sighted, to well-informed and strategic. We observe that standard performance evaluation metrics can be oblivious to distinguishing these diverse problem solving behaviors. Furthermore, we propose our semi-automated Spectral Relevance Analysis that provides a practically effective way of characterizing and validating the behavior of nonlinear learning machines. This helps to assess whether a learned model indeed delivers reliably for the problem that it was conceived for. Furthermore, our work intends to add a voice of caution to the ongoing excitement about machine intelligence and pledges to evaluate and judge some of these recent successes in a more nuanced manner.

For this competition and toward the goal of improving sub-national and country level forecasts, we experiment with combinations of automated machine learning (autoML) systems and limited datasets that emphasize the endogenous nature of conflict. Two core findings emerge: autoML improves predictive performance and the Dynamics model performs best. The data used for the Dynamics model is limited to measures of state-based violence built from the event-level violence data plus those describing the spatial and temporal structure of the data. The intent is to capture spatial and temporal conflict dynamics while not overfitting to exogenous factors, which is especially problematic with flexible autoML algorithms and the types of highly disaggregate data used here. At the PGM level, this model won the ViEWS competition for both "predictive accuracy" and "originality." Beyond the ViEWS competition, we expect conflict forecasting models that couple advanced autoML systems with variables that reflect a diverse set of conflict dynamics to have high predictive performance, especially at sub-national and sub-annual aggregations.

The ML models have long been used in many application domains which needed the identification and prioritization of adverse factors for a threat. Several prediction methods are being popularly used to handle forecasting problems. This study demonstrates the capability of ML models to forecast the number of upcoming patients affected by COVID-19 which is presently considered as a potential threat to mankind. In particular, four standard forecasting models, such as linear regression (LR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), and exponential smoothing (ES) have been used in this study to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19. Three types of predictions are made by each of the models, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries in the next 10 days. The results produced by the study proves it a promising mechanism to use these methods for the current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results prove that the ES performs best among all the used models followed by LR and LASSO which performs well in forecasting the new confirmed cases, death rate as well as recovery rate, while SVM performs poorly in all the prediction scenarios given the available dataset.

In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of attempts so far at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.

In this study, we propose a forecasting framework that uses machine learning and internet search indexes to forecast tourist arrivals for popular destinations in China and compared its forecasting performance to the search results generated by Google and Baidu, respectively. This study verifies the Granger causality and co-integration relationship between internet search index and tourist arrivals of Beijing. Our experimental results suggest that compared with benchmark models, the proposed kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) models, which integrate tourist volume series with Baidu Index and Google Index, can improve the forecasting performance significantly in terms of both forecasting accuracy and robustness analysis.

As the cause of the disease is a novel coronavirus whose gene information is unknown, drugs and vaccines are yet to be found. For the present situation, disease spread analysis and prediction with the help of mathematical and data driven model will be of great help to initiate prevention and control action, namely lockdown and qurantine. There are various mathematical and machine-learning models proposed for analyzing the spread and prediction. Each model has its own limitations and advantages for a particluar scenario. This article reviews the state-of-the art mathematical models for COVID-19, including compartment models, statistical models and machine learning models to provide more insight, so that an appropriate model can be well adopted for the disease spread analysis. Furthermore, accurate diagnose of COVID-19 is another essential process to identify the infected person and control further spreading. As the spreading is fast, there is a need for quick auotomated diagnosis mechanism to handle large population. Deep-learning and machine-learning based diagnostic mechanism will be more appropriate for this purpose. In this aspect, a comprehensive review on the deep learning models for the diagnosis of the disease is also provided in this article.

Traditional disease categories are increasingly suspected to misrepresent the causes underlying mental disturbance. Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice.

We fabricated several alloys with hardness 10% higher than the best value in the original training dataset via only seven experiments. We find that a strategy using both the compositions and descriptors based on a knowledge of the properties of HEAs, outperforms that merely based on the compositions alone. This strategy offers a recipe to rapidly optimize multi-component systems, such as bulk metallic glasses and superalloys, towards desired properties. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

Off-the-shelf ML models, however, do not necessarily obey the fundamental governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well to scenarios on which they have not been trained. We survey systematic approaches to incorporating physics and domain knowledge into ML models and distill these approaches into broad categories. Through 10 case studies, we show how these approaches have been used successfully for emulating, downscaling, and forecasting weather and climate processes. The accomplishments of these studies include greater physical consistency, reduced training time, improved data efficiency, and better generalization. Finally we synthesize the lessons learned and identify scientific, diagnostic, computational, and resource challenges for developing truly robust and reliable physics-informed ML models for weather and climate processes. This article is part of the theme issue 'Machine learning for weather and climate modelling'.

The effective classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is the key to improving the performance of the system. To improve the classification accuracy of EEG signals in the BCI system, the transfer learning algorithm and the improved Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm are combined to construct a data classification model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified. The results show that in actual and imagined movements, the accuracy of the left- and right-hand movements at different speeds is higher than when the speeds are the same. The proposed Adaptive Composite Common Spatial Pattern (ACCSP) and Self Adaptive Common Spatial Pattern (SACSP) algorithms have good classification effects on 5 subjects, with an average classification accuracy rate of 83.58 percent, which is an increase of 6.96 percent compared with traditional algorithms. When the training sample size is 10, the classification accuracy of the ACCSP algorithm is higher than that of the traditional CSP algorithm. The improved CSP algorithm combined with transfer learning embodies a good classification effect in both ACCSP and SACSP. Especially, the performance of SACSP mode is better. Combining the improved CSP algorithm proposed with the CSP-based transfer learning algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of the BCI classifier.

In recent years, several water management issues have been addressed by means of models derived from Artificial Intelligence research. When using machine learning based models, the main challenging aspects are represented by the choice of the best possible algorithm, the choice of adequately representative variables and the availability of appropriate data sets. Machine learning algorithms may be a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration, when a time series of few years is available. Starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision. Three different evapotranspiration models have been compared in this study. The models differ in the input variables. Four variants of each model were applied, varying the machine learning algorithm: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. The data refers to an experimental site in Central Florida, characterized by humid subtropical climate. The best outcomes have been provided by Model 1, whose input variables were net solar radiation, sensible-heat flux, moisture content of the soil, wind speed, mean relative humidity and mean temperature. Model 3, built from data only of mean temperature, mean relative humidity and net solar radiation, has provided still satisfactory results. Model 2, which adds the wind speed to the input variables of Model 3, has provided results that are absolutely comparable to those of Model 3 itself.

The physical properties of concrete vary with the type of concrete, such as high and ultra-high-strength concrete, fibre-reinforced concrete, polymer-modified concrete, and lightweight concrete. The precise prediction of the properties of concrete is a problem due to the design code, which typically requires specific characteristics. The emergence of a new category of technology has motivated researchers to develop mechanical strength prediction models using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Empirical and statistical models have been extensively used. These models require a huge amount of laboratory data and still provide inaccurate results. Sometimes, these models cannot predict the properties of concrete due to complexity in the concrete mix design and curing conditions. To conquer such issues, AI models have been introduced as another approach for predicting the compressive strength and other properties of concrete. This article discusses machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian Progress Regression (GPR), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR), Ensemble Learning (EL), and optimized GPR, SVMR, and EL, to predict the compressive strength of Lightweight Concrete (LWC). The simulation approaches of these trained models indicate that AI can provide accurate prediction models without undertaking extensive laboratory trials. Each model's applicability and performance were rigorously reviewed and assessed. The findings revealed that the optimized GPR model (R = 0.9803) used in this study had the greatest accuracy. In addition, the optimized SVMR and GPR model showed good performance, with R-values 0.9777 and 0.9740, respectively. The proposed model is economic and efficient, and can be adopted by researchers and engineers to predict the compressive strength of LWC.

Prediction of droughts is immensely helpful in early warning and preparing the most vulnerable communities to their adverse impacts. For the first time, this study investigated the potential of developing drought prediction models over Pakistan using three state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques; Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). Three categories of droughts; moderate, severe, and extreme considering two major cropping seasons called Rabi and Kharif were estimated using Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) and then predicted using the predictor data obtained from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis database. Also, for the first time in drought modelling, a novel feature selection approach called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was used for identifying optimum sets of predictors. In validation, SVM-based models were able to better capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts over Pakistan compared to those by ANN and KNN-based models. KNN which was used in developing drought models for the first time displayed limited performance in comparison to that by SVM and ANN-based drought models, in validation. It was found that in the Rabi season SPEI is positively correlated with relative humidity over the Mediterranean Sea and the region north of the Caspian Sea. In the Kharif season, SPEI is positively correlated with the humid region over the south-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal and the regions north of the Mediterranean and Caspian Seas.

Due to some external or internal factors, WSN may change dynamically and therefore it requires depreciating dispensable redesign of the network. The traditional WSN approaches have been explicitly programmed which make the networks hard to respond dynamically. To overcome such scenarios, machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to react accordingly. ML is the process of self-learning from the experiences and acts without human intervention or re-program. The survey of the ML techniques for WSNs is presented in [1], covering period of 2002-2013. In this survey, we present various ML-based algorithms for WSNs with their advantages, drawbacks, and parameters effecting the network lifetime, covering the period from 2014-March 2018. In addition, we also discuss ML algorithms for synchronization, congestion control, mobile sink scheduling and energy harvesting. Finally, we present a statistical analysis of the survey, the reasons for selection of a particular ML techniques to address an issue in WSNs followed by some discussion on the open issues.

However, comparisons of the applications of ML models for LSP from the perspectives of supervised machine learning (SML) and unsupervised machine learning (USML) have not been explored. Hence, this study aims to compare the LSP performance of these SML and USML models, thus further to explore the advantages and disadvantages of these ML models and to realize a more accurate and reliable LSP result. Two representative SML models (support vector machine (SVM) and CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)) and two representative USML models (K-means and Kohonen models) are respectively used to scientifically predict the landslide susceptibility indexes, and then these prediction results are discussed. Ningdu County with 446 recorded landslides obtained through field investigations is introduced as case study. A total of 12 conditioning factors are obtained through procession of Landsat TM 8 images and high-resolution aerial images, topographical and hydrological spatial analysis of Digital Elevation Modeling in GIS software, and government reports. The area value under the curve of receiver operating features (AUC) is applied for evaluating the prediction accuracy of SML models, and the frequency ratio (FR) accuracy is then introduced to compare the remarkable prediction performance differences between SML and USML models. Overall, the receiver operation curve (ROC) results show that the AUC of the SVM is 0.892 and is slightly greater than the AUC of the CHAID model (0.872). The FR accuracy results show that the SVM model has the highest accuracy for LSP (77.80%), followed by the CHAID model (74.50%), the Kohonen model (72.8%) and the K-means model (69.7%), which indicates that the SML models can reach considerably better prediction capability than the USML models. It can be concluded that selecting recorded landslides as prior knowledge to train and test the LSP models is the key reason for the higher prediction accuracy of the SML models, while the lack of a priori knowledge and target guidance is an important reason for the low LSP accuracy of the USML models. Nevertheless, the USML models can also be used to implement LSP due to their advantages of efficient modeling processes, dimensionality reduction and strong scalability.

Extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently proven to be comparable or more efficient than support vector machine for many pattern recognition problems. In this study, we propose a multi-kernel ELM (MKELM)-based method for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. The kernel extension of ELM provides an elegant way to circumvent calculation of the hidden layer outputs and inherently encode it in a kernel matrix. We investigate effects of two different kernel functions (i.e., Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel) on the performance of kernel ELM. The MKELM method is subsequently developed by integrating these two types of kernels with a multi-kernel learning strategy, which can effectively explore the supplementary information from multiple nonlinear feature spaces for more robust classification of EEG. An extensive experimental comparison with two public EEG datasets indicates that the MKELM method gives higher classification accuracy than those of the other competing algorithms. The experimental results confirm that superiority of the proposed MKELM-based method for accurate classification of EEG associated with motor imagery in BCI applications. Our method also provides a promising and generalized solution to investigate the complex and nonlinear information for various applications in the fields of expert and intelligent systems.

Recent studies have been focused on applying machine learning methods to predict the flight delay. Most of the previous prediction methods are conducted in a single route or airport. This paper explores a broader scope of factors which may potentially influence the flight delay, and compares several machine learning-based models in designed generalized flight delay prediction tasks. To build a dataset for the proposed scheme, automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) messages are received, pre-processed, and integrated with other information such as weather condition, flight schedule, and airport information. The designed prediction tasks contain different classification tasks and a regression task. Experimental results show that long short-term memory (LSTM) is capable of handling the obtained aviation sequence data, but overfitting problem occurs in our limited dataset. Compared with the previous schemes, the proposed random forest-based model can obtain higher prediction accuracy (90.2% for the binary classification) and can overcome the overfitting problem.

The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas.ResultsIn this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors.ConclusionsThese results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.

Attack and anomaly detection in IoT sensors in IoT sites using machine learning approaches	INTERNET OF THINGS			English	Article						Internet of Things (IoT); Machine Learning; Cybersecurity; Anomaly detection		Attack and anomaly detection in the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure is a rising concern in the domain of IoT. With the increased use of IoT infrastructure in every domain, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also growing commensurately. Denial of Service, Data Type Probing, Malicious Control, Malicious Operation, Scan, Spying and Wrong Setup are such attacks and anomalies which can cause an IoT system failure. In this paper, performances of several machine learning models have been compared to predict attacks and anomalies on the IoT systems accurately. The machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been used here are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The evaluation metrics used in the comparison of performance are accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. The system obtained 99.4% test accuracy for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and ANN. Though these techniques have the same accuracy, other metrics prove that Random Forest performs comparatively better. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Hasan, Mahmudul; Islam, Md.

While these "big data" have unlocked novel opportunities to understand public health, they hold still greater potential for research and practice. This review explores several key issues that have arisen around big data. First, we propose a taxonomy of sources of big data to clarify terminology and identify threads common across some subtypes of big data. Next, we consider common public health research and practice uses for big data, including surveillance, hypothesis-generating research, and causal inference, while exploring the role that machine learning may play in each use.

These studies provide the essential material to deeply explore host-microbiome associations and their relation to the development and progression of various complex diseases. Improved data-analytical tools are needed to exploit all information from these biological datasets, taking into account the peculiarities of microbiome data, i.e., compositional, heterogeneous and sparse nature of these datasets. The possibility of predicting host-phenotypes based on taxonomy-informed feature selection to establish an association between microbiome and predict disease states is beneficial for personalized medicine. In this regard, machine learning (ML) provides new insights into the development of models that can be used to predict outputs, such as classification and prediction in microbiology, infer host phenotypes to predict diseases and use microbial communities to stratify patients by their characterization of state-specific microbial signatures. Here we review the state-of-the-art ML methods and respective software applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on the application of ML in microbiome studies related to association and clinical use for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. Although the data presented here is more related to the bacterial community, many algorithms could be applied in general, regardless of the feature type. This literature and software review covering this broad topic is aligned with the scoping review methodology. The manual identification of data sources has been complemented with: (1) automated publication search through digital libraries of the three major publishers using natural language processing (NLP) Toolkit, and (2) an automated identification of relevant software repositories on GitHub and ranking of the related research papers relying on learning to rank approach.

Machine-learning-guided directed evolution for protein engineering	NATURE METHODS			English	Review							STABILITY CHANGES; SEQUENCE; MUTATIONS; PREDICTION; KERNEL; MODEL	Protein engineering through machine-learning-guided directed evolution enables the optimization of protein functions. Machine-learning approaches predict how sequence maps to function in a data-driven manner without requiring a detailed model of the underlying physics or biological pathways. Such methods accelerate directed evolution by learning from the properties of characterized variants and using that information to select sequences that are likely to exhibit improved properties. Here we introduce the steps required to build machine-learning sequence-function models and to use those models to guide engineering, making recommendations at each stage. This review covers basic concepts relevant to the use of machine learning for protein engineering, as well as the current literature and applications of this engineering paradigm. We illustrate the process with two case studies. Finally, we look to future opportunities for machine learning to enable the discovery of unknown protein functions and uncover the relationship between protein sequence and function.

This study proposed novel integrative flood susceptibility prediction models based on multi-time resampling approaches, random subsampling (RS) and bootstrapping (BT) algorithms, integrated with machine learning models: generalized additive model (GAM), boosted regression tree (BTR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). RS and BT algorithms provided 10 runs of data resampling for learning and validation of the models. Then the mean of 10 runs of predictions is used to produce the flood susceptibility maps (BM). This methodology was applied to Ardabil Province on coastal margins of the Caspian Sea which faced destructive floods. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and true skill statistic (TSS) and correlation coefficient (COR) were utilized to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the proposed models. Results demonstrated that resampling algorithms improved the performance of Standalone GAM, MARS and BRT models. Results also revealed that Standalone models had better performance with the BT algorithm compared to the RS algorithm. BT-GAM model attained superior performance in terms of statistical measures (AUC = 0.98, TSS = 0.93, COR = 0.91), followed by BT-MARS (AUC = 0.97, TSS = 0.93, COR = 0.91) and BT-BRT model (AUC = 0.95, TSS = 0.79, COR = 0.79). Results demonstrated that the proposed models outperformed the benchmark models such as Standalone GAM, MARS, BRT, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM). Given the admirable performance of the proposed models in a large scale area, the promising results can be expected from these models for other regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With this viewpoint, the objective of this paper is to predict daily global solar radiation data of four provinces (Kirklareli, Tokat, Nevsehir and Karaman) which have different solar radiation distribution in Turkey. In the study, four different machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), kernel and nearest-neighbor (k-NN), and deep learning (DL)) are used. In the training of these algorithms, daily minimum and maximum ambient temperature, cloud cover, daily extraterrestrial solar radiation, day length and solar radiation of these provinces are used. The data is supplied from the Turkish State Meteorological Service and cover the last two years (01.01.2018-31.12.2019). To decide on the success of these algorithms, seven different statistical metrics (R-2, RMSE, rRMSE, MBE, MABE, t-stat, and MAPE) are discussed in the study. The results shows that R2, MABE, and RMSE values of all algorithms are ranging from 0.855 to 0.936, from 1.870 to 2.328 MJ/m(2), from 2.273 to 2.820 MJ/m(2), respectively. At all cases, k-NN exhibited the worst result in terms of R-2, RMSE, and MABE metrics. Of all the models, DL was the only model that exceeded the t-critic value. In conclusion, the present paper is reporting that all machine learning algorithms tested in this study can be used in the prediction of daily global solar radiation data with a high accuracy; however, the ANN algorithm is the best fitting algorithm among all algorithms. Then it is followed by DL, SVM and k-NN, respectively.

One efficient way of analyzing big data, recognizing complex patterns, and extracting trends is through machine-learning (ML) algorithms. The field of porous media, and more generally geoscience, have also witnessed much progress, and recent progress in developing various ML techniques have benefitted various problems in porous media and geoscience across disparate scales. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is imperative to adopt advanced ML methods for the problems in porous media and geoscience because they enable researchers to solve many difficult problems. At the same time, one can use the already existing extensive knowledge of porous media to endow ML algorithms and develop novel physics-guided methods. The goal of this review paper is to provide the first comprehensive review of the recently developed methods in the ML algorithms and describe their application to porous media and geoscience. Thus, we review the basic concept of the ML and describe more advanced methods, known as deep-learning algorithms. Then, the application of such methods to various problems in porous media and geoscience, such as hydrological modeling, fluid flow in porous media, and (sub)surface characterization, are reviewed. We also provide a discussion of future directions in this rapidly developing field.

The failure types, i.e., flexure, shear, or mix of the above two, will greatly affect the capacity and ductility of the structure. Meanwhile, the design methodologies for structures of different failure types will be totally different. Therefore, developing efficient and reliable methods to identify the FM and predict the corresponding capacity is of special importance for structural design/assessment management. In this paper, an intelligent approach is presented for FM classification and bearing capacity prediction of RC columns based on the ensemble machine learning techniques. The most typical ensemble learning method, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm, is adopted for both classification and regression (prediction) problems. Totally 254 cyclic loading tests of RC columns are collected. The geometric dimensions, reinforcing details, material properties are set as the input variables, while the failure types (for classification problem) and peak capacity forces (for regression problem) are set as the output variables. The results indicate that the model generated by the AdaBoost learning algorithm has a very high accuracy for both FM classification (accuracy = 0.96) and capacity prediction (R-2 = 0.98). Different learning algorithms are also compared and the results show that ensemble learning (especially AdaBoost) has better performance than single learning. In addition, the bearing capacity predicted by the AdaBoost is also compared to that by the empirical formulas provided by the design codes, which shows an obvious superior of the proposed method. In summary, the machine learning technique, especially the ensemble learning, can provide an alternate to the conventional mechanics-driven models in structural design in this big data time.

In the past decade, machine learning has gradually attracted increasing attention in solving the complex problems of organic solid waste treatment. Although significant research has been carried out, there is a lack of a systematic review of the research findings in this field. This study sorts the research studies published between 2003 and 2020, summarizes the specific application fields, characteristics, and suitability of different machine learning models, and discusses the relevant application limitations and future prospects. It can be concluded that studies mostly focused on municipal solid waste management, followed by anaerobic digestion, thermal treatment, composting, and landfill. The most widely used model is the artificial neural network, which has been successfully applied to various complicated non-linear organic solid waste related problems.

J	Zhang, JL; Shen, CQ				Zhang, Jiliang; Shen, Chaoqun			Set-Based Obfuscation for Strong PUFs Against Machine Learning Attacks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS			English	Article						Physical unclonable function; machine learning; obfuscation; authentication	AUTHENTICATION; METASTABILITY	Strong physical unclonable function (PUF) is a promising solution for device authentication in resource-constrained applications but vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In order to resist attack, many defenses have been proposed in recent years. However, these defenses incur high hardware overhead, degenerate reliability and are inefficient against advanced ML attacks such as approximation attacks. To address these issues, we propose a Random Set-based Obfuscation (RSO) for Strong PUFs to resist ML attacks. The basic idea is that several stable responses are derived from the PUF itself and pre-stored as the set for obfuscation in the testing phase, and then a true random number generator is used to select any two keys to obfuscate challenges and responses with XOR operations. When the number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) collected by the attacker exceeds the given threshold, the set will be updated immediately. In this way, ML attacks can be prevented with extremely low hardware overhead. Experimental results show that for a 64 x 64 Arbiter PUF, when the size of set is 32 and even if 1 million CRPs are collected by attackers, the prediction accuracies of the several ML attacks we use are about 50% which is equivalent to the random guessing.

BIM, machine learning and computer vision techniques in underground construction: Current status and future perspectives	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Building information modelling; Computer vision; Machine learning; Tunnelling; Underground construction	TUNNEL STRUCTURAL INSPECTION; TBM PERFORMANCE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; SYSTEM; GIS; PREDICTION; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT	The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is experiencing a technological revolution driven by booming digitisation and automation. Advances in research fields of information technology and computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM), machine learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention owing to their useful applications. At the same time, population-driven underground development has been accelerated with digital transformation as a strategic imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are valuable assets and thus demanding effective planning, construction and maintenance. While enabling greater visibility and reliability into the processes and subsystems of underground construction, applications of BIM, machine learning and computer vision in underground construction represent different sets of opportunities and challenges from their use in above-ground construction. Therefore, this paper aims to present the state-of-the-art development and future trends of BIM, machine learning, computer vision and their related technologies in facilitating the digital transition of tunnelling and underground construction. Section 1 presents the global demand for adopting these technologies. Section 2 introduces the related terminologies, standardisations and fundamentals. Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and mechanised tunnelling and highlights the importance of integrating 3D geological modelling and geographic information system (GIS) databases with BIM. Section 4 examines the key applications of machine learning and computer vision at different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses the challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and information integration throughout underground project lifecycle. Section 6 summarises the current state of development, identified gaps and future directions.	[Huang, M. Q.; Zhang, Q.

J	Wahab, OA; Mourad, A; Otrok, H; Taleb, T				Wahab, Omar Abdel; Mourad, Azzam; Otrok, Hadi; Taleb, Tarik			Federated Machine Learning: Survey, Multi-Level Classification, Desirable Criteria and Future Directions in Communication and Networking Systems	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS			English	Article						Collaborative work; Machine learning; Tutorials; Training; Servers; Data models; Cloud computing; Federated learning; federated learning tutorial; multi-level classification; statistical challenges; transfer learning; machine learning; security; communication and networking systems	INTERNET; BLOCKCHAIN; SECURITY; PRIVACY; IOT; OPTIMIZATION; COMPUTATION; ALGORITHMS; LATENCY; THINGS	The communication and networking field is hungry for machine learning decision-making solutions to replace the traditional model-driven approaches that proved to be not rich enough for seizing the ever-growing complexity and heterogeneity of the modern systems in the field. Traditional machine learning solutions assume the existence of (cloud-based) central entities that are in charge of processing the data. Nonetheless, the difficulty of accessing private data, together with the high cost of transmitting raw data to the central entity gave rise to a decentralized machine learning approach called Federated Learning. The main idea of federated learning is to perform an on-device collaborative training of a single machine learning model without having to share the raw training data with any third-party entity. Although few survey articles on federated learning already exist in the literature, the motivation of this survey stems from three essential observations. The first one is the lack of a fine-grained multi-level classification of the federated learning literature, where the existing surveys base their classification on only one criterion or aspect. The second observation is that the existing surveys focus only on some common challenges, but disregard other essential aspects such as reliable client selection, resource management and training service pricing. The third observation is the lack of explicit and straightforward directives for researchers to help them design future federated learning solutions that overcome the state-of-the-art research gaps. To address these points, we first provide a comprehensive tutorial on federated learning and its associated concepts, technologies and learning approaches. We then survey and highlight the applications and future directions of federated learning in the domain of communication and networking. Thereafter, we design a three-level classification scheme that first categorizes the federated learning literature based on the high-level challenge that they tackle. Then, we classify each high-level challenge into a set of specific low-level challenges to foster a better understanding of the topic. Finally, we provide, within each low-level challenge, a fine-grained classification based on the technique used to address this particular challenge. For each category of high-level challenges, we provide a set of desirable criteria and future research directions that are aimed to help the research community design innovative and efficient future solutions. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the most comprehensive in terms of challenges and techniques it covers and the most fine-grained in terms of the multi-level classification scheme it presents.

However, it is facing some increasing difficulties to handle the large-scale dataset generated in these forecasting applications, with the purpose of ensuring stable computing performance. In response to such limitation, this paper proposes a more practical approach through the combination of extreme-learning machine (ELM) method and deep-learning model. ELM is a novel computing paradigm that enables the neural network (NN) based learning to be achieved with fast training speed and good generalization performance. The stacked ELM (SELM) is an advanced ELM algorithm under deep-learning framework, which works efficiently on memory consumption decrease. In this paper, an enhanced SELM is accordingly developed via replacing the Euclidean norm of the mean square error (MSE) criterion in ELM with the generalized correntropy criterion to further improve the forecasting performance. The advantage of the enhanced SELM with generalized correntropy to achieve better forecasting performance mainly relies on the following aspect. Generalized correntropy is a stable and robust nonlinear similarity measure while employing machine learning method to forecast wind speed, where the outliers may exist in some industrially measured values. Specifically, the experimental results of short-term and ultra-short-term forecasting on real wind speed data show that the proposed approach can achieve better computing performance compared with other traditional and more recent methods.

Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.

Background: Dimensionality reduction is the key issue of the machine learning process. It does not only improve the prediction performance but also could recommend the intrinsic features and help to explore the biological expression of the machine learning "black box". Objective: A variety of feature selection algorithms are used to select data features to achieve dimensionality reduction. Methods: First, MRMD2.0 integrated 7 different popular feature ranking algorithms with PageRank strategy. Second, optimized dimensionality was detected with forward adding strategy. Result: We have achieved good results in our experiments. Conclusion: Several works have been tested with MRMD2.0. It showed well performance. Otherwise, it also can draw the performance curves according to the feature dimensionality. If users want to sacrifice accuracy for fewer features, they can select the dimensionality from the performance curves. Other: We developed friendly python tools together with the web server. The users could upload their csv, arff or libsvm format files. Then the webserver would help to rank features and find the optimized dimensionality.

J	Tong, H; Nikoloski, Z				Tong, Hao; Nikoloski, Zoran			Machine learning approaches for crop improvement: Leveraging phenotypic and genotypic big data	JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Genomic selection; Genomic prediction; Machine learning; Multiple traits; Multi-omics; GxE interaction	GENOMIC-ENABLED PREDICTION; ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; HYBRID PERFORMANCE; GENETIC VALUE; MULTI-TRAIT; ASSISTED PREDICTION; MOLECULAR MARKERS; R PACKAGE; SELECTION; REGRESSION	Highly efficient and accurate selection of elite genotypes can lead to dramatic shortening of the breeding cycle in major crops relevant for sustaining present demands for food, feed, and fuel. In contrast to classical approaches that emphasize the need for resource-intensive phenotyping at all stages of artificial selection, genomic selection dramatically reduces the need for phenotyping. Genomic selection relies on advances in machine learning and the availability of genotyping data to predict agronomically relevant phenotypic traits. Here we provide a systematic review of machine learning approaches applied for genomic selection of single and multiple traits in major crops in the past decade. We emphasize the need to gather data on intermediate phenotypes, e.g. metabolite, protein, and gene expression levels, along with developments of modeling techniques that can lead to further improvements of genomic selection. In addition, we provide a critical view of factors that affect genomic selection, with attention to transferability of models between different environments. Finally, we highlight the future aspects of integrating high-throughput molecular phenotypic data from omics technologies with biological networks for crop improvement.

In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive tutorial that overviews how artificial neural networks (ANNs)-based ML algorithms can be employed for solving various wireless networking problems. For this purpose, we first present a detailed overview of a number of key types of ANNs that include recurrent, spiking, and deep neural networks, that are pertinent to wireless networking applications. For each type of ANN, we present the basic architecture as well as specific examples that are particularly important and relevant wireless network design. Such ANN examples include echo state networks, liquid state machine, and long short term memory. Then, we provide an in-depth overview on the variety of wireless communication problems that can be addressed using ANNs, ranging from communication using unmanned aerial vehicles to virtual reality applications over wireless networks as well as edge computing and caching. For each individual application, we present the main motivation for using ANNs along with the associated challenges while we also provide a detailed example for a use case scenario and outline future works that can be addressed using ANNs. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first holistic tutorial on the development of ANN-based ML techniques tailored to the needs of future wireless networks.

There is a need to develop novel and efficient prediction approaches in order to avoid costly and laborious yet not-always-deterministic experiments to determine drug-target interactions (DTIs) by experiments alone. These approaches should be capable of identifying the potential DTIs in a timely manner. In this article, we describe the data required for the task of DTI prediction followed by a comprehensive catalog consisting of machine learning methods and databases, which have been proposed and utilized to predict DTIs. The advantages and disadvantages of each set of methods are also briefly discussed. Lastly, the challenges one may face in prediction of DTI using machine learning approaches are highlighted and we conclude by shedding some lights on important future research directions.

Achieving this ambitious goal requires new radio techniques for adaptive learning and intelligent decision making because of the complex heterogeneous nature of the network structures and wireless services. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have great success in supporting big data analytics, efficient parameter estimation and interactive decision making. Hence, in this article, we review the thirty-year history of ML by elaborating on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning. Furthermore, we investigate their employment in the compelling applications of wireless networks, including heterogeneous networks (HetNets), cognitive radios (CR), Internet of Things (IoT), machine to machine networks (M2M), and so on. This article aims for assisting the readers in clarifying the motivation and methodology of the various ML algorithms, so as to invoke them for hitherto unexplored services as well as scenarios of future wireless networks.

The specific development of quantum-based approaches in machine learning can now help us unravel new chemical insights. Rational design of compounds with specific properties requires understanding and fast evaluation of molecular properties throughout chemical compound space - the huge set of all potentially stable molecules. Recent advances in combining quantum-mechanical calculations with machine learning provide powerful tools for exploring wide swathes of chemical compound space. We present our perspective on this exciting and quickly developing field by discussing key advances in the development and applications of quantum-mechanics-based machine-learning methods to diverse compounds and properties, and outlining the challenges ahead. We argue that significant progress in the exploration and understanding of chemical compound space can be made through a systematic combination of rigorous physical theories, comprehensive synthetic data sets of microscopic and macroscopic properties, and modern machine-learning methods that account for physical and chemical knowledge.

Although state-of-the-art algorithms to estimate Chla in lakes from satellite-borne sensors have improved, there are no robust and reliable algorithms to generate Chla time series from OLI imageries in turbid lakes due to the absence of a red-edge band and issues with atmospheric correction. Here, a machine learning approach termed the extreme gradient boosting tree (BST) was employed to develop an algorithm for Chla estimation from OLI in turbid lakes. This model was developed and validated by linking Rayleigh-corrected reflectance to near-synchronous in situ Chla data available from eight lakes in eastern China (N = 225) and three coastal and inland waters in SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (N = 97). The BST model performed well on a subset of data (N = 102, R-2 = 0.79, root mean squared difference = 7.1 mu g L-1, mean absolute percentage error = 24%, mean absolute error = 1.4, Bias = 0.9), and had better Chla retrievals than several band-ratio algorithms and a random forest approach. The performance of BST model was judged as appropriate only for the range of conditions in the training data. Given these limitations, spatial and temporal variations of Chla in hundreds of lakes larger than 1 km(2) in eastern China for the period of 2013-2018 were mapped using the BST model. OLI-derived Chla indicated that small lakes (<50 km(2)) had greater Chla than the larger lakes. This research suggests that machine-learning models provide practical approaches to estimate Chla in turbid lakes via broadband instruments like OLI and that extending to other regions requires training with a representative dataset.Landsat-8	[Cao, Zhigang; Ma, Ronghua; Duan, Hongtao; Shen, Ming; Xue, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Cao, Zhigang; Shen, Ming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Pahlevan, Nima] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, 10210 Greenbelt Rd Suite 600, Lanham, MD 20706 USA; [Melack, John] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA		Ma, RH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, Key Lab Watershed Geog Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.	rhma@niglas.ac.cn	Pahlevan, Nima/L-7746-2014; Cao, Zhigang/L-5337-2017; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Duan, Hongtao/B-7210-2011; Cao, Zhigang/O-2165-2019	Pahlevan, Nima/0000-0002-5454-5212; Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906; Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292; Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906; Xue, Kun/0000-0003-3413-0770; ronghua, Ma/0000-0002-4485-4636	National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771366, 41671358, 41431176, 41971309]; China Scholarship Council [201904910725]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)	The authors would like to thank Robert Frouin (University of California, San Diego) for providing valuable suggestions, and Zhaoshi Wu (Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for providing some of the field data.

Yet it faces an overfitting problem. To overcome it, this work integrates bound optimization theory with variational Bayesian (VB) inference to derive novel L1 norm-based ELMs. An L1 term is attached to the squared sum cost of prediction errors to formulate an objective function. Considering the nonconvexity and nonsmoothness of the objective function, this article uses bound optimization theory, and constructs a proper surrogate function to equivalently convert a challenging L1 norm-based optimization problem into easy one. Then, VB inference is adopted for optimizing the converted problem. Thus, an L1 norm-based ELM can be efficiently optimized by an alternating optimization algorithm with a proved convergence. Finally, a soft sensor is developed based on the proposed algorithm. An industrial case study is carried out to demonstrate that the proposed soft sensor is competitive against recent ones.

A hybrid deep transfer learning model with machine learning methods for face mask detection in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						COVID-19; Masked face; Deep transfer learning; Classical machine learning		The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is causing a global health crisis. One of the effective protection methods is wearing a face mask in public areas according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In this paper, a hybrid model using deep and classical machine learning for face mask detection will be presented. The proposed model consists of two components. The first component is designed for feature extraction using Resnet50. While the second component is designed for the classification process of face masks using decision trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble algorithm. Three face masked datasets have been selected for investigation. The Three datasets are the Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD), the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD), and the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). The SVM classifier achieved 99.64% testing accuracy in RMFD. In SMFD, it achieved 99.49%, while in LFW, it achieved 100% testing accuracy.

There is currently a lot of interest in applying machine learning to find out metabolic diseases like Alzheimer's and Diabetes that affect a large population of people around the world. Their incidence rates are increasing at an alarming rate every year. In Alzheimer's disease, the brain is affected by neurodegenerative changes. As our aging population increases, more and more individuals, their families, and healthcare will experience diseases that affect memory and functioning. These effects will be profound on the social, financial, and economic fronts. In its early stages, Alzheimer's disease is hard to predict. A treatment given at an early stage of AD is more effective, and it causes fewer minor damage than a treatment done at a later stage. Several techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Voting classifiers have been employed to identify the best parameters for Alzheimer's disease prediction. Predictions of Alzheimer's disease are based on Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data, and performance is measured with parameters like Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score for ML models. The proposed classification scheme can be used by clinicians to make diagnoses of these diseases. It is highly beneficial to lower annual mortality rates of Alzheimer's disease in early diagnosis with these ML algorithms. The proposed work shows better results with the best validation average accuracy of 83% on the test data of AD. This test accuracy score is significantly higher in comparison with existing works.

Machine learning (ML), which is a subset of AI wherein machines autonomously acquire information by extracting patterns from large databases, has been increasingly used within the medical community, and specifically within the domain of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we present a brief overview of ML methodologies that are used for the construction of inferential and predictive data-driven models. We highlight several domains of ML application such as echocardiography, electrocardiography, and recently developed non-invasive imaging modalities such as coronary artery calcium scoring and coronary computed tomography angiography. We conclude by reviewing the limitations associated with contemporary application of ML algorithms within the cardiovascular disease field.

However, fully intelligent network orchestration and management for providing innovative services will only be realized in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few. Our vision for 6G is a massively connected complex network capable of rapidly responding to the users' service calls through real-time learning of the network state as described by the network edge (e.g., base-station locations and cache contents), air interface (e.g., radio spectrum and propagation channel), and the user-side (e.g., battery-life and locations). The multi-state, multi-dimensional nature of the network state, requiring the real-time knowledge, can be viewed as a quantum uncertainty problem. In this regard, the emerging paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing (QC), and quantum ML (QML) and their synergies with communication networks can be considered as core 6G enablers. Considering these potentials, starting with the 5G target services and enabling technologies, we provide a comprehensive review of the related state of the art in the domains of ML (including deep learning), QC, and QML and identify their potential benefits, issues, and use cases for their applications in the B5G networks. Subsequently, we propose a novel QC-assisted and QML-based framework for 6G communication networks while articulating its challenges and potential enabling technologies at the network infrastructure, network edge, air interface, and user end. Finally, some promising future research directions for the quantum-and QML-assisted B5G networks are identified and discussed.

ML applications in optical communications and networking are also gaining more attention, particularly in the areas of nonlinear transmission systems, optical performance monitoring, and cross-layer network optimizations for software-defined networks. However, the extent to which ML techniques can benefit optical communications and networking is not clear and this is partly due to an insufficient understanding of the nature of ML concepts. This paper aims to describe the mathematical foundations of basic ML techniques from communication theory and signal processing perspectives, which in turn will shed light on the types of problems in optical communications and networking that naturally warrant ML use. This will be followed by an overview of ongoing ML research in optical communications and networking with a focus on physical layer issues.

Results: The incidences at 6 years of CVD, CKD, DM, and HTN cases were 4.0%, 7.0%, 9.2%, and 34.6%, respectively. Logistic regression reached the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for CKD (0.905 [0.88, 0.93]) and DM (0.768 [0.73, 0.81]) predictions. For CVD and HTN, the best models were neural network (0.753 [0.70, 0.81]) and support vector machine (0.780 [0.747, 0.812]), respectively. However, the differences with logistic regression were small (less than 1%) and nonsignificant. Logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, and neural network were systematically ranked among the best models. Conclusion: Logistic regression yields as good performance as ML models to predict the risk of major chronic diseases with low incidence and simple clinical predictors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classifier for further applications of earth observations. In this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (RoC), index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the MD algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised differentiation water index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classifiers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN and RF algorithms are the best LULC classifiers, although a non-parametric classifier like SAM (Kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best machine-learning LULC classifier, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in different morphoclimatic conditions in the future.

AM also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing is layer by layer manufacturing process which can be used for fabrication of geometrically complex customized functional end-use products. Since AM processing parameters have significant effects on the performance of the printed parts, it is necessary to tune these parameters which is a difficult task. Today, different artificial intelligence techniques have been utilized to optimize AM parameters and predict mechanical behavior of 3D-printed components. In the present study, applications of machine learning (ML) in prediction of structural performance and fracture of additively manufactured components has been presented. This study first outlines an overview of ML and then summarizes its applications in AM. The main part of this review, focuses on applications of ML in prediction of mechanical behavior and fracture of 3D printed parts. To this aim, previous research works which investigated application of ML in characterization of polymeric and metallic 3D-printed parts have been reviewed and discussed. Moreover, the review and analysis indicate limitations, challenges, and perspectives for industrial applications of ML in the field of AM. Considering advantages of ML increase in applications of ML in optimization of 3D printing parameters, prediction of mechanical performance, and evaluation of 3D-printed products is expected.

Its impact is profound, and several fields have been fundamentally altered by it, autonomy and computer vision for example; reliability engineering and safety will undoubtedly follow suit. There is already a large but fragmented literature on ML for reliability and safety applications, and it can be overwhelming to navigate and integrate into a coherent whole. In this work, we facilitate this task by providing a synthesis of, and a roadmap to this ever-expanding analytical landscape and highlighting its major landmarks and pathways. We first provide an overview of the different ML categories and sub-categories or tasks, and we note several of the corresponding models and algorithms. We then look back and review the use of ML in reliability and safety applications. We examine several publications in each category/sub-category, and we include a short discussion on the use of Deep Learning to highlight its growing popularity and distinctive advantages. Finally, we look ahead and outline several promising future opportunities for leveraging ML in service of advancing reliability and safety considerations. Overall, we argue that ML is capable of providing novel insights and opportunities to solve important challenges in reliability and safety applications. It is also capable of teasing out more accurate insights from accident datasets than with traditional analysis tools, and this in turn can lead to better informed decisionmaking and more effective accident prevention.

However, its broad adoption in industry is still hindered by high entry barriers of design for additive manufacturing (DfAM), limited materials library, various processing defects, and inconsistent product quality. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has gained increasing attention in AM due to its unprecedented performance in data tasks such as classification, regression and clustering. This article provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of ML applications in a variety of AM domains. In the DfAM, ML can be leveraged to output new high-performance metamaterials and optimized topological designs. In AM processing, contemporary ML algorithms can help to optimize process parameters, and conduct examination of powder spreading and in-process defect monitoring. On the production of AM, ML is able to assist practitioners in pre-manufacturing planning, and product quality assessment and control. Moreover, there has been an increasing concern about data security in AM as data breaches could occur with the aid of ML techniques. Lastly, it concludes with a section summarizing the main findings from the literature and providing perspectives on some selected interesting applications of ML in research and development of AM.

This paper explores the predictive capacity of different approaches to LS modelling using artificial intelligence. The key objective of this study is to estimate a LS map for the Taleghan-Alamut basin of Iran using Credal Decision Tree (CDT)-based (i.e. CDT-Bagging, CDT-Multiboost and CDT-SubSpace) hybrid machine learning approaches, which are state-of-the-art soft computing approaches that are hardly ever utilized in the assessment of LS. In this study, we used eighteen landslide predisposing factors (LPFs) that we considered to be the most important local morphological and geo-environmental factors influencing the occurrence of landslides. We calculated the significance of each of the LPFs in the landslide susceptibility assessment using the Random Forest Method. We also employed the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, precision, performance, map robustness measurement and selection of the best-fitting models. The results shows that, compared to the other models, the CDT-Multiboost is the excellent model in this perspective with an average area under curve (AUC) of 0.993 based on a 4-fold cross-validation. We, therefore, consider the CDT-Multiboost models to be an effective method for improving spatial prediction of LS where landslide scarps or bodies are not clearly identified during the preparation of landslide inventory maps. Therefore, it will be helpful for preparing future landslide inventory maps and mitigate landslide damages.

In deep understanding of the operation mechanism and correlation algorithms for VSVM, each sample has increased training datasets changes and it needs to update the classifier of learning algorithm. Firstly, they are given the online growth amount of learning algorithm taken full advantage of the incremental pre-calculated information, and doesn't require retraining for the new incremental training datasets. Secondly, the incremental matrix inverse calculation process had greatly reduced the running time of algorithm, and it is given in order to verify out the validity of the online learning algorithm.

The experimental results are shown that the online learning algorithm given in the case to ensure the correct classification rates and effective training's speed. With the implementation of the incremental process, training meetings, the need for large-scale data storage space, result in slow training, the online learning algorithm based on VSVM can solve the problem.

Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.ResultsThree hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.ConclusionsOverall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field.	[Shatte, Adrian B.

J	Li, GC; Sun, YT; Qi, CC				Li, Guichen; Sun, Yuantian; Qi, Chongchong			Machine learning-based constitutive models for cement-grouted coal specimens under shearing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Constitutive law; Cement-grouted coal specimens; Machine learning; Regression tree; Ensemble learning	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; PREDICTION; TUNNEL	Cement-based grouting has been widely used in mining engineering; its constitutive law has not been comprehensively studied. In this study, a novel constitutive law of cement-grouted coal specimens (CGCS) was developed using hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms. Shear tests were performed on CGCS for the analysis of stress-strain curves and the preparation of the dataset. To maintain the interpretation of the trained ML models, regression tree (RT) was used as the main technique. The effect of maximum RT depth (Max_depth) on its performance was studied, and the hyperparameters of RT were tuned using the genetic algorithm (GA). The RT performance was also compared with ensemble learning techniques. The optimum correlation coefficient on the training set was determined as 0.835, 0.946, 0.981, and 0.985 for RT models with Max_depth = 3, 5, 7, and 9, respectively. The overall correlation coefficient was over 0.9 when the Max_depth >= 5, indicating that the constitutive law of CGCS can be well described. However, the failure type of CGCS could not be captured using the trained RT models. Random forest was found to be the optimum algorithm for the constitutive modeling of CGCS, while RT with the Max_depth = 3 performed the worst.

In this study, Longju in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China was taken as a case study for landslide susceptibility assessment in order to develop effective risk prevention and mitigation strategies. To begin, 202 landslides were identified, including 95 colluvial landslides and 107 rockfalls. Twelve landslide causal factor maps were prepared initially, and the relationship between these factors and each landslide type was analyzed using the information value model. Later, the unimportant factors were selected and eliminated using the information gain ratio technique. The landslide locations were randomly divided into two groups: 70% for training and 30% for verifying. Two machine learning models: the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), and a multivariate statistical model: the logistic regression (LR), were applied for landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM) for each type. The LSM index maps, obtained from combining the assessment results of the two landslide types, were classified into five levels. The performance of the LSMs was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics curve and Friedman test. Results show that the elimination of noise-generating factors and the separated modeling of each landslide type have significantly increased the prediction accuracy. The machine learning models outperformed the multivariate statistical model and SVM model was found ideal for the case study area.

Currently, a number of approaches have been developed for predicting incident clearance time and investigating the effects of influential factors. Statistical and machine learning methods are the two major methodological approaches. This study aims to make a methodology review for these methods by comprehensively examining their performance in incident clearance time prediction, especially, when omitted variables present significant impacts on selected variables. Specifically, we consider four widely used statistical models: Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model, Quantile Regression (QR) model, Finite Mixture (FM) model, and Random Parameters Hazard-Based Duration (RPHD) model, and four machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model, and Random Forest (RF) model as candidates. Moreover, the abilities of these methods in uncovering the underlying causality (explaining the causal effects of significant influential factors on clearance time) are also investigated. Incident clearance time data was collected on freeway road sections in Seattle, Washington State from 2009 to 2011. The conclusions can be summarized as follows: 1) the RF model and RPHD model outperform the other three models in data fitting and model prediction in their respective methodological categories; 2) three "heterogeneity" methods including RPHD, FM and QR outperform machine learning methods in model prediction as measured by MAPE; 3) machine learning methods perform stably in model prediction relative to the statistical methods; 4) incident type and lane closure type present significant effects on incident clearance time in all eight selected models.

One is that, in most industries, data exists in the form of isolated islands. The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security. We propose a possible solution to these challenges: secure federated learning. Beyond the federated-learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated-learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.

CDK2 is a protein target for the development of drugs intended to modulate cell-cycle progression and control. Such drugs have potential anticancer activities. Objective: Our goal here is to review recent applications of machine learning methods to predict ligand-binding affinity for protein targets. To assess the predictive performance of classical scoring functions and targeted scoring functions, we focused our analysis on CDK2 structures. Methods: We have experimental structural data for hundreds of binary complexes of CDK2 with different ligands, many of them with inhibition constant information. We investigate here computational methods to calculate the binding affinity of CDK2 through classical scoring functions and ma chine-learning models. Results: Analysis of the predictive performance of classical scoring functions available in docking programs such as Molegro Virtual Docker, AutoDock4, and Autodock Vina indicated that these methods failed to predict binding affinity with significant correlation with experimental data. Targeted scoring functions developed through supervised machine learning techniques showed a significant correlation with experimental data. Conclusion: Here, we described the application of supervised machine learning techniques to generate a scoring function to predict binding affinity. Machine learning models showed superior predictive performance when compared with classical scoring functions. Analysis of the computational models obtained through machine learning could capture essential structural features responsible for binding affinity against CDK2.

From a data science perspective, this paradigm shift allows extracting relevant knowledge from monitored assets through the adoption of intelligent monitoring and data fusion strategies, as well as by the application of machine learning and optimization methods. One of the main goals of data science in this context is to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in industrial machinery, tools and processes so as to anticipate critical events and damage, eventually causing important economical losses and safety issues. In this context, data-driven prognosis is gradually gaining attention in different industrial sectors. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in data fusion and machine learning for industrial prognosis, placing an emphasis on the identification of research trends, niches of opportunity and unexplored challenges. To this end, a principled categorization of the utilized feature extraction techniques and machine learning methods will be provided on the basis of its intended purpose: analyze what caused the failure (descriptive), determine when the monitored asset will fail (predictive) or decide what to do so as to minimize its impact on the industry at hand (prescriptive). This threefold analysis, along with a discussion on its hardware and software implications, intends to serve as a stepping stone for future researchers and practitioners to join the community investigating on this vibrant field.

A recent report indicates that a new malicious app for Android is introduced every 10 s. To combat this serious malware campaign, we need a scalable malware detection approach that can effectively and efficiently identify malware apps. Numerous malware detection tools have been developed, including system-level and network-level approaches. However, scaling the detection for a large bundle of apps remains a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce Significant Permission IDentification (SigPID), a malware detection system based on permission usage analysis to cope with the rapid increase in the number of Android malware. Instead of extracting and analyzing all Android permissions, we develop three levels of pruning by mining the permission data to identify the most significant permissions that can be effective in distinguishing between benign and malicious apps. SigPID then utilizes machine-learning-based classification methods to classify different families of malware and benign apps. Our evaluation finds that only 22 permissions are significant. We then compare the performance of our approach, using only 22 permissions, against a baseline approach that analyzes all permissions. The results indicate that when a support vector machine is used as the classifier, we can achieve over 90% of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-measure, which are about the same as those produced by the baseline approach while incurring the analysis times that are 4-32 times less than those of using all permissions. Compared against other state-of-the-art approaches, SigPID is more effective by detecting 93.62% of malware in the dataset and 91.4% unknown/new malware samples.

Therefore, HSPs have been regarded as the focus of drug design. Since HSPs from different families play distinct functions, accurately classifying the families of HSPs is the key step to clearly understand their biological functions. In contrast to labor-intensive and cost-ineffective experimental methods, computational classification of HSP families has emerged to be an alternative approach. Methods: We reviewed the paper that described the existing datasets of HSPs and the representative computational approaches developed for the identification and classification of HSPs. Results: The two benchmark datasets of HSPs, namely HSPIR and sHSPdb were introduced, which provided invaluable resources for computationally identifying HSPs. The gold standard dataset and sequence encoding schemes for building computational methods of classifying HSPs were also introduced. The three representative web-servers for identifying HSPs and their families were described. Conclusion: The existing machine learning methods for identifying the different families of HSPs indeed yielded quite encouraging results and did play a role in promoting the research on HSPs. However, the number of HSPs with known structures is very limited. Therefore, determining the structure of the HSPs is also urgent, which will be helpful in revealing their functions.

Supervised machine learning has gained much popularity in establishing a relationship between complex non-linear datasets. This type of machine learning algorithm has showcased its superiority over petroleum engineering regression techniques in terms of prediction errors for high dimensional data, computational power and memory. This review focuses on the most widely used machine learning algorithm employed in the petroleum industry, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with different shallow models used in reservoir characterisation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevant Vector Machine (RVM) has over the years emerged as competitive algorithms where in most cases based on this review it outperformed the ANN. This makes it preferable than the ANN when there are limited data sets. Finally, hybridisation of multiple algorithms methodologies also showed improved performance over singularly applied algorithms offering a pathway in improving reservoir characterisation based on supervised machine learning as future scope of work.

J	Zhao, XL; Yan, X; Yu, A; Van Hentenryck, P				Zhao, Xilei; Yan, Xiang; Yu, Alan; Van Hentenryck, Pascal			Prediction and behavioral analysis of travel mode choice: A comparison of machine learning and logit models	TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Machine learning; Logit models; Mobility-on-demand; Stated-preference survey; Travel mode choice; Travel behavior	DECISION TREES; CLASSIFIERS	Some recent studies have shown that machine learning can achieve higher predictive accuracy than logit models. However, existing studies rarely examine behavioral outputs (e.g., marginal effects and elasticities) that can be derived from machine-learning models and compare the results with those obtained from logit models. In other words, there has not been a comprehensive comparison between logit models and machine learning that covers both prediction and behavioral analysis, two equally important subjects in travel-behavior study. This paper addresses this gap by examining the key differences in model development, evaluation, and behavioral interpretation between logit and machine-learning models for mode-choice modeling. We empirically evaluate the two approaches using stated-preference survey data. Consistent with the literature, this paper finds that the best-performing machine-learning model, random forest, has significantly higher predictive accuracy than multi-nomial logit and mixed logit models. The random forest model and the two logit models largely agree on several aspects of the behavioral outputs, including variable importance and the direction of association between independent variables and mode choice. However, we find that the random forest model produces behaviorally unreasonable arc elasticities and marginal effects when these behavioral outputs are computed from a standard approach. After the introduction of some modifications that overcome the limitations of tree-based models, the results are improved to some extent. There appears to be a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and behavioral soundness when choosing between machine learning and logit models in mode-choice modeling.

J	Houborg, R; McCabe, MF				Houborg, Rasmus; McCabe, Matthew F.			A hybrid training approach for leaf area index estimation via Cubist and random forests machine-learning	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Machine-learning; LAI; Cubist; Random forests; Hybrid; REGFLEC	HYPERSPECTRAL VEGETATION INDEXES; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER MODELS; CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT; GREEN LAI; BIOMASS ESTIMATION; EARTH OBSERVATION; REFLECTANCE; LAND; RESOLUTION; MODIS	With an increasing volume and dimensionality of Earth observation data, enhanced integration of machine-learning methodologies is needed to effectively analyze and utilize these information rich data sets. In machine-learning, a training dataset is required to establish explicit associations between a suite of explanatory 'predictor' variables and the target property. The specifics of this learning process can significantly influence model validity and portability, with a higher generalization level expected with an increasing number of observable conditions being reflected in the training dataset. Here we propose a hybrid training approach for leaf area index (LAI) estimation, which harnesses synergistic attributes of scattered in-situ measurements and systematically distributed physically based model inversion results to enhance the information content and spatial representativeness of the training data. To do this, a complimentary training dataset of independent LAI was derived from a regularized model inversion of RapidEye surface reflectances and subsequently used to guide the development of LAI regression models via Cubist and random forests (RF) decision tree methods. The application of the hybrid training approach to a broad set of Landsat 8 vegetation index (VI) predictor variables resulted in significantly improved LAI prediction accuracies and spatial consistencies, relative to results relying on in-situ measurements alone for model training. In comparing the prediction capacity and portability of the two machine-learning algorithms, a pair of relatively simple multi-variate regression models established by Cubist performed best, with an overall relative mean absolute deviation (rMAD) of similar to 11%, determined based on a stringent scene-specific cross-validation approach. In comparison, the portability of RF regression models was less effective (i.e., an overall rMAD of similar to 15%), which was attributed partly to model saturation at high LAI in association with inherent extrapolation and transferability limitations. Explanatory VIs formed from bands in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared domains (e.g., NDWI) were associated with the highest predictive ability, whereas Cubist models relying entirely on VIs based on NIR and red band combinations (e.g., NDVI) were associated with comparatively high uncertainties (i.e., rMAD similar to 21%). The most transferable and best performing models were based on combinations of several predictor variables, which included both NDWI- and NDVI-like variables. In this process, prior screening of input VIs based on an assessment of variable relevance served as an effective mechanism for optimizing prediction accuracies from both Cubist and RF. While this study demonstrated benefit in combining data mining operations with physically based constraints via a hybrid training approach, the concept of transferability and portability warrants further investigations in order to realize the full potential of emerging machine-learning techniques for regression purposes.

This Review discusses the methodology and provides diverse examples and an outlook for further developments. Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.

Four predictive algorithms including support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), gradient boosting regressor (GBR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) are employed. The process of hyperparameter tuning is based on random search that results in trained models with better predictive performances. In addition, the missing data is handled by filling with the mean of the available data which allows more information to be used in the training process. The results on two popular datasets of compressive and tensile strengths of high performance concrete show significant improvement of the current approach in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational effort. The comparative studies reveal that, for this particular prediction problem, the trained models based on GBR and XGBoost perform better than those of SVR and MLP. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We present a theoretical framework that describes conditions under which reservoir computing can create an empirical model capable of skillful short-term forecasts and accurate long-term ergodic behavior. We illustrate this theory through numerical experiments. We also argue that the theory applies to certain other machine learning methods for time series prediction. Published by AIP Publishing.

A guide to machine learning for biologists	NATURE REVIEWS MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY			English	Review							NEURAL-NETWORK; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; SCORING FUNCTIONS; SEQUENCE; PREDICTION; DNA; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; PROTEINS; DISEASE	Machine learning is becoming a widely used tool for the analysis of biological data. However, for experimentalists, proper use of machine learning methods can be challenging. This Review provides an overview of machine learning techniques and provides guidance on their applications in biology. The expanding scale and inherent complexity of biological data have encouraged a growing use of machine learning in biology to build informative and predictive models of the underlying biological processes. All machine learning techniques fit models to data; however, the specific methods are quite varied and can at first glance seem bewildering. In this Review, we aim to provide readers with a gentle introduction to a few key machine learning techniques, including the most recently developed and widely used techniques involving deep neural networks. We describe how different techniques may be suited to specific types of biological data, and also discuss some best practices and points to consider when one is embarking on experiments involving machine learning. Some emerging directions in machine learning methodology are also discussed.

In this paper, a novel method called deep wavelet auto-encoder (DWAE) with extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. Firstly, wavelet function is employed as the nonlinear activation function to design wavelet auto-encoder (WAE), which can effectively capture the signal characteristics. Secondly, a DWAE is constructed with multiple WAEs to enhance the unsupervised feature learning ability. Finally, ELM is adopted as the classifier to accurately identify different bearing faults. The proposed method is applied to analyze the experimental bearing vibration signals, and the results confirm that the proposed method is superior to the traditional methods and standard deep learning methods.

Radio frequency (RF) fingerprint recognition technology as an important non-password authentication technology attracts more and more attention, because of its full use of radio frequency characteristics that cannot be imitated to achieve certification. In this paper, a RF fingerprint identification method based on dimensional reduction and machine learning is proposed as a component of intrusion detection for resolving authentication security issues. We compare three kinds of dimensional reduction methods, which are the traditional PCA, RPCA and KPCA. And we take random forests, support vector machine, artificial neural network and grey correlation analysis into consideration to make decisions on the dimensional reduction data. Finally, we obtain the recognition system with the best performance. Using a combination of RPCA and random forests, we achieve 90% classification accuracy is achieved at SNR10dB when reduced dimension is 76. The proposed method improves wireless device authentication and improves security protection due to the introduction of RF fingerprinting.

However, lack of explainability of complex machine learning models prevents their use in such assessment. This paper uses extensive experimental databases to suggest random forest machine learning models for failure mode predictions of reinforced concrete columns and shear walls, employs the recently developed SHapley Additive exPlanations approach to rank input variables for identification of failure modes, and explains why the machine learning model predicts a specific failure mode for a given sample or experiment. A random forest model established provides an accuracy of 84% and 86% for unknown data of columns and shear walls, respectively. The geometric variables and reinforcement indices are critical parameters that influence failure modes. The study also reveals that existing strategies of failure mode identification based solely on geometric features are not enough to properly identify failure modes.

Nondestructive crop growth monitoring based on remote sensing technologies can accurately assess crop N status, which may be used to guide the in-season site-specific N recommendations. The fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is a low-cost, easy-to-operate technology for collecting spectral reflectance imagery, an important data source for precision N management. The relationships between many vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance data and crop parameters are known to be nonlinear. As a result, nonlinear machine learning methods have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy. The objective of this study was to evaluate five different approaches for estimating rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB), plant N uptake (PNU), and N nutrition index (NNI) at stem elongation (SE) and heading (HD) stages in Northeast China: (1) single VI (SVI); (2) stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR); (3) random forest (RF); (4) support vector machine (SVM); and (5) artificial neural networks (ANN) regression. The results indicated that machine learning methods improved the NNI estimation compared to VI-SLR and SMLR methods. The RF algorithm performed the best for estimating NNI (R-2 = 0.94 (SE) and 0.96 (HD) for calibration and 0.61 (SE) and 0.79 (HD) for validation). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 0.09, and the relative errors were <10% in all the models. It is concluded that the RF machine learning regression can significantly improve the estimation of rice N status using UAV remote sensing. The application machine learning methods offers a new opportunity to better use remote sensing data for monitoring crop growth conditions and guiding precision crop management. More studies are needed to further improve these machine learning-based models by combining both remote sensing data and other related soil, weather, and management information for applications in precision N and crop management.

In the present study, hybrid machine learning approaches of Reduced Error Pruning Trees (REPT) and different ensemble techniques were used for the construction of four novel hybrid models namely Bagging based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (BREPT), MultiBoost based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (MBREPT), Rotation Forest-based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (RFREPT), Random Subspace-based Reduced Error Pruning Trees (RSREPT) for landslide susceptibility assessment and prediction. In total, ten topographical and geo-environmental landslide conditioning factors were considered for analyzing their spatial relationship with landslide occurrences. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, Statistical Indexes, and Root Mean Square Error methods were used to validate performance of these models. Analysis of model results indicate that the BREPT is the best model for landslide susceptibility assessment in comparison to other models.

J	Peng, YZ; Rysanek, A; Nagy, Z; Schluter, A				Peng, Yuzhen; Rysanek, Adam; Nagy, Zoltan; Schluter, Arno			Using machine learning techniques for occupancy-prediction-based cooling control in office buildings	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Machine learning; Occupant behavior; Building control; Smart buildings; Energy savings	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; DATA ANALYTICS; SYSTEMS	Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) are among the major energy demand in the buildings sector globally. Improving the energy efficiency of such systems is a critical objective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning towards renewable sources of energy supply. The interest of this paper is to explore means to increase the efficiency of HVAC systems in accommodating occupants' behavior in real time. For instance, rooms in office buildings are not always occupied by occupants during scheduled HVAC service periods. This offers an opportunity to reduce unnecessary energy demands of HVAC systems associated with occupants' behavior. An in-depth analysis of occupants' stochastic behavior within an office building is conducted in this paper. A demand-driven control strategy is proposed that automatically responds to occupants' energy related behavior for reducing energy consumption and maintains room temperature for occupants with similar performances as a static cooling. In this control strategy, two types of machine learning methods unsupervised and supervised learning are applied to learn occupants' behavior in two learning processes. The occupancy related information learned by the algorithms is used by a set of specified rules to infer real-time room setpoints for controlling the office's space cooling system. This learning-based approach intends to reduce the need for human intervention in the cooling system's control. The proposed strategy was applied to control the cooling system of the office building under real-world conditions.

This massive amount of raw data needs to be stored and interpreted in order to advance the materials science field. Identifying correlations and patterns from large amounts of complex data is being performed by machine learning algorithms for decades. Recently, the materials science community started to invest in these methodologies to extract knowledge and insights from the accumulated data. This review follows a logical sequence starting from density functional theory as the representative instance of electronic structure methods, to the subsequent high-throughput approach, used to generate large amounts of data. Ultimately, data-driven strategies which include data mining, screening, and machine learning techniques, employ the data generated. We show how these approaches to modern computational materials science are being used to uncover complexities and design novel materials with enhanced properties. Finally, we point to the present research problems, challenges, and potential future perspectives of this new exciting field.

Today, the availability of high-resolution EO data products is increasing exponentially, and one of the targets is to exploit this data source for the rapid generation of landslide inventory. Conventional methods like pixel-based and object-based machine learning strategies have been studied extensively in the last decade. In addition, recent advances in CNN (convolutional neural network), a type of deep-learning method, has been widely successful in extracting information from images and have outperformed other conventional learning methods. In the last few years, there have been only a few attempts to adapt CNN for landslide mapping. In this study, we introduce a modified U-Net model for semantic segmentation of landslides at a regional scale from EO data using ResNet34 blocks for feature extraction. We also compare this with conventional pixel-based and object-based methods. The experiment was done in Douglas County, a study area selected in the south of Portland in Oregon, USA, and landslide inventory extracted from SLIDO (Statewide Landslide Information Database of Oregon) was considered as the ground truth. Landslide mapping is an imbalanced learning problem with very limited availability of training data. Our network was trained on a combination of focal Tversky loss and cross-entropy loss functions using augmented image tiles sampled from a selected training area. The deep-learning method was observed to have a better performance than the conventional methods with an MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) score of 0.495 and a POD (probability of detection) rate of 0.72.

This article reviews in a selective way the recent research on the interface between machine learning and the physical sciences. This includes conceptual developments in ML motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross fertilization between the two fields. After giving a basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, examples are described of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. This review then describes applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many-body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. Research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML are also highlighted. Each of the sections describe recent successes as well as domain-specific methodology and challenges.

The present contribution discusses applications ranging from small molecule reaction dynamics to computational platforms for reaction planning. ML-based techniques can be particularly relevant for problems involving both computation and experiments. For one, Bayesian inference is a powerful approach to develop models consistent with knowledge from experiments. Second, ML-based methods can also be used to handle problems that are formally intractable using conventional approaches, such as exhaustive characterization of state-to-state information in reactive collisions. Finally, the explicit simulation of reactive networks as they occur in combustion has become possible using machine-learned neural network potentials. This review provides an overview of the questions that can and have been addressed using machine learning techniques, and an outlook discusses challenges in this diverse and stimulating field. It is concluded that ML applied to chemistry problems as practiced and conceived today has the potential to transform the way with which the field approaches problems involving chemical reactions, in both research and academic teaching.

By enabling one to generate models that learn from large datasets and make predictions on likely outcomes, machine learning can be used to study complex cellular systems such as biological networks. Here, we provide a primer on machine learning for life scientists, including an introduction to deep learning.

The respective underlying fields of basic research-quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our ` big data' world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement-exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versaresearchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating ML and AI in the quantum domain.

IoT is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. However, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to effectively secure the IoT ecosystem. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory novelty to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions.

Machine learning to classify animal species in camera trap images: Applications in ecology	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						artificial intelligence; camera trap; convolutional neural network; deep neural networks; image classification; machine learning; r package; remote sensing		Motion-activated cameras ("camera traps") are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and are amongst the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or "out-of-distribution" in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98% accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82% accuracy and correctly identified 94% of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an r package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification) that allows the users to (a) use the trained model presented here and (b) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analysing images. Our r package makes these methods accessible to ecologists.

They have also been instrumental in tackling the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19), which has been happening around the world. The SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced COVID-19 epidemic has spread rapidly across the world, leading to international outbreaks. The COVID-19 fight to curb the spread of the disease involves most states, companies, and scientific research institutions. In this research, we look at the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based ML and DL methods for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, in the battle against COVID-19, we summarize the AI-based ML and DL methods and the available datasets, tools, and performance. This survey offers a detailed overview of the existing state-of-the-art methodologies for ML and DL researchers and the wider health community with descriptions of how ML and DL and data can improve the status of COVID-19, and more studies in order to avoid the outbreak of COVID-19. Details of challenges and future directions are also provided.

COVID-19 Aachen Study COVAS; Deutsch COVID-19 Omics Initiative	Swarm Learning for decentralized and confidential clinical machine learning	NATURE			English	Article							PRIVACY; CLASSIFICATION; CLOUD	Fast and reliable detection of patients with severe and heterogeneous illnesses is a major goal of precision medicine(1,2). Patients with leukaemia can be identified using machine learning on the basis of their blood transcriptomes(3). However, there is an increasing divide between what is technically possible and what is allowed, because of privacy legislation(4,5). Here, to facilitate the integration of any medical data from any data owner worldwide without violating privacy laws, we introduce Swarm Learning-a decentralized machine-learning approach that unites edge computing, blockchain-based peer-to-peer networking and coordination while maintaining confidentiality without the need for a central coordinator, thereby going beyond federated learning. To illustrate the feasibility of using Swarm Learning to develop disease classifiers using distributed data, we chose four use cases of heterogeneous diseases (COVID-19, tuberculosis, leukaemia and lung pathologies). With more than 16,400 blood transcriptomes derived from 127 clinical studies with non-uniform distributions of cases and controls and substantial study biases, as well as more than 95,000 chest X-ray images, we show that Swarm Learning classifiers outperform those developed at individual sites. In addition, Swarm Learning completely fulfils local confidentiality regulations by design. We believe that this approach will notably accelerate the introduction of precision medicine.

Toward systematic review automation: a practical guide to using machine learning tools in research synthesis	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Machine learning; Natural language processing; Evidence synthesis		Technologies and methods to speed up the production of systematic reviews by reducing the manual labour involved have recently emerged. Automation has been proposed or used to expedite most steps of the systematic review process, including search, screening, and data extraction. However, how these technologies work in practice and when (and when not) to use them is often not clear to practitioners. In this practical guide, we provide an overview of current machine learning methods that have been proposed to expedite evidence synthesis. We also offer guidance on which of these are ready for use, their strengths and weaknesses, and how a systematic review team might go about using them in practice.

J	Liu, B				Liu, Bin			BioSeq-Analysis: a platform for DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis based on machine learning approaches	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						biological sequence analysis; machine learning; feature extraction; predictor construction; performance evaluation	COMBINING EVOLUTIONARY INFORMATION; REMOTE HOMOLOGY DETECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; FLEXIBLE WEB SERVER; K-TUPLE; ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER; SITE PREDICTION; MODES; IDENTIFICATION	With the avalanche of biological sequences generated in the post-genomic age, one of the most challenging problems is how to computationally analyze their structures and functions. Machine learning techniques are playing key roles in this field. Typically, predictors based on machine learning techniques contain three main steps: feature extraction, predictor construction and performance evaluation. Although several Web servers and stand-alone tools have been developed to facilitate the biological sequence analysis, they only focus on individual step. In this regard, in this study a powerful Web server called BioSeq-Analysis (http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/) has been proposed to automatically complete the three main steps for constructing a predictor. The user only needs to upload the benchmark data set. BioSeq-Analysis can generate the optimized predictor based on the benchmark data set, and the performance measures can be reported as well. Furthermore, to maximize user's convenience, its stand-alone program was also released, which can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/download/, and can be directly run on Windows, Linux and UNIX. Applied to three sequence analysis tasks, experimental results showed that the predictors generated by BioSeq-Analysis even outperformed some state-of-the-art methods. It is anticipated that BioSeq-Analysis will become a useful tool for biological sequence analysis.

The first type tended to be analytical methods, such as filtered backprojection (FBP) for X-ray computed tomography (CT) and the inverse Fourier transform for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), based on simple mathematical models for the imaging systems. These methods are typically fast, but have suboptimal properties such as poor resolution-noise tradeoff for CT. A second type is iterative reconstruction methods based on more complete models for the imaging system physics and, where appropriate, models for the sensor statistics. These iterative methods improved image quality by reducing noise and artifacts. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved methods among these have been based on relatively simple regularization models. A third type of methods has been designed to accommodate modified data acquisition methods, such as reduced sampling in MRI and CT to reduce scan time or radiation dose. These methods typically involve mathematical image models involving assumptions such as sparsity or low rank. A fourth type of methods replaces mathematically designed models of signals and systems with data-driven or adaptive models inspired by the field of machine learning. This article focuses on the two most recent trends in medical image reconstruction: methods based on sparsity or low-rank models and data-driven methods based on machine learning techniques.

Currently, deep structures with automatic feature learning, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), have achieved great performances for the RUL prediction. However, the conventional LSTM network only uses the learned features at last time step for regression or classification, which is not efficient. Besides, some handcrafted features with domain knowledge may convey additional information for the prediction of RUL. It is thus highly motivated to integrate both those handcrafted features and automatically learned features for the RUL prediction. In this article, we propose an attention-based deep learning framework for machine's RUL prediction. The LSTM network is employed to learn sequential features from raw sensory data. Meanwhile, the proposed attention mechanism is able to learn the importance of features and time steps, and assign larger weights to more important ones. Moreover, a feature fusion framework is developed to combine the handcrafted features with automatically learned features to boost the performance of the RUL prediction. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real datasets and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

This study plans to compare the prediction performance of these data-driven models on the landslide susceptibility mapping, thus further to explore the inherently features of these data-driven models. As a result, a more accurate and reliable LSP can be realized through choosing an optimal data-based model. A heuristic model represented by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a general statistical model represented by the general linear model (GLM) and information value (IV) model, and machine learning models represented by binary logistic regression (BLR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and C5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT) are adopted in this study. Shicheng County in China is used as the study area. In total, 369 landslides identified through field investigation are classified as training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Next, 13 landslide conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, relief amplitude, total surface radiation, population density, Normalized difference vegetation index, distance to river, topographic wetness index and rock types) are acquired from data sources of the free remote sensing images, Digital Elevation Model, field investigation and government reports. The correlations between these conditioning factors and the landslide locations are determined by frequency ratio analysis. Then, the landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) calculated by the eight trained models are imported into GIS software to produce landslide susceptibility maps of Shicheng County. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the calculated LSIs are applied to assess the LSP performance of the present eight models. The testing results show that these eight models generate reasonable LSP results as a whole, further showing that the C5.0 DT is of the highest prediction accuracy with an AUC value of 0.868, followed by the SVM (0.813), BPNN (0.803), MLP (0.792), BLR (0.784), GLM (0.779), IV (0.774) and AHP (0.773). It can be inferred that the machine learning models have higher LSP performance than general statistical and heuristic models due to its high AUC accuracy and reasonable LSIs distribution features, while general statistical model is limited by its linear analysis and heuristic model is limited by subjective weighting process.

A machine-learning fatigue life prediction approach of additively manufactured metals	ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS			English	Article						Machine learning method; Laser powder bed fusion; Synchrotron X-ray computed tomography; Fatigue life; Ti-6Al-4V alloy		The defects retained during laser powder bed fusion determine the poor fatigue performance and pronounced lifetime scatter of the fabricated metallic components. In this work, a machine learning method was adopted to explore the influence of defect location, size, and morphology on the fatigue life of a selective laser melted Ti-6Al-4 V alloy. Both the high cycle fatigue post mortem examination and synchrotron X-ray tomography were combined to acquire the geometric features of the critical defects, which were trained using a support vector machine (SVM). To accelerate the optimization process, the grid search approach with cross validation was selected for fitting the model parameters. It is found that the coefficient of determination between the predicted and experimental fatigue lives can reach up to 0.99, indicating that the SVM model shows strong training ability.

Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Training; Data models; Servers; Deep learning; Protocols; Training data; Distributed databases; Deep learning; distributed learning; efficient communication; federated learning; privacy-preserving machine learning		Federated learning allows multiple parties to jointly train a deep learning model on their combined data, without any of the participants having to reveal their local data to a centralized server. This form of privacy-preserving collaborative learning, however, comes at the cost of a significant communication overhead during training. To address this problem, several compression methods have been proposed in the distributed training literature that can reduce the amount of required communication by up to three orders of magnitude. These existing methods, however, are only of limited utility in the federated learning setting, as they either only compress the upstream communication from the clients to the server (leaving the downstream communication uncompressed) or only perform well under idealized conditions, such as i.i.d. distribution of the client data, which typically cannot be found in federated learning. In this article, we propose sparse ternary compression (STC), a new compression framework that is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the federated learning environment. STC extends the existing compression technique of top-k gradient sparsification with a novel mechanism to enable downstream compression as well as ternarization and optimal Golomb encoding of the weight updates. Our experiments on four different learning tasks demonstrate that STC distinctively outperforms federated averaging in common federated learning scenarios. These results advocate for a paradigm shift in federated optimization toward high-frequency low-bitwidth communication, in particular in the bandwidth-constrained learning environments.

This approach employs the adaptive boosting algorithm to construct a strong learner by integrating several weak learners, which can find the mapping between the input data and output data. The weak learner whose predicting error is small will have a larger weight in the entire system, thus the overall accuracy of the strong learner will be enhanced. A total of 1030 sets of concrete compressive strength tests is collected to train and test the learners, in which the concrete mixture components (e.g., coarse/fine aggregates, cement, water, additive, etc.) and the curing time are set as the input data while the compressive strength value is set as the output data. The proposed approach is validated through a 10-fold cross validation method, and reaches an average accuracy of over 95% in sense of determination coefficient. In addition, a new dataset of 103 samples for concrete compressive strength is also adopted to demonstrate the generalization power of the proposed mode. The proposed approach is also compared to some other individual machine learning techniques that are already applied in this field, e.g., artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), and shows superior advantages over these methods. Finally, the influence of some key factors in the adaptive boosting approach is also investigated, e.g., the amount of training data, the choice of weak learner, and the influence of the sensitivity and number of the input parameters. It is shown that using 80% of the total data for training can obtain acceptable prediction results and decision tree is the best choice for the weak learner in the boosting framework. Also, the importances of different input variables are obtained based on the sensitivity analysis results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Major challenges such as overpopulation, competition for resources poses a threat to the food security of the planet. In order to tackle the ever-increasing complex problems in agricultural production systems, advancements in smart farming and precision agriculture offers important tools to address agricultural sustainability challenges. Data analytics hold the key to ensure future food security, food safety, and ecological sustainability. Disruptive information and communication technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, and blockchain can address several problems such as productivity and yield improvement, water conservation, ensuring soil and plant health, and enhance environmental stewardship. The current study presents a systematic review of machine learning (ML) applications in agricultural supply chains (ASCs). Ninety three research papers were reviewed based on the applications of different ML algorithms in different phases of the ASCs. The study highlights how ASCs can benefit from ML techniques and lead to ASC sustainability. Based on the study findings an ML applications framework for sustainable ASC is proposed. The framework identifies the role of ML algorithms in providing real-time analytic insights for pro-active data-driven decision-making in the ASCs and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of ASCs for improved agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Power of data in quantum machine learning	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SUPREMACY	The use of quantum computing for machine learning is among the most exciting prospective applications of quantum technologies. However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits. Expectations for quantum machine learning are high, but there is currently a lack of rigorous results on which scenarios would actually exhibit a quantum advantage. Here, the authors show how to tell, for a given dataset, whether a quantum model would give any prediction advantage over a classical one.

They are responsible for substantial damages and losses in those areas. The A1 Highway, which is an important road in Algeria, was sometimes constructed in mountainous and/or semi-mountainous areas. Previous studies of landslide susceptibility mapping conducted near this road using statistical and expert methods have yielded ordinary results. In this research, we are interested in how do machine learning techniques help in increasing accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps in the vicinity of the A1 Highway corridor. To do this, an important section at Ain Bouziane (NE, Algeria) is chosen as a case study to evaluate the landslide susceptibility using three different machine learning methods, namely, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and boosted regression tree (BRT). First, an inventory map and nine input factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) analyses. The three models were constructed to find the most susceptible areas to this phenomenon. The results were assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the standard error (Std. error), and the confidence interval (CI) at 95%. The RF model reached the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 97.2%) comparatively to the other models. The outcomes of this research proved that the obtained machine learning models had the ability to predict future landslide locations in this important road section. In addition, their application gives an improvement of the accuracy of LSMs near the road corridor. The machine learning models may become an important prediction tool that will identify landslide alleviation actions.

The aim of this study is to assess landslide susceptibility by integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with three conventional machine learning classifiers of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR) in the case of Yongxin Country, China. To this end, 16 predisposing factors were first selected for landslide modelling. Then, a total of 364 landslide historical locations were randomly divided into training (70%; 255) and verification (30%; 109) sets for modelling process and assessment. Next, the training set was used for building three hybrid methods of CNN-SVM, CNN-RF and CNN-LR. In the following, the trained models were used for landslide susceptibility mapping. Finally, several objective measures were employed to compare and validate the performance of these methods. The experimental results demonstrated that the performance of the machine learning classifiers previously mentioned can be effectively improved by integrating the CNN technique. Therefore, the proposed hybrid methods can be recommended for landslide spatial modelling in other prone areas with similar geo-environmental conditions.

Some of the literatures pointed out that the pandemic is exhibiting seasonal patterns in its spread, incidence and nature of the distribution. In connection to the spread and distribution of the infection, scientific analysis that answers the questions whether the next summer can save people from COVID-19 is required. Many researchers have been exclusively asked whether high temperature during summer can slow down the spread of the COVID-19 as it has with other seasonal flues. Since there are a lot of questions that are unanswered right now, and many mysteries aspects about the COVID-19 that is still unknown to us, in-depth study and analysis of associated weather features are required. Moreover, understanding the nature of COVID-19 and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 request more investigation of the real effect of weather variables on the transmission of the COVID-19 among people. In this work, various regressor machine learning models are proposed to extract the relationship between different factors and the spreading rate of COVID-19. The machine learning algorithms employed in this work estimate the impact of weather variables such as temperature and humidity on the transmission of COVID-19 by extracting the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the weather variables on certain regions. To validate the proposed method, we have collected the required datasets related to weather and census features and necessary prepossessing is carried out. From the experimental results, it is shown that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the mortality rate when compared to the other census variables such as population, age, and urbanization. Thus, from this result, we can conclude that temperature and humidity are important features for predicting COVID-19 mortality rate. Moreover, it is indicated that the higher the value of temperature the lower number of infection cases. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This setting also allows the training data decentralized to ensure the data privacy of each device. Federated learning adheres to two major ideas: local computing and model transmission, which reduces some systematic privacy risks and costs brought by traditional centralized machine learning methods. The original data of the client is stored locally and cannot be exchanged or migrated. With the application of federated learning, each device uses local data for local training, then uploads the model to the server for aggregation, and finally the server sends the model update to the participants to achieve the learning goal. To provide a comprehensive survey and facilitate the potential research of this area, we systematically introduce the existing works of federated learning from five aspects: data partitioning, privacy mechanism, machine learning model, communication architecture and systems heterogeneity. Then, we sort out the current challenges and future research directions of federated learning. Finally, we summarize the characteristics of existing federated learning, and analyze the current practical application of federated learning. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reliable Industry 4.0 Based on Machine Learning and IoT for Analyzing, Monitoring, and Securing Smart Meters	SENSORS			English	Article						smart systems; industry 4; 0; internet of things; machine learning		The modern control infrastructure that manages and monitors the communication between the smart machines represents the most effective way to increase the efficiency of the industrial environment, such as smart grids. The cyber-physical systems utilize the embedded software and internet to connect and control the smart machines that are addressed by the internet of things (IoT). These cyber-physical systems are the basis of the fourth industrial revolution which is indexed by industry 4.0. In particular, industry 4.0 relies heavily on the IoT and smart sensors such as smart energy meters. The reliability and security represent the main challenges that face the industry 4.0 implementation. This paper introduces a new infrastructure based on machine learning to analyze and monitor the output data of the smart meters to investigate if this data is real data or fake. The fake data are due to the hacking and the inefficient meters. The industrial environment affects the efficiency of the meters by temperature, humidity, and noise signals. Furthermore, the proposed infrastructure validates the amount of data loss via communication channels and the internet connection. The decision tree is utilized as an effective machine learning algorithm to carry out both regression and classification for the meters' data. The data monitoring is carried based on the industrial digital twins' platform. The proposed infrastructure results provide a reliable and effective industrial decision that enhances the investments in industry 4.0.

Coupling machine learning algorithms with spatial data types for landslide susceptibility mapping is a vitally important issue. This study was carried out using GIS and R open source software at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia. First, a total of 243 landslide locations were identified at Abha Basin to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data sources. All the landslide areas were randomly separated into two groups with a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validating purposes. Twelve landslide-variables were generated for landslide susceptibility modeling, which include altitude, lithology, distance to faults, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse/landcover (LULC), distance to roads, slope angle, distance to streams, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope length (LS), and slope-aspect. The area under curve (AUC-ROC) approach has been applied to evaluate, validate, and compare the MLTs performance. The results indicated that AUC values for seven MLTs range from 89.0% for QDA to 95.1% for RF. Our findings showed that the RF (AUC = 95.1%) and LDA (AUC = 941.7%) have produced the best performances in comparison to other MLTs. The outcome of this study and the landslide susceptibility maps would be useful for environmental protection.

The study conceptualizes blockchain technology as a dynamic capability that should be possessed by the organization to remain competitive. The factors influencing the blockchain adoption behavior were modeled using the theoretical lens of the Technology Acceptance Model and Technology-organisation-Environment framework. The findings identify competitor pressure, partner readiness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use as the most influencing factors for blockchain adoption. A predictive decision support system was developed using a Bayesian network analysis featuring the significant factors that can be used by the decision-makers for predicting the probability of blockchain adoption in their organization. The prior probability values reported in the study may be used as indicators by the practitioners to predict their blockchain adoption probability. The practitioner will be required to substitute these probability values (high or low), as applicable to their organization to estimate the adoption probability. The use of the decision support system is likely to help the decision-makers to assess their adoption probability and develop future adoption strategies.

However, the accuracy of the existing CAD systems remains unsatisfactory. This paper explores a breast CAD method based on feature fusion with convolutional neural network (CNN) deep features. First, we propose a mass detection method based on CNN deep features and unsupervised extreme learning machine (ELM) clustering. Second, we build a feature set fusing deep features, morphological features, texture features, and density features. Third, an ELM classifier is developed using the fused feature set to classify benign and malignant breast masses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed mass detection and breast cancer classification method.

Physics-based prediction models of building thermal load are constrained by the model and input complexity. In this study, we developed 12 data-driven models (7 shallow learning, 2 deep learning, and 3 heuristic methods) to predict building thermal load and compared shallow machine learning and deep learning. The 12 prediction models were compared with the measured cooling demand. It was found XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boost) and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) provided the most accurate load prediction in the shallow and deep learning category, and both outperformed the best baseline model, which uses the previous day's data for prediction. Then, we discussed how the prediction horizon and input uncertainty would influence the load prediction accuracy. Major conclusions are twofold: first, LSTM performs well in short-term prediction (1 h ahead) but not in long term prediction (24 h ahead), because the sequential information becomes less relevant and accordingly not so useful when the prediction horizon is long. Second, the presence of weather forecast uncertainty deteriorates XGBoost's accuracy and favors LSTM, because the sequential information makes the model more robust to input uncertainty. Training the model with the uncertain rather than accurate weather data could enhance the model's robustness. Our findings have two implications for practice. First, LSTM is recommended for short-term load prediction given that weather forecast uncertainty is unavoidable. Second, XGBoost is recommended for long term prediction, and the model should be trained with the presence of input uncertainty.

However, no study has used machine learning to estimate historical concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) at daily time scale in China at a national level. Objectives: To estimate daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China during 2005-2016. Methods: Daily ground-level PM2.5 data were obtained from 1479 stations across China during 2014-2016. Data on aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological conditions and other predictors were downloaded. A random forests model (non-parametric machine learning algorithms) and two traditional regression models were developed to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The best-fit model was then utilized to estimate the daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China with a resolution of 0.1 degrees (approximate to 10 km) during 2005-2016. Results: The daily random forests model showed much higher predictive accuracy than the other two traditional regression models, explaining the majority of spatial variability in daily PM2.5 [10-fold cross-validation (CV) R-2 = 83%, root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) = 28.1 mu g/m(3)]. At the monthly and annual time-scale, the explained variability of average PM2.5 increased up to 86% (RMSE = 10.7 mu g/m(3) and 6.9 mu g/m(3), respectively). Conclusions: Taking advantage of a novel application of modeling framework and the most recent ground-level PM2.5 observations, the machine learning method showed higher predictive ability than previous studies. Capsule: Random forests approach can be used to estimate historical exposure to PM2.5 in China with high accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among different application scenarios that the upcoming 5G and beyond cellular networks are expected to support, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTCs), and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLCs), the mMTC brings the unique technical challenge of supporting a huge number of MTC devices in cellular networks, which is the main focus of this paper. The related challenges include quality of service (QoS) provisioning, handling highly dynamic and sporadic MTC traffic, huge signalling overhead, and radio access network (RAN) congestion. In this regard, this paper aims to identify and analyze the involved technical issues, to review recent advances, to highlight potential solutions and to propose new research directions. First, starting with an overview of mMTC features and QoS provisioning issues, we present the key enablers for mMTC in cellular networks. Along with the highlights on the inefficiency of the legacy random access (RA) procedure in the mMTC scenario, we then present the key features and channel access mechanisms in the emerging cellular IoT standards, namely, LTE-M and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). Subsequently, we present a framework for the performance analysis of transmission scheduling with the QoS support along with the issues involved in short data packet transmission. Next, we provide a detailed overview of the existing and emerging solutions toward addressing RAN congestion problem, and then identify potential advantages, challenges, and use cases for the applications of emerging machine learning (ML) techniques in ultra-dense cellular networks. Out of several ML techniques, we focus on the application of low-complexity $Q$ -learning approach in the mMTC scenario along with the recent advances toward enhancing its learning performance and convergence. Finally, we discuss some open research challenges and promising future research directions.

A novel multi-modal machine learning based approach for automatic classification of EEG recordings in dementia	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Machine learning; Continuous wavelet transform; Bispectrum; Alzheimer's disease; Mild cognitive impairment; Data fusion	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; DYNAMICS	Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings generate an electrical map of the human brain that are useful for clinical inspection of patients and in biomedical smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) and BrainComputer Interface (BCI) applications. From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected into the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from delta, theta, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multimodal (CWT+BiS) features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently, our proposed multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable alternative to state-of-the-art computationally intensive deep learning approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1 similar to 2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R-2 > 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available. Our findings highlight a potentially powerful tool to predict yield using multiple-source data and machine learning in other regions and for crops.

The recent pandemic exposes the shortcomings of traditional healthcare system, i.e., hospitals and clinics alone are not capable to cope with this situation. One of the major technology that aids contemporary healthcare solutions is the smart and connected wearables. The advancement in Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled these wearables to collect data on an unprecedented scale. These wearables gather context-oriented information related to our physical, behavioural and psychological health. The big data generated by wearables and other healthcare devices of IoT is a challenging task to manage that can negatively affect the inference process at the decision centres. Applying big data analytics for mining information, extracting knowledge and making predictions/inferences has recently attracted significant attention. Machine learning is another area of research that has successfully been applied to solve various networking problems such as routing, traffic engineering, resource allocation, and security. Recently, we have seen a surge in the application of ML-based techniques for the improvement of various IoT applications. Although, big data analytics and machine learning are extensively researched, there is a lack of study that exclusively focus on the evolution of ML-based techniques for big data analysis in the IoT healthcare sector. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the application of machine learning techniques for big data analysis in the healthcare sector. Furthermore, strength and weaknesses of existing techniques along with various research challenges are highlighted. Our study will provide an insight for healthcare practitioners and government agencies to keep themselves well-equipped with the latest trends in ML-based big data analytics for smart healthcare.

One of the key objectives in healthcare is the early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps, challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future directions.

J	Luo, B; Wang, HT; Liu, HQ; Li, B; Peng, FY				Luo, Bo; Wang, Haoting; Liu, Hongqi; Li, Bin; Peng, Fangyu			Early Fault Detection of Machine Tools Based on Deep Learning and Dynamic Identification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool; deep learning; dynamic identification; fault diagnosis; feature extraction	ROTATING MACHINERY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; SIGNAL; FEATURES	In modern digital manufacturing, nearly 79.6% of the downtime of a machine tool is caused by its mechanical failures. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a useful way to minimize the machine downtime and the associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is early fault detection under time-varying operational conditions, which means mining sensitive fault features from condition signals in long-term running. However, fault features are often weakened and disturbed by the time-varying harmonics and noise during a machining process. Existing analysis methods of these complex and diverse data are inefficient and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel method for early fault detection under time-varying conditions. In this study, a deep learning model is constructed to automatically select the impulse responses from the vibration signals in long-term running of 288 days. Then, dynamic properties are identified from the selected impulse responses to detect the early mechanical fault under time-varying conditions. Compared to traditional methods, the experimental results in this paper have proved that our method was not affected by time-varying conditions and showed considerable potential for early fault detection in manufacturing.

The summarization of potential risks during excavation provides an important index for establishing an early warning system. The applications of fuzzy set theory and machine learning methods in risk assessment during excavation are presented. A case study of excavation in Guangzhou metro station is used to demonstrate the application of a machine learning method for risk evaluation. The large amount of data collected by 3S techniques (RS, GIS and GPS) and sensors increases accuracy of risk assessment levels in excavation. These procedures, integrated into building information modelling (BIM) management platform, can manipulate dynamic safety risk monitoring, control, and management. Finally, the processing and analysis of big data obtained from 3S techniques and sensors provide promising perspectives for establishing integrated technology system for excavation.

However, with the rapid growth of vehicles, the vehicular network becomes heterogeneous, dynamic, and large scaled, which makes it difficult to meet the strict requirements, such as ultralow latency, high reliability, high security, and massive connections of the next-generation (6G) network. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technique to make both the vehicle and wireless communication highly efficient and adaptable. Naturally, employing ML into vehicular communication and network becomes a hot topic and is being widely studied in both academia and industry, paving the way for the future intelligentization in 6G vehicular networks. In this article, we provide a survey on various ML techniques applied to communication, networking, and security parts in vehicular networks and envision the ways of enabling AI toward a future 6G vehicular network, including the evolution of intelligent radio (IR), network intelligentization, and self-learning with proactive exploration.

J	Chen, ZY; Gryllias, K; Li, WH				Chen, Zhuyun; Gryllias, Konstantinos; Li, Weihua			Mechanical fault diagnosis using Convolutional Neural Networks and Extreme Learning Machine	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Convolutional Neural Network; Extreme Learning Machine; Wavelet Transform	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; AUTO-ENCODER	In the era of the so called 4th industrial revolution, the Factory of the Future and the Industrial Internet of Things, the industrial mechanical systems become continuously more intelligent and more complex. Therefore, there is a clear need for research and development on data driven methodologies and condition monitoring techniques which are able to achieve fast, reliable and high-quality diagnosis in an automatic manner. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis approach integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed, consisting of three main stages. Firstly, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is employed in order to obtain pre-processed representations of raw vibration signals. Secondly, a CNN with a square pooling architecture is constructed to extract high-level features. The model does not require extra training and fine-tuning, which can effectively reduce computational cost. Finally, ELM as a strong classifier is further utilized to improve the classification performance on the diagnosis framework. Two datasets, including a gearbox dataset and a motor bearing dataset, have been collected and used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comprehensive comparison and analysis with widely used algorithms is also performed. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect different fault types and outperforms other methods in terms of classification accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sullivan, E				Sullivan, Emily			Understanding from Machine Learning Models	BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article							RESIDENTIAL PREFERENCES; SEXUAL ORIENTATION; VALUES; SEGREGATION	Simple idealized models seem to provide more understanding than opaque, complex, and hyper-realistic models. However, an increasing number of scientists are going in the opposite direction by utilizing opaque machine learning models to make predictions and draw inferences, suggesting that scientists are opting for models that have less potential for understanding. Are scientists trading understanding for some other epistemic or pragmatic good when they choose a machine learning model? Or are the assumptions behind why minimal models provide understanding misguided? In this article, using the case of deep neural networks, I argue that it is not the complexity or black box nature of a model that limits how much understanding the model provides. Instead, it is a lack of scientific and empirical evidence supporting the link that connects a model to the target phenomenon that primarily prohibits understanding.

In this study, we propose and validate a new soft computing approach that is an integration of an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), named as PSO-ELM, for the spatial prediction of flash floods. The ELM is used to generate the initial flood model, whereas the PSO was employed to optimize the model. A high frequency tropical typhoon area at Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case study. In this regard, a geospatial database for the study area was constructed with 654 flash flood locations and 12 influencing factors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, toposhade, topographic wetness index, stream power index, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall). The model performance was validated using several evaluators such as kappa statistics, root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) and compared to three state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, including multilayer perceptron neural networks, support vector machine, and C4.5 decision tree. The results revealed that the PSO-ELM model has high prediction performance (kappa statistics = 0.801, RMSE = 0.281; MAE = 0.079, R-2 = 0.829, AUC-ROC = 0.954) and successfully outperformed the three machine learning models. We conclude that the proposed model is a new tool for the prediction of flash flood susceptibility at high frequency tropical typhoon areas.

In this study, integrating the publicly available data (i.e., satellite vegetation indexes, meteorological indexes, and soil properties) within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we developed one Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, one machine learning (Random Forest, RF), and one deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory Networks, LSTM) model to predict rice yield at county-level across China. For satellite data, we compared the contiguous solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a newly emerging satellite retrieval, with a traditional vegetation index (enhanced vegetation index, EVI). The results showed that LSTM (with R-2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.87, RMSE from 298.11 to 724kg/ha) and RF (with R-2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.82, RMSE from 366 to 723.3 kg/ha) models outperformed LASSO (with R-2 ranging from 0.33 to 0.42, RMSE from 633.46 kg/ha to 1231.39 kg/ha) in yield prediction; and LSTM was better than RF. Besides, ESI (combining EVI and SIF together) could slightly improve the model performance compared with only using EVI or SIF as the single input, primarily due to the ability of satellite-based SIF in capturing extra information on drought and heat stress. Furthermore, we also explored the potential for timely rice yield prediction, and concluded that the optimal prediction could be achieved with approximately two/one-month leading-time before single/double rice maturity. Our findings demonstrated a scalable, simple and inexpensive methods for timely predicting rice yield over a large area with publicly available multi-source data, which can potentially be applied to areas with sparsely observed data and worldwide for estimating crop yields.

The IoT-integrated SG system can provide efficient load forecasting and data acquisition technique along with cost-effectiveness. Big data analysis and machine learning techniques are essential to reaping these benefits. In the complex connected system of SG, cyber security becomes a critical issue; IoT devices and their data turning into major targets of attacks.

We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.

Machine learning models are often built from the collected data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of future events. Due to bandwidth, storage, and privacy concerns, it is often impractical to send all the data to a centralized location. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent-based approaches. We analyze the convergence bound of distributed gradient descent from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm that determines the best tradeoff between local update and global parameter aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments with real datasets, both on a networked prototype system and in a larger-scale simulated environment. The experimentation results show that our proposed approach performs near to the optimum with various machine learning models and different data distributions.

It contains various types of cells, such as cardiomyocytes, mesothelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. The interactions between these cells determine the vital functions of the heart. Therefore, identifying the different cell types and revealing the expression rules in these cell types are crucial. In this study, multiple machine learning methods were used to analyze the heart single-cell profiles with 11 different heart cell types. The single-cell profiles were first analyzed via light gradient boosting machine method to evaluate the importance of gene features on the profiling dataset, and a ranking feature list was produced. This feature list was then brought into the incremental feature selection method to identify the best features and build the optimal classifiers. The results suggested that the best decision tree (DT) and random forest classification models achieved the highest weighted F1 scores of 0.957 and 0.981, respectively. The selected features, such as NPPA, LAMA2, DLC1, and the classification rules extracted from the optimal DT classifier played a crucial role in cardiac structure and function in recent research and enrichment analysis. In particular, some lncRNAs (LINC02019, NEAT1) were found to be quite important for the recognition of different cardiac cell types. In summary, these findings provide a solid academic foundation for the development of molecular diagnostics and biomarker discovery for cardiac diseases.

Automatic Detection and Classification of Mammograms Using Improved Extreme Learning Machine with Deep Learning	IRBM			English	Article						Mammogram images; Health care; Breast cancer; Deep learning; Crow-search; Elm; Chaotic	DIGITAL MAMMOGRAMS; OPTIMIZATION	Background and objective: Breast cancer, the most intrusive form of cancer affecting women globally. Next to lung cancer, breast cancer is the one that provides a greater number of cancer deaths among women. In recent times, several intelligent methodologies were come into existence for building an effective detection and classification of such noxious type of cancer. For further improving the rate of early diagnosis and for increasing the life span of victims, optimistic light of research is essential in breast cancer classification. Accordingly, a new customized method of integrating the concept of deep learning with the extreme learning machine (ELM), which is optimized using a simple crow-search algorithm (ICS-ELM). Thus, to enhance the state-of-the-art workings, an improved deep feature-based crow-search optimized extreme learning machine is proposed for addressing the health-care problem. The paper pours a light-of-research on detecting the input mammograms as either normal or abnormal. Subsequently, it focuses on further classifying the type of abnormal severities i.e., benign type or malignant. Materials and methods: The digital mammograms for this work are taken from the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM), Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS), and INbreast datasets. Herein, the work employs 570 digital mammograms (250 normal, 200 benign and 120 malignant cases) from CBIS-DDSM dataset, 322 digital mammograms (207 normal, 64 benign and 51 malignant cases) from MIAS database and 179 full-field digital mammograms (66 normal, 56 benign and 57 malignant cases) from INbreast dataset for its evaluation. The work utilizes ResNet-18 based deep extracted features with proposed Improved Crow-Search Optimized Extreme Learning Machine (ICS-ELM) algorithm. Results: The proposed work is finally compared with the existing Support Vector Machines (RBF kernel), ELM, particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimized ELM, and crow-search optimized ELM, where the maximum overall classification accuracy is obtained for the proposed method with 97.193% for DDSM, 98.137% for MIAS and 98.266% for INbreast datasets, respectively. Conclusion: The obtained results reveal that the proposed Computer-Aided-Diagnosis (CAD) tool is robust for the automatic detection and classification of breast cancer. (C) 2021 AGBM.

A systematic literature review of machine learning methods applied to predictive maintenance	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						Predictive maintenance; Machine learning; PdM; Systematic literature review; Artificial intelligence	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK	The amount of data extracted from production processes has increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. When processed and analyzed, data can bring out valuable information and knowledge from manufacturing process, production system and equipment. In industries, equipment maintenance is an important key, and affects the operation time of equipment and its efficiency. Thus, equipment faults need to be identified and solved, avoiding shutdown in the production processes. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been emerged as a promising tool in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) applications to prevent failures in equipment that make up the production lines in the factory floor. However, the performance of PdM applications depends on the appropriate choice of the ML method. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic literature review of ML methods applied to PdM, showing which are being explored in this field and the performance of the current state-of-the-art ML techniques. This review focuses on two scientific databases and provides a useful foundation on the ML techniques, their main results, challenges and opportunities, as well as it supports new research works in the PdM field.

Here, a low-cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high-fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal-to-noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 mu A kPa(-1). With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built-in algorithm is developed for one-click health data sharing and data-driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.

Recently, the research community in the field of IoT Security endeavor hard to build anomaly, intrusion and cyber attacks traffic identification model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for IoT security analysis. However, the critical and significant problem still not studied in depth that is how to select an effective ML algorithm when there are numbers of ML algorithms for cyber attacks detection system for IoT security. In this paper, we proposed a new framework model and a hybrid algorithm to solve this problem. Firstly BoT-IoT identification dataset is applied and its 44 effective features are selected from a number of features for the machine learning algorithm. Then five effective machine learning algorithm is selected for the identification of malicious and anomaly traffic identification and also select the most widely ML algorithm performance evaluation metrics. To find out which ML algorithm is effective and should be used to select for IoT anomaly and intrusion traffic identification, a bijective soft set approach and its algorithm is applied. Then we applied the proposed algorithm based on bijective soft set approach. Our experimental results show that the proposed model with the algorithm is effective for the selection ML algorithm out of numbers of ML algorithms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Amplification of viral RNA by (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the current gold standard test for confirmation of infection, although it presents known shortcomings: long turnaround times (3-4 hours to generate results), potential shortage of reagents, false-negative rates as large as 15-20%, the need for certified laboratories, expensive equipment and trained personnel. Thus there is a need for alternative, faster, less expensive and more accessible tests. We developed two machine learning classification models using hematochemical values from routine blood exams (namely: white blood cells counts, and the platelets, CRP, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP, LDH plasma levels) drawn from 279 patients who, after being admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) emergency-room with COVID-19 symptoms, were screened with the rRT-PCR test performed on respiratory tract specimens. Of these patients, 177 resulted positive, whereas 102 received a negative response. We have developed two machine learning models, to discriminate between patients who are either positive or negative to the SARS-CoV-2: their accuracy ranges between 82% and 86%, and sensitivity between 92% e 95%, so comparably well with respect to the gold standard. We also developed an interpretable Decision Tree model as a simple decision aid for clinician interpreting blood tests (even off-line) for COVID-19 suspect cases. This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical soundness of using blood tests analysis and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for identifying COVID-19 positive patients. This is especially useful in those countries, like developing ones, suffering from shortages of rRT-PCR reagents and specialized laboratories. We made available a Web-based tool for clinical reference and evaluation (This tool is available at https://covid19- blood-ml.herokuapp.com/).

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD) level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark) and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network) to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R-2 similar to 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction.

J	Lu, HF; Ma, X; Huang, K; Azimi, M				Lu, Hongfang; Ma, Xin; Huang, Kun; Azimi, Mohammadamin			Carbon trading volume and price forecasting in China using multiple machine learning models	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						China; Carbon trading market; Price; Trading volume; Forecasting; Machine learning	GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH; FLY OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; ARPS DECLINE MODEL; HYBRID MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPLY CHAIN; SUPPORT; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION; GAS	Motivated by reducing carbon emissions, carbon trading market have been opened to promote environmental protection. Accurate carbon trading volume and price forecasts have far-reaching implications for environmental and energy policy formulation. As the country with the most massive carbon emissions in the world, China's carbon price trends, carbon trading volume trends, and policy orientation are of great significance. As matters stand, there are few studies on carbon price and trading volume forecasts, and no research paper has covered carbon price and trading volume forecasts for all carbon trading markets in China. In order to provide a relatively complete reference for the carbon price and trading volume in China, this paper uses six machine learning models to predict the daily carbon price and trading volume of eight carbon markets in China, including Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Fujian, Tianjin, Chongqing. The prediction models include extreme gradient boosting, random forest, kernel-based nonlinear extension of the Arps decline model optimized by grey wolf optimizer (GWO-KNEA), support vector machine optimized by particle swarm optimizer, support vector machine optimized by fruit fly optimizer and simulated annealing algorithm, and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Moreover, an advanced data denoising method, i.e., complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), is used in the models to smooth the raw data. Because the eight carbon trading markets have different carbon price and trading volume distribution characteristics in time series, by comparing the prediction results, more suitable models for the specific carbon market can be obtained. The prediction results show that CEEMDAN-GWO-KNEA and CEEMDAN-RBFNN are more competitive in predicting carbon prices and trading volume in China because of their best performance in many datasets. The average accuracy of CEEMDAN-RBFNN and CEMDAN-GWO-KNEA in carbon price prediction is 98.40% and 97.89%, respectively. The predictive stability of each model in different application scenarios is also discussed. The results show that high prediction accuracy does not mean better prediction stability, but CEEMDAN-RBFNN and CEMDAN-GWO-KNEA can still guarantee high stability in most datasets.

Motivated by its successful applications to many practical tasks like image recognition, both industry and the research community have advocated the applications of ML in wireless communication. This paper comprehensively surveys the recent advances of the applications of ML in wireless communication, which are classified as: resource management in the MAC layer, networking and mobility management in the network layer, and localization in the application layer. The applications in resource management further include power control, spectrum management, backhaul management, cache management, and beamformer design and computation resource management, while ML-based networking focuses on the applications in clustering, base station switching control, user association, and routing. Moreover, literatures in each aspect is organized according to the adopted ML techniques. In addition, several conditions for applying ML to wireless communication are identified to help readers decide whether to use ML and which kind of ML techniques to use. Traditional approaches are also summarized together with their performance comparison with ML-based approaches, based on which the motivations of surveyed literatures to adopt ML are clarified. Given the extensiveness of the research area, challenges and unresolved issues are presented to facilitate future studies. Specifically, ML-based network slicing, infrastructure update to support ML-based paradigms, open data sets and platforms for researchers, theoretical guidance for ML implementation, and so on are discussed.

How data from multiple sources (called multi-view data) are incorporated in a learning system is a key step for successful analysis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review on omics and clinical data integration techniques, from a machine learning perspective, for various analyses such as prediction, clustering, dimension reduction and association. We shall show that Bayesian models are able to use prior information and model measurements with various distributions; tree-based methods can either build a tree with all features or collectively make a final decision based on trees learned from each view; kernel methods fuse the similarity matrices learned from individual views together for a final similarity matrix or learning model; network-based fusion methods are capable of inferring direct and indirect associations in a heterogeneous network; matrix factorization models have potential to learn interactions among features from different views; and a range of deep neural networks can be integrated in multi-modal learning for capturing the complex mechanism of biological systems.

Machine learning for the prediction of sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy	INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE			English	Review						Machine learning; Sepsis; Septic shock; Prediction; Systematic review; Meta-analysis	INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS DEFINITIONS; SEPTIC SHOCK; MORTALITY; CRITERIA; TRENDS; MODEL	Purpose Early clinical recognition of sepsis can be challenging. With the advancement of machine learning, promising real-time models to predict sepsis have emerged. We assessed their performance by carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase.com and Scopus. Studies targeting sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock in any hospital setting were eligible for inclusion. The index test was any supervised machine learning model for real-time prediction of these conditions. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, with a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist to evaluate risk of bias. Models with a reported area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) metric were meta-analyzed to identify strongest contributors to model performance. Results After screening, a total of 28 papers were eligible for synthesis, from which 130 models were extracted. The majority of papers were developed in the intensive care unit (ICU, n = 15; 54%), followed by hospital wards (n = 7; 25%), the emergency department (ED, n = 4; 14%) and all of these settings (n = 2; 7%). For the prediction of sepsis, diagnostic test accuracy assessed by the AUROC ranged from 0.68-0.99 in the ICU, to 0.96-0.98 in-hospital and 0.87 to 0.97 in the ED. Varying sepsis definitions limit pooling of the performance across studies. Only three papers clinically implemented models with mixed results. In the multivariate analysis, temperature, lab values, and model type contributed most to model performance. Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis show that on retrospective data, individual machine learning models can accurately predict sepsis onset ahead of time. Although they present alternatives to traditional scoring systems, between-study heterogeneity limits the assessment of pooled results. Systematic reporting and clinical implementation studies are needed to bridge the gap between bytes and bedside.

The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities. Then, future research issues and challenges are explored. At last, a case study is presented with a conclusion.

However, current large-scale cloud data centers still face high failure rates due to many reasons such as hardware and software failures, which often result in task and job failures. Such failures can severely reduce the reliability of cloud services and also occupy huge amount of resources to recover the service from failures. Therefore, it is important to predict task or job failures before occurrence with high accuracy to avoid unexpected wastage. Many machine learning and deep learning based methods have been proposed for the task or job failure prediction by analyzing past system message logs and identifying the relationship between the data and the failures. In order to further improve the failure prediction accuracy of the previous machine learning and deep learning based methods, in this article, we propose a failure prediction algorithm based on multi-layer Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to identify task and job failures in the cloud. The goal of Bi-LSTM failure prediction algorithm is to predict whether the tasks and jobs are failed or completed. The trace-driven experiments show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-art prediction methods with 93 percent accuracy and 87 percent for task failure and job failures respectively.

Machine learning in chemoinformatics and drug discovery	DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY			English	Review							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; COMPOUND CLASSIFICATION; MOLECULAR SIMILARITY; LINEAR-REGRESSION; RANDOM FOREST; QSAR; PREDICTION; MODEL; DESCRIPTORS; SEARCH	Chemoinformatics is an established discipline focusing on extracting, processing and extrapolating meaningful data from chemical structures. With the rapid explosion of chemical 'big' data from HTS and combinatorial synthesis, machine learning has become an indispensable tool for drug designers to mine chemical information from large compound databases to design drugs with important biological properties. To process the chemical data, we first reviewed multiple processing layers in the chemoinformatics pipeline followed by the introduction of commonly used machine learning models in drug discovery and QSAR analysis. Here, we present basic principles and recent case studies to demonstrate the utility of machine learning techniques in chemoinformatics analyses; and we discuss limitations and future directions to guide further development in this evolving field.

Composites based on poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) have been suggested to enhance the crystallization rate and relative crystallinity of pure PLLA polymers. Despite the large amount of experimental research that has taken place to date, the theoretical aspects of relative crystallinity have not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this research uses machine learning methods to estimate the relative crystallinity of biodegradable PLLA/PGA (polyglycolide) composites. Six different artificial intelligent classes were employed to estimate the relative crystallinity of PLLA/PGA polymer composites as a function of crystallization time, temperature, and PGA content. Cumulatively, 1510 machine learning topologies, including 200 multilayer perceptron neural networks, 200 cascade feedforward neural networks (CFFNN), 160 recurrent neural networks, 800 adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, and 150 least-squares support vector regressions, were developed, and their prediction accuracy compared. The modeling results show that a single hidden layer CFFNN with 9 neurons is the most accurate method for estimating 431 experimentally measured datasets. This model predicts an experimental database with an average absolute percentage difference of 8.84%, root mean squared errors of 4.67%, and correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.999008. The modeling results and relevancy studies show that relative crystallinity increases based on the PGA content and crystallization time. Furthermore, the effect of temperature on relative crystallinity is too complex to be easily explained.

Recent revolutions made in data science could have a great impact on traditional catalysis research in both industry and academia and could accelerate the development of catalysts. Machine learning (ML), a subfield of data science, can play a central role in this paradigm shift away from the use of traditional approaches. In this review, we present a user's guide for ML that we believe will be helpful for scientists performing research in the field of catalysis and summarize recent progress that has been made in utilizing ML to create homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The focus of the review is on the design, synthesis, and characterization of catalytic materials/compounds as well as their applications to catalyzed processes. The ML technique not only enhances ways to discover catalysts but also serves as a powerful tool to establish a deeper understanding of relationships between the properties of materials/compounds and their catalytic activities, selectivities, and stabilities. This knowledge facilitates the establishment of principles employed to design catalysts and to enhance their efficiencies. Despite such advantages of ML, it is noteworthly that the current ML-assisted development of real catalysts remains in its infancy, mainly because of the complexity of catalysis associated with the fact that catalysis is a time dependent dynamic event. In this review, we discuss how seamless integration of experiment, theory, and data science can be used to accelerate catalyst development and to guide future studies aimed at applications that will impact society's need to produce energy, materials, and chemicals. Moreover, the limitations and difficulties of ML in catalysis research originating from the complex nature of catalysis are discussed in order to make the catalysis community aware of challenges that need to be addressed for effective and practical use of ML in the field.

However, their conclusions are often based on pre-engineered features depriving DL of its main advantage - representation learning. We conduct a large-scale systematic comparison profiled in multiple classification and regression tasks on structural MRI images and show the importance of representation learning for DL. Results show that if trained following prevalent DL practices, DL methods have the potential to scale particularly well and substantially improve compared to SML methods, while also presenting a lower asymptotic complexity in relative computational time, despite being more complex. We also demonstrate that DL embeddings span comprehensible task-specific projection spectra and that DL consistently localizes task-discriminative brain biomarkers. Our findings highlight the presence of nonlinearities in neuroimaging data that DL can exploit to generate superior task-discriminative representations for characterizing the human brain. Recent critical commentaries unfavorably compare deep learning (DL) with standard machine learning (SML) for brain imaging data analysis. Here, the authors show that if trained following prevalent DL practices, DL methods substantially improve compared to SML methods by encoding robust discriminative brain representations.

However, developing and selecting accurate time series models is a challenging task as this requires training several different models for selecting the best amongst them along with substantial feature engineering to derive informative features and finding optimal time lags, a commonly used input features for time series models. Methods: Our approach uses machine learning and a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network with various configurations to construct forecasting models for short to medium term aggregate load forecasting. The research solves above mentioned problems by training several linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms and picking the best as baseline, choosing best features using wrapper and embedded feature selection methods and finally using genetic algorithm (GA) to find optimal time lags and number of layers for LSTM model predictive performance optimization. Results: Using France metropolitan's electricity consumption data as a case study, obtained results show that LSTM based model has shown high accuracy then machine learning model that is optimized with hyperparameter tuning. Using the best features, optimal lags, layers and training various LSTM configurations further improved forecasting accuracy. Conclusions: A LSTM model using only optimally selected time lagged features captured all the characteristics of complex time series and showed decreased Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for medium to long range forecasting for a wider metropolitan area.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of MMEs developed using machine learning (ML) algorithms with different combinations of GCMs ranked based on their performance and determine the optimum number of GCMs to be included in an MME. In this study ML algorithms; Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) were used to develop MMEs for annual, monsoon and winter; precipitation (P), maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperature over Pakistan using 36 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 GCMs. GCMs were ranked using Taylor Skill Score for individual seasons and variables, and then using a comprehensive Rating Metric (RM) overall rank of each GCM was determined. It was found that, HadGEM2-AO is the most skilled GCM and IPSL-CM5B-LR is the least skilled GCMs in simulating the 3 climate variables. The performance of MMEs did not improve after the inclusion of about 18 top-ranked GCMs. Thus, it was understood that the optimum performance of MMEs is achieved when about 50% of the top-ranked GCMs are used. The intercomparison of MMEs developed with ANN, KNN, SVM and RVM revealed that KNN and RVM-based MMEs show better skills. It was found that RVM yields MMEs which show smaller variations in performance over space unlike ANN which displayed large fluctuations in performance over space. KNN and RVM are recommended over SVM and ANN for the development of MMEs over Pakistan.

Machine learning prediction of mechanical properties of concrete: Critical review	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Review						Artificial neural network; Decision tree; Support vector machine; Compressive strength; Shear strength; Evolutionary algorithm; Statistical metric	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH PREDICTION; HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; SHEAR-STRENGTH; ELASTIC-MODULUS; STEEL FIBER; NONLINEAR-REGRESSION	Accurate prediction of the mechanical properties of concrete has been a concern since these properties are often required by design codes. The emergence of new concrete mixtures and applications has motivated researchers to pursue reliable models for predicting mechanical strength. Empirical and statistical models, such as linear and nonlinear regression, have been widely used. However, these models require laborious experimental work to develop, and can provide inaccurate results when the relationships between concrete properties and mixture composition and curing conditions are complex. To overcome such drawbacks, several Machine Learning (ML) models have been proposed as an alternative approach for predicting the mechanical strength of concrete. The present study examines ML models for forecasting the mechanical properties of concrete, including artificial neural networks, support vector machine, decision trees, and evolutionary algorithms. The application of each model and its performance are critically discussed and analyzed, thus identifying practical recommendations, current knowledge gaps, and needed future research.

CENTER-TBI Collaborators	Machine learning algorithms performed no better than regression models for prognostication in traumatic brain injury	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Machine learning; Prognosis; Traumatic brain injury; Prediction; Data science; Cohort study	BIG DATA; VALIDATION; PROGNOSIS; TUTORIAL; CARE	Objective: We aimed to explore the added value of common machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of outcome for moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. Study Design and Setting: We performed logistic regression (LR), lasso regression, and ridge regression with key baseline predictors in the IMPACT-II database (15 studies, n = 11,022). ML algorithms included support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and artificial neural networks and were trained using the same predictors. To assess generalizability of predictions, we performed internal, internal-external, and external validation on the recent CENTER-TBI study (patients with Glasgow Coma Scale <13, n = 1,554). Both calibration (calibration slope/intercept) and discrimination (area under the curve) was quantified. Results: In the IMPACT-II database, 3,332/11,022 (30%) died and 5,233(48%) had unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale less than 4). In the CENTER-TBI study, 348/1,554(29%) died and 651(54%) had unfavorable outcome. Discrimination and calibration varied widely between the studies and less so between the studied algorithms. The mean area under the curve was 0.82 for mortality and 0.77 for unfavorable outcomes in the CENTER-TBI study. Conclusion: ML algorithms may not outperform traditional regression approaches in a low-dimensional setting for outcome prediction after moderate or severe traumatic brain injury. Similar to regression-based prediction models, ML algorithms should be rigorously validated to ensure applicability to new populations. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Chen, HH; Zhang, LY				Chen, Haohua; Zhang, Lianyang			A Machine Learning-Based Method for Predicting End-Bearing Capacity of Rock-Socketed Shafts	ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING			English	Article						Rock-socketed shaft; End-bearing capacity; Machine learning; Graphical user interface	SHALLOW FOUNDATIONS; PILE; MASS; TIP	This paper presents a machine learning (ML)-based method for predicting the end-bearing capacity of rock-socketed shafts. For ML model training and testing, a database of 151 test shafts covering a wide range of rock types, shaft dimensions, and ground profiles has been developed from various sources. To properly take into account different factors, the rock property constant m(i), unconfined compressive strength of intact rock sigma(c) (MPa), geological strength index GSI, length of the shaft within the soil layer H-s (m), length of the shaft within the rock layer H-r (m), and shaft diameter B (m) were taken as the inputs and the ultimate bearing capacity factor N-sigma, which is the ratio of ultimate end-bearing capacity to sigma(c), was taken as the target output. Four commonly used ML algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were first utilized to train models, respectively. Then, the trained models with the four ML algorithms were fused together with an ensemble learning (EL) approach to further enhance the prediction accuracy. Comparisons with existing empirical equations show a much better performance of the ML-based method for predicting the end-bearing capacity of rock-socketed shafts. Parametric studies were also performed with the EL model to investigate the importance of the six input parameters and the results show that the most important parameter is sigma(c), followed by B, GSI, H-r, H-s and m(i) in the order of importance. For the convenient application of the ML-based method, a graphical user interface (GUI) app has been developed. Finally, two examples were analyzed to demonstrate the application of the GUI app with the implemented EL models. The results show that the GUI app can be used for quick and accurate prediction of the end-bearing capacity of rock-socketed shafts by considering the various parameters.

These technologies hold great potential for large-scale ecological understanding, but are limited by current processing approaches which inefficiently distill data into relevant information. We argue that animal ecologists can capitalize on large datasets generated by modern sensors by combining machine learning approaches with domain knowledge. Incorporating machine learning into ecological workflows could improve inputs for ecological models and lead to integrated hybrid modeling tools. This approach will require close interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the quality of novel approaches and train a new generation of data scientists in ecology and conservation. Animal ecologists are increasingly limited by constraints in data processing. Here, Tuia and colleagues discuss how collaboration between ecologists and data scientists can harness machine learning to capitalize on the data generated from technological advances and lead to novel modeling approaches.

It is due to the availability of these platforms that the dissemination of fake news has become easier. Anyone using these platforms can create and share fake news content based on personal or professional motives. To address the issue of detecting fake news, numerous studies based on supervised and unsupervised learning methods have been proposed. However, all those studies do suffer from a certain limitation of poor accuracy. The reason for poor accuracy can be attributed due to several reasons such as the poor selection of features, inefficient tuning of parameters, imbalanced datasets, etc. In this article, we have proposed an ensemble classification model for detection of the fake news that has achieved a better accuracy compared to the state-of-the art. The proposed model extracts important features from the fake news datasets, and the extracted features are then classified using the ensemble model comprising of three popular machine learning models namely, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Extra Tree Classifier. We achieved a training and testing accuracy of 99.8% and 44.15% respectively on the Liar dataset. For the ISOT dataset, we achieved the training and testing accuracy of 100%. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Machine learning in cardiovascular medicine: are we there yet?	HEART			English	Review						heart disease	PROTEIN-SEQUENCE; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES; DISEASE	Artificial intelligence (AI) broadly refers to analytical algorithms that iteratively learn from data, allowing computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. These include a family of operations encompassing several terms like machine learning, cognitive learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning-based methods that can be used to integrate and interpret complex biomedical and healthcare data in scenarios where traditional statistical methods may not be able to perform. In this review article, we discuss the basics of machine learning algorithms and what potential data sources exist; evaluate the need for machine learning; and examine the potential limitations and challenges of implementing machine in the context of cardiovascular medicine. The most promising avenues for AI in medicine are the development of automated risk prediction algorithms which can be used to guide clinical care; use of unsupervised learning techniques to more precisely phenotype complex disease; and the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to intelligently augment healthcare providers. The utility of a machine learning-based predictive model will depend on factors including data heterogeneity, data depth, data breadth, nature of modelling task, choice of machine learning and feature selection algorithms, and orthogonal evidence. A critical understanding of the strength and limitations of various methods and tasks amenable to machine learning is vital. By leveraging the growing corpus of big data in medicine, we detail pathways by which machine learning may facilitate optimal development of patient-specific models for improving diagnoses, intervention and outcome in cardiovascular medicine.

J	Al-Najjar, HAH; Pradhan, B				Al-Najjar, Husam A. H.; Pradhan, Biswajeet			Spatial landslide susceptibility assessment using machine learning techniques assisted by additional data created with generative adversarial networks	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS			English	Article						Landslide susceptibility; Inventory; Machine learning; Generative adversarial network; Convolutional neural network; Geographic information system	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; FREQUENCY RATIO; DECISION-TREE; MODELS; MOUNTAINS; SELECTION; WEIGHTS; ENTROPY	In recent years, landslide susceptibility mapping has substantially improved with advances in machine learning. However, there are still challenges remain in landslide mapping due to the availability of limited inventory data. In this paper, a novel method that improves the performance of machine learning techniques is presented. The proposed method creates synthetic inventory data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for improving the prediction of landslides. In this research, landslide inventory data of 156 landslide locations were identified in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, taken from previous projects the authors worked on. Elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, total curvature, lithology, land use and land cover (LULC), distance to the road, distance to the river, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), terrain roughness index (TRI), topographic wetness index (TWI) and vegetation density are geo-environmental factors considered in this study based on suggestions from previous works on Cameron Highlands. To show the capability of GANs in improving landslide prediction models, this study tests the proposed GAN model with benchmark models namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Bagging ensemble models with ANN and SVM models. These models were validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The DT, RF, SVM, ANN and Bagging ensemble could achieve the AUROC values of (0.90, 0.94, 0.86, 0.69 and 0.82) for the training; and the AUROC of (0.76, 0.81, 0.85, 0.72 and 0.75) for the test, subsequently. When using additional samples, the same models achieved the AUROC values of (0.92, 0.94, 0.88, 0.75 and 0.84) for the training and (0.78, 0.82, 0.82, 0.78 and 0.80) for the test, respectively. Using the additional samples improved the test accuracy of all the models except SVM. As a result, in data-scarce environments, this research showed that utilizing GANs to generate supplementary samples is promising because it can improve the predictive capability of common landslide prediction models.

The prediction model is mainly based on the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) optimized by the improved Harris hawk's optimizer (HHO). In order to obtain better parameters and feature subsets, the Gaussian barebone (GB) strategy is introduced to improve the HHO algorithm, so as to strengthen the optimization ability for tuning parameters of KELM and identifying the compact feature subsets. Then, an optimal KELM model (GBHHO-KELM) is established according to the obtained optimal parameters and feature subsets to predict the entrepreneurial intention of students. In the experiment, GBHHO is compared with the other nine well-known methods in 30 CEC 2014 benchmark problems. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed GBHHO method is significantly superior to the existing methods in most problems. At the same time, GBHHO-KELM is compared with other machine learning methods in the prediction of entrepreneurial intention. The experimental results indicate that the proposed GBHHO-KELM can achieve better classification performance and higher stability in accordance with the four metrics. Therefore, we can conclude that the GBHHO-KELM model is expected to be an effective tool for the prediction of entrepreneurial intention.

Using a glove as an intuitive and low-cost HMI can expediently track the motions of human fingers, resulting in a straightforward communication media of human-machine interactions. When combining several triboelectric textile sensors and proper machine learning technique, it has great potential to realize complex gesture recognition with the minimalist-designed glove for the comprehensive control in both real and virtual space. However, humidity or sweat may negatively affect the triboelectric output as well as the textile itself. Hence, in this work, a facile carbon nanotubes/thermoplastic elastomer (CNTs/TPE) coating approach is investigated in detail to achieve superhydrophobicity of the triboelectric textile for performance improvement. With great energy harvesting and human motion sensing capabilities, the glove using the superhydrophobic textile realizes a low-cost and self-powered interface for gesture recognition. By leveraging machine learning technology, various gesture recognition tasks are done in real time by using gestures to achieve highly accurate virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) controls including gun shooting, baseball pitching, and flower arrangement, with minimized effect from sweat during operation.

However, the possible ML models and materials descriptors are numerous, and a rational recipe to rapidly choose the best combination of the two is needed. In the present study, we propose a systematic framework that utilizes a genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently select the ML model and materials descriptors from a huge number of alternatives and demonstrated its efficiency on two phase formation problems in high entropy alloys (HEAs). The optimized classification model allows an accuracy for identifying solid-solution and non-solid-solution HEAs to be up to 88.7% and further for recognizing body-centered-cubic (BCC), face-centered-cubic (FCC), and dual-phase HEAs to reach 91.3%. Furthermore, by employing an active learning approach, several HEAs with largest classification uncertainties were selected, experimentally synthesized and phase-identified, and augmented to the initial dataset to iteratively improve the ML model. The method serves as a general algorithm to select materials descriptors and ML models for various material problems including classification and optimization of targeted properties.

J	Abdi, AM				Abdi, Abdulhakim Mohamed			Land cover and land use classification performance of machine learning algorithms in a boreal landscape using Sentinel-2 data	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						machine learning; Sentinel-2; land cover; land use; classification; boreal	IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; RANDOM FOREST; RED-EDGE; INDEX; ACCURACY; AREA; DIFFERENCE; ACQUISITION; QUALITY; ERROR	In recent years, the data science and remote sensing communities have started to align due to user-friendly programming tools, access to high-end consumer computing power, and the availability of free satellite data. In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes. In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar's chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 +/- 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 +/- 0.017), random forests (0.739 +/- 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 +/- 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar's test results showed that 62% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25%) and shortwave infrared (23%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38%) and summer (40%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified. The article concludes with recommendations for future research.

This study reviews the state-of-the-art application of deep learning algorithms for processing geochemical exploration data and mining the geochemical patterns. Deep learning algorithms can deal with complex and nonlinear problems and, therefore, can enhance the identification of geochemical anomalies and the recognition of hidden patterns.

Venturing the investigation of complex phenomena on large scales requires fast yet accurate computational methods. We review the emerging field of machine-learned potentials, which promises to reach the accuracy of quantum mechanical computations at a substantially reduced computational cost. This Review will summarize the basic principles of the underlying machine learning methods, the data acquisition process and active learning procedures. We highlight multiple recent applications of machine-learned potentials in various fields, ranging from organic chemistry and biomolecules to inorganic crystal structure predictions and surface science. We furthermore discuss the developments required to promote a broader use of ML potentials, and the possibility of using them to help solve open questions in materials science and facilitate fully computational materials design. Materials simulations are now ubiquitous for explaining material properties. This Review discusses how machine-learned potentials break the limitations of system-size or accuracy, how active-learning will aid their development, how they are applied, and how they may become a more widely used approach.

After the recent COVID-19 outbreak, almost all countries were forced to impose strict measures and regulations in order to control the virus spread. Predicting the number of new cases is crucial when evaluating which measures should be implemented. The improved forecasting approach was then used to predict the number of the COVID-19 cases. The proposed prediction model represents a hybridized approach between machine learning, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and enhanced beetle antennae search swarm intelligence metaheuristics. The enhanced beetle antennae search is utilized to determine the parameters of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and to improve the overall performance of the prediction model. First, an enhanced beetle antennae search algorithm has been implemented that overcomes deficiencies of its original version. The enhanced algorithm was tested and validated against a wider set of benchmark functions and proved that it substantially outperforms original implementation. Afterwards, the proposed hybrid method for COVID-19 cases prediction was then evaluated using the World Health Organization's official data on the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The proposed method has been compared against several existing state-of-the-art approaches that were tested on the same datasets. The proposed CESBAS-ANFIS achieved R-2 score of 0.9763, which is relatively high when compared to the R-2 value of 0.9645, achieved by FPASSA-ANFIS. To further evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, it has also been validated against two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in China and the USA. Simulation results and the comparative analysis show that the proposed hybrid method managed to outscore other sophisticated approaches that were tested on the same datasets and proved to be a useful tool for time-series prediction.

Existing empirical and machine learning models for estimating R-s from sunshine duration were comprehensively reviewed. The performances of 12 empirical model forms and 12 machine learning algorithms for estimating daily Rs were further evaluated in different climatic zones of China as a case study, i.e. the temperate continental zone (TCZ), temperate monsoon zone (TMZ), mountain plateau zone (MPZ) and (sub) tropical monsoon zone (SMZ). The best-performing model at each station and the overall best model for each climatic zone were selected based on six statistical indictors, a global performance index (GPI) and computational costs (computational time and memory usage). The results revealed that the machine learning models (RMSE: 2.055-2.751 MJ m(-2) d(-1); NRMSE: 12.8-21.3%; R-2: 0.839-0.936) generally outperformed the empirical models (RMSE: 2.118-3.540 MJ m(-2) d(-1); NRMSE: 12.1-27.5%; R-2: 0.834-0.935) in terms of prediction accuracy. The cubic model (M3), modified linear-logarithmic model (M5) and power model (M10) attained generally better ranks among empirical models based on GPI. M3 was the top-ranked model in TMZ and MPZ, while general best performance was obtained by M5 and M2 in SMZ and TCZ, respectively. ANFIS, ELM, LSSVM and MARS obtained generally better performance among machine learning models, with the overall best ranking by ANFIS in TCZ and SMZ and by ELM in MPZ and SMZ. XGBoost (8.1 s and 74.2 MB), M5Tree (11.3 s and 29.7 MB), GRNN (12.3 s and 295.3 MB), MARS (14.4 s and 42.6 MB), MLP (22.4 s and 41.3 MB) and ANFIS (29.8 s and 23.1 MB) showed relatively small computational time and memory usage. Comprehensively considering both the prediction accuracy and computational costs, ANFIS is highly recommended, while MARS and XGBoost are also promising models for daily R-s estimation.

Their theoretical description requires highly accurate quantum chemical calculations, which are computationally expensive. In this review, we focus on not only how machine learning is employed to speed up such excited-state simulations but also how this branch of artificial intelligence can be used to advance this exciting research field in all its aspects. Discussed applications of machine learning for excited states include excited-state dynamics simulations, static calculations of absorption spectra, as well as many others. In order to put these studies into context, we discuss the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques. Since the latter are mostly based on quantum chemistry calculations, we also provide a short introduction into excited-state electronic structure methods and approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and describe tricks and problems when using them in machine learning for excited states of molecules.

The biological structure and symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral chest maladies, which makes it challenging and a big issue to improve approaches for efficient identification of COVID-19 disease. In this study, an automatic prediction of COVID-19 identification is proposed to automatically discriminate between healthy and COVID-19 infected subjects in X-ray images using two successful moderns are traditional machine learning methods (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), linear kernel and radial basis function (RBF), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Decision Tree (DT), andCN2 rule inducer techniques) and deep learning models (e.g., MobileNets V2, ResNet50, GoogleNet, DarkNet andXception). A largeX-ray dataset has been created and developed, namely the COVID-19 vs. Normal (400 healthy cases, and 400 COVID cases). To the best of our knowledge, it is currently the largest publicly accessible COVID-19 dataset with the largest number of X-ray images of confirmed COVID-19 infection cases. Based on the results obtained from the experiments, it can be concluded that all the models performed well, deep learning models had achieved the optimum accuracy of 98.8% in ResNet50 model. In comparison, in traditional machine learning techniques, the SVM demonstrated the best result for an accuracy of 95% and RBF accuracy 94% for the prediction of coronavirus disease 2019.

However, no review, to date, has offered a wholistic retrospection of this research. To address this gap, we provide an overview of AI and ML research in finance. Using both co-citation and bibliometric-coupling analyses, we infer the thematic structure of AI and ML research in finance for 1986-April 2021. By uncovering nine (co-citation) and eight (bibliometric coupling) specific clusters of finance that apply AI and ML, we further identify three overarching groups of finance scholarship that are roughly equivalent for both forms of analysis: (1) portfolio construction, valuation, and investor behavior; (2) financial fraud and distress; and (3) sentiment inference, forecasting, and planning. Additionally, using co-occurrence and confluence analyses, we highlight trends and research directions regarding AI and ML in finance research. Our results provide assessment of AI and ML in finance research. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Machine Learning with F-18-Sodium Fluoride PET and Quantitative Plaque Analysis on CT Angiography for the Future Risk of Myocardial Infarction	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						myocardial infarction; CT; F-18-NaF PET; quantitative plaque analysis; machine-learning	PREDICTION; DISEASE; VALIDATION; MORTALITY	Coronary F-18-sodium fluoride (F-18-NaF) PET and CT angiography- based quantitative plaque analysis have shown promise in refining risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease. We combined both of these novel imaging approaches to develop an optimal machine-learning model for the future risk of myocardial infarction in patients with stable coronary disease. Methods: Patients with known coronary artery disease underwent coronary F-18-NaF PET and CT angiography on a hybrid PET/CT scanner. Machine-learning by extreme gradient boosting was trained using clinical data, CT quantitative plaque analysis, measures and F-18-NaF PET, and it was tested using repeated 10-fold hold-out testing. Results: Among 293 study participants (65 +/- 9 y; 84% male), 22 subjects experienced a myocardial infarction over the 53 (40-59) months of follow-up. On univariable receiver-operator-curve analysis, only F-18-NaF coronary uptake emerged as a predictor of myocardial infarction (c-statistic 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.83). When incorporated into machine-learning models, clinical characteristics showed limited predictive performance (c-statistic 0.64, 95% CI 0.53-0.76) and were outperformed by a quantitative plaque analysis-based machine-learning model (c-statistic 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.84). After inclusion of all available data (clinical, quantitative plaque and F-18-NaF PET), we achieved a substantial improvement (P = 0.008 versus F-18-NaF PET alone) in the model performance (c-statistic 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.91). Conclusion: Both F-18-NaF uptake and quantitative plaque analysis measures are additive and strong predictors of outcome in patients with established coronary artery disease.

J	Kamir, E; Waldner, F; Hochman, Z				Kamir, Elisa; Waldner, Francois; Hochman, Zvi			Estimating wheat yields in Australia using climate records, satellite image time series and machine learning methods	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Agriculture; Machine learning; Actual yield; Yield Gap; Remote sensing; National scale; Regression	AREA INDEX RETRIEVAL; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES; REGIONAL-SCALE; RANDOM FORESTS; USE EFFICIENCY; GAP ANALYSIS; CROP YIELDS; CORN YIELD; LAND-COVER	Closing the yield gap between actual and potential wheat yields in Australia is important to meet the growing global demand for food. The identification of hotspots of the yield gap, where the potential for improvement is the greatest, is a necessary step towards this goal. While crop growth models are well suited to quantify potential yields, they lack the ability to provide accurate large-scale estimates of actual yields, owing to the sheer quantity of data they require for parameterisation. In this context, we sought to provide accurate estimates of actual wheat yields across the Australian wheat belt based on machine-learning regression methods, climate records and satellite image time series. Out of nine base learners and two ensembles, support vector regression with radial basis function emerged as the single best learner (root mean square error of 0.55 t ha(-1) and R-2 of 0.77 at the pixel level). At national scale, this model explained 73% of the yield variability observed across statistical units. Benchmark approaches based on peak Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and on a harvest index were largely outperformed by the machine-learning regression models (R-2 < 0.46). Climate variables such as maximum temperatures and accumulated rainfall provided additional information to the 16-day NDVI time series as they significantly improved yield predictions. Variables observed up to and around the flowering period had a particularly high predictive power with additional information gained from data during grain filling. We further showed that, while all models were sensitive to a reduction of the training set size, a large majority had not reached saturation with a data set of 125 fields (2000 pixels). This indicates that additional training data are likely to further improve the skill of the models. We estimated that observations from 75 fields (1200 pixels) are required for the best single model to reach an R-2 of 0.7. We contend that machine-learning regression methods applied to climate and satellite image time series can achieve reliable crop yield monitoring across years at both the pixel and the country scale. The resulting yield estimates meet the accuracy requirements for mapping the yield gap and identifying yield gap hotspots which could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisers.

For a long time, the networking and distributed computing system is the key infrastructure to provide efficient computational resources for machine learning. Networking itself can also benefit from this promising technology. This article focuses on the application of MLN, which can not only help solve the intractable old network questions but also stimulate new network applications. In this article, we summarize the basic workflow to explain how to apply machine learning technology in the networking domain. Then we provide a selective survey of the latest representative advances with explanations of their design principles and benefits. These advances are divided into several network design objectives and the detailed information of how they perform in each step of MLN workflow is presented. Finally, we shed light on the new opportunities in networking design and community building of this new inter-discipline. Our goal is to provide a broad research guideline on networking with machine learning to help motivate researchers to develop innovative algorithms, standards and frameworks.

This has led to increased efforts to extract meaning from these measurements and to integrate various data sets. Concurrently, machine learning has rapidly evolved and is now widely applied in science in general and in plant genotyping and phenotyping in particular. Here, we review the application of machine learning in the context of plant science and plant breeding. We focus on analyses at different phenotype levels, from biochemical to yield, and in connecting genotypes to these. In this way, we illustrate how machine learning offers a suite of methods that enable researchers to find meaningful patterns in relevant plant data.

However, the outcomes of previous methods are likely to reveal no more than current key technologies, since they can only be performed at later stages of technology development due to the time required for patents to be cited (or fail to be cited). This study proposes a machine learning approach to identifying emerging technologies at early stages using multiple patent indicators that can be defined immediately after the relevant patents are issued. For this, first, a total of 18 input and 3 output indicators are extracted from the United States Patent and Trademark Office database. Second, a feed-forward multilayer neural network is employed to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between input and output indicators in a time period of interest. Finally, two quantitative indicators are developed to identify trends of a technology's emergingness over time. Based on this, we also provide the practical guidelines for implementation of the proposed approach. The case of pharmaceutical technology shows that our approach can facilitate responsive technology forecasting and planning.

We investigated neuroanatomical subtypes in a multi-institutional multi-ethnic cohort, using novel semi-supervised machine learning methods designed to discover patterns associated with disease rather than normal anatomical variation. Structural MRI and clinical measures in established schizophrenia (n = 307) and healthy controls (n = 364) were analysed across three sites of PHENOM (Psychosis Heterogeneity Evaluated via Dimensional Neuroimaging) consortium. Regional volumetric measures of grey matter, white matter, and CSF were used to identify distinct and reproducible neuroanatomical subtypes of schizophrenia. Two distinct neuroanatomical subtypes were found. Subtype 1 showed widespread lower grey matter volumes, most prominent in thalamus, nucleus accumbens, medial temporal, medial prefrontal/frontal and insular cortices. Subtype 2 showed increased volume in the basal ganglia and internal capsule, and otherwise normal brain volumes. Grey matter volume correlated negatively with illness duration in Subtype 1 ( r = -0.201, P= 0.016) but not in Subtype 2 (r = -0.045, P = 0.652), potentially indicating different underlying neuropathological processes. The subtypes did not differ in age (t = -1.603, df = 305, P. 0.109), sex (chi-square = 0.013, df = 1, P. 0.910), illness duration (t = -0.167, df = 277, P = 0.868), antipsychotic dose (t = -0.439, df = 210, P = 0.521), age of illness onset (t = -1.355, df = 277, P. 0.177), positive symptoms (t = 0.249, df = 289, P. 0.803), negative symptoms (t = 0.151, df = 289, P. 0.879), or antipsychotic type (chi-square = 6.670, df = 3, P= 0.083). Subtype 1 had lower educational attainment than Subtype 2 (chi-square = 6.389, df = 2, P. 0.041). In conclusion, we discovered two distinct and highly reproducible neuroanatomical subtypes. Subtype 1 displayed widespread volume reduction correlating with illness duration, and worse premorbid functioning. Subtype 2 had normal and stable anatomy, except for larger basal ganglia and internal capsule, not explained by antipsychotic dose. These subtypes challenge the notion that brain volume loss is a general feature of schizophrenia and suggest differential aetiologies. They can facilitate strategies for clinical trial enrichment and stratification, and precision diagnostics.

The research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods. This survey can be used as a guideline for hydrologists as well as climate scientists in choosing the proper ML method according to the prediction task.

J	Zekic-Susac, M; Mitrovic, S; Has, A				Zekic-Susac, Marijana; Mitrovic, Sasa; Has, Adela			Machine learning based system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as an approach towards smart cities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Planning models; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Public sector; Smart cities	BIG DATA; INTELLIGENCE; MANAGEMENT	Energy efficiency of public sector is an important issue in the context of smart cities due to the fact that buildings are the largest energy consumers, especially public buildings such as educational, health, government and other public institutions that have a large usage frequency. However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment.

However, CTA generally overestimates stenosis severity compared with invasive angiography, and angiographic stenosis does not necessarily imply hemodynamic relevance when fractional flow reserve (FFR) is used as reference. CTA-based FFR (CT-FFR), using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), improves the correlation with invasive FFR results but is computationally demanding. More recently, a new machine-learning (ML) CT-FFR algorithm has been developed based on a deep learning model, which can be performed on a regular workstation. In this large multicenter cohort, the diagnostic performance ML-based CT-FFR was compared with CTA and CFD-based CT-FFR for detection of functionally obstructive coronary artery disease. Methods and Results: At 5 centers in Europe, Asia, and the United States, 351 patients, including 525 vessels with invasive FFR comparison, were included. ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR were performed on the CTA data, and diagnostic performance was evaluated using invasive FFR as reference. Correlation between ML-based and CFD-based CT-FFR was excellent (R=0.997). ML-based (area under curve, 0.84) and CFD-based CT-FFR (0.84) outperformed visual CTA (0.69; P<0.0001). On a per-vessel basis, diagnostic accuracy improved from 58% (95% confidence interval, 54%-63%) by CTA to 78% (75%-82%) by ML-based CT-FFR. The per-patient accuracy improved from 71% (66%-76%) by CTA to 85% (81%-89%) by adding ML-based CT-FFR as 62 of 85 (73%) false-positive CTA results could be correctly reclassified by adding ML-based CT-FFR. Conclusions: On-site CT-FFR based on ML improves the performance of CTA by correctly reclassifying hemodynamically nonsignificant stenosis and performs equally well as CFD-based CT-FFR.

APOPLASTP: prediction of effectors and plant proteins in the apoplast using machine learning	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						apoplast; apoplastic localization; APOPLASTP; effectors; machine learning; plant pathogens; plant proteomics	COMBINED TRANSMEMBRANE TOPOLOGY; SIGNAL PEPTIDE PREDICTION; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; SECRETED EFFECTORS; WEB SERVER; PTR TOXA; TRITICI; PROTEOME; AVIRULENCE; PATHOGENS	The plant apoplast is integral to intercellular signalling, transport and plant-pathogen interactions. Plant pathogens deliver effectors both into the apoplast and inside host cells, but no computational method currently exists to discriminate between these localizations. We present APOPLASTP, the first method for predicting whether an effector or plant protein localizes to the apoplast. APOPLASTP uncovers features of apoplastic localization common to both effectors and plant proteins, namely depletion in glutamic acid, acidic amino acids and charged amino acids and enrichment in small amino acids. APOPLASTP predicts apoplastic localization in effectors with a sensitivity of 75% and a false positive rate of 5%, improving the accuracy of cysteine-rich classifiers by > 13%. APOPLASTP does not depend on the presence of a signal peptide and correctly predicts the localization of unconventionally secreted proteins. The secretomes of fungal saprophytes as well as necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic and extracellular fungal pathogens are enriched for predicted apoplastic proteins. Rust pathogens have low proportions of predicted apoplastic proteins, but these are highly enriched for predicted effectors. APOPLASTP pioneers apoplastic localization prediction using machine learning. It will facilitate functional studies and will be valuable for predicting if an effector localizes to the apoplast or if it enters plant cells.

The network operators need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures. Traditional networking approaches, i.e., reactive, centrally-managed, one-size-fits-all approaches, and conventional data analysis tools that have limited capability (space and time) are not competent anymore and cannot satisfy and serve that future complex networks regarding operation and optimization cost effectively. A novel paradigm of proactive, self-aware, self-adaptive, and predictive networking is much needed. The network operators have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic exploitation of the big data dramatically helps in making the system smart, intelligent, and facilitates efficient as well as cost-effective operation and optimization. We envision data-driven next-generation wireless networks, where the network operators employ advanced data analytics, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics, and the role of ML, artificial intelligence in making the system intelligent regarding being self-aware, self-adaptive, proactive and prescriptive. A set of network design and optimization schemes are presented concerning data analytics. This paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and the benefits of adopting big data analytics, ML, and artificial intelligence in the next-generation communication systems.

Integrated phenology and climate in rice yields prediction using machine learning methods	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Early mature rice; Machine learning (ML) methods; Multiple linear regression (MLR); Rice yield prediction; Phenology	BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL-NETWORKS; PAST 3 DECADES; RANDOM FOREST; CROP YIELD; CARBON ALLOCATION; WHEAT YIELD; CONJUGATE-GRADIENT; LINEAR-REGRESSION; GROWTH DURATION; BIOMASS GROWTH	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple cereal crop and its demand is substantially increasing with the growth of the global population. Precisely predicting rice yields are of vital importance to ensure the food security in countries like China, where rice accounts for one-fifth of the total agricultural production. Previous studies found that the rice yields had been significantly impacted by climate change. In addition, phenological variables were found to be important factors concerning rice yields due to its fundamental role in carbon allocation between plant organs, but its impacts on rice yields were seldom evaluated. In this study, eleven combinations of phenology, climate and geography data were tested to predict the site-based rice yields using a traditional regression-based method (MLR, multiple linear regression), and more advanced three machine learning (ML) methods: back-propagation neural network (BP), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The results showed that ML methods were more precise than MLR method. The combination using the integrated phenology, climate during growing season and geographical information was better for yields predictions than other combinations across the ML methods, e.g. the difference RMSE (R-2) between prediction and observed rice yields were 800 (0.24), 737 (0.33), and 744 (0.31) kg/ha for BP, SVM and RF, respectively. The SVM had achieved the highest precisions in yield predictions and the phenological variables substantially improved the accuracy of yield predictions, and the relative importance of phenological variables were even similar as climatic variables. We highlight the phenology and climate need to be accurately represented in the crop models to improve the accuracy in rice yield prediction under climate change conditions using integrated ML methods.

A single connection may be required to transfer several loads simultaneously so each one of those loads must be considered in the design. A good connection combines practicality and economy, which requires an understanding of several factors; including strength, serviceability, erection and economics. This research work focuses on the performance aspect of a specific type of beam-to-column connection using partly hidden corbel in precast concrete structures. In this study, the results of experimental assessment of the proposed beam-to-column connection in precast concrete frames was used. The purpose of this research is to develop and apply the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for moment-rotation prediction of precast beam-to-column connections. The ELM results are compared with genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN). The reliability of the computational models was accessed based on simulation results and using several statistical indicators.

Incorporating SF as a partial substitution of cement in concrete has obvious advantages, including reduced CO2 emission, cost-effective concrete, enhanced durability, and mechanical properties. Due to ever-increasing environmental concerns, the development of predictive machine learning (ML) models requires time. Therefore, the present study focuses on developing modeling techniques in predicting the compressive strength of silica fume concrete. The employed techniques include decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM). An extensive and reliable database of 283 compressive strengths was established from the available literature information. The six most influential factors, i.e., cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, water, superplasticizer, and silica fume, were considered as significant input parameters. The evaluation of models was performed by different statistical parameters, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), root mean squared log error (RMSLE), and coefficient of determination (R-2). Individual and ensemble models of DT and SVM showed satisfactory results with high prediction accuracy. Statistical analyses indicated that DT models bested SVM for predicting compressive strength. Ensemble modeling showed an enhancement of 11 percent and 1.5 percent for DT and SVM compressive strength models, respectively, as depicted by statistical parameters. Moreover, sensitivity analyses showed that cement and water are the governing parameters in developing compressive strength. A cross-validation technique was used to avoid overfitting issues and confirm the generalized modeling output. ML algorithms are used to predict SFC compressive strength to promote the use of green concrete.

Unifying machine learning and quantum chemistry with a deep neural network for molecular wavefunctions	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							BASIS-SETS	Machine learning advances chemistry and materials science by enabling large-scale exploration of chemical space based on quantum chemical calculations. While these models supply fast and accurate predictions of atomistic chemical properties, they do not explicitly capture the electronic degrees of freedom of a molecule, which limits their applicability for reactive chemistry and chemical analysis. Here we present a deep learning framework for the prediction of the quantum mechanical wavefunction in a local basis of atomic orbitals from which all other ground-state properties can be derived. This approach retains full access to the electronic structure via the wavefunction at force-field-like efficiency and captures quantum mechanics in an analytically differentiable representation. On several examples, we demonstrate that this opens promising avenues to perform inverse design of molecular structures for targeting electronic property optimisation and a clear path towards increased synergy of machine learning and quantum chemistry.

Distributed Machine Learning for Multiuser Mobile Edge Computing Systems	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Task analysis; Optimization; Energy consumption; Collaborative work; Mobile handsets; Bandwidth; Distance learning; Computational offloading; federated learning; resource allocation; task priority	DESIGN	In this paper, we investigate a distributed machine learning approach for a multiuser mobile edge computing (MEC) network in a cognitive eavesdropping environment, where multiple secondary devices (SDs) have some tasks with different priorities to be computed. The SDs can be allowed to use the wireless spectrum as long as the interference to the primary user is tolerated, and an eavesdropper in the network can overhear the confidential message from the SDs, which threatens the data offloading. For the considered system, we firstly present three optimization criteria, whereas criterion I aims to minimize the linear combination of latency and energy consumption, criterion II tries to minimize the latency under a constraint on the energy consumption, and criterion III is to minimize the energy consumption under a constraint on the latency. We then exploit a federated learning framework to solve these optimization problems, by optimizing the offloading ratio, bandwidth and computational capability allocation ratio. Simulation results are finally demonstrated to show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the system cost in terms of latency and energy consumption, and meanwhile ensure more bandwidth and computational capability allocated to the user with a higher taskpriority.

Second opinion needed: communicating uncertainty in medical machine learning	NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; RISK PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; CALIBRATION; MODELS	There is great excitement that medical artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine learning (ML) can be used to improve decision making at the patient level in a variety of healthcare settings. However, the quantification and communication of uncertainty for individual predictions is often neglected even though uncertainty estimates could lead to more principled decision-making and enable machine learning models to automatically or semi-automatically abstain on samples for which there is high uncertainty. In this article, we provide an overview of different approaches to uncertainty quantification and abstention for machine learning and highlight how these techniques could improve the safety and reliability of current ML systems being used in healthcare settings. Effective quantification and communication of uncertainty could help to engender trust with healthcare workers, while providing safeguards against known failure modes of current machine learning approaches. As machine learning becomes further integrated into healthcare environments, the ability to say "I'm not sure" or "I don't know" when uncertain is a necessary capability to enable safe clinical deployment.

However, the significant risk factors for SA in this population remains unclear - whether these factors are associated with the disorder itself or related to extrinsic factors, such as comorbidities and sociodemographic variables. This study aimed to identify predictors of SA in OCD patients using a machine learning algorithm. Methods A total of 959 outpatients with OCD were included. An elastic net model was performed to recognize the predictors of SA among OCD patients, using clinical and sociodemographic variables. Results The prevalence of SA in our sample was 10.8%. Relevant predictors of SA founded by the elastic net algorithm were the following: previous suicide planning, previous suicide thoughts, lifetime depressive episode, and intermittent explosive disorder. Our elastic net model had a good performance and found an area under the curve of 0.95. Conclusions This is the first study to evaluate risk factors for SA among OCD patients using machine learning algorithms. Our results demonstrate an accurate risk algorithm can be created using clinical and sociodemographic variables. All aspects of suicidal phenomena need to be carefully investigated by clinicians in every evaluation of OCD patients. Particular attention should be given to comorbidity with depressive symptoms.

Irrespective of the application, reliable real-time estimation of battery state of health (SOH) by on-board computers is crucial to the safe operation of the battery, ultimately safeguarding asset integrity. In this Article, we design and evaluate a machine learning pipeline for estimation of battery capacity fade-a metric of battery health-on 179 cells cycled under various conditions. The pipeline estimates battery SOH with an associated confidence interval by using two parametric and two non-parametric algorithms. Using segments of charge voltage and current curves, the pipeline engineers 30 features, performs automatic feature selection and calibrates the algorithms. When deployed on cells operated under the fast-charging protocol, the best model achieves a root-mean-squared error of 0.45%. This work provides insights into the design of scalable data-driven models for battery SOH estimation, emphasizing the value of confidence bounds around the prediction. The pipeline methodology combines experimental data with machine learning modelling and could be applied to other critical components that require real-time estimation of SOH. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries play a crucial role in many modern-day applications, including portable electronics and electric vehicles, but they degrade over time. To ensure safe operation, a battery's 'state of health' should be monitored in real time, and this machine learning pipeline, tested on a variety of charging conditions, can provide such an online estimation of battery state of health.

However, such simulations are notoriously challenging to perform with quantum mechanical methods. Advances in machine learning open many new avenues for assisting molecular excited-state simulations. In this Review, we track such progress, assess the current state of the art and highlight the critical issues to solve in the future. We overview a broad range of machine learning applications in excited-state research, which include the prediction of molecular properties, improvements of quantum mechanical methods for the calculations of excited-state properties and the search for new materials. Machine learning approaches can help us understand hidden factors that influence photo-processes, leading to a better control of such processes and new rules for the design of materials for optoelectronic applications.

Anatole			FCHL revisited: Faster and more accurate quantum machine learning	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; POTENTIALS	We introduce the FCHL19 representation for atomic environments in molecules or condensed-phase systems. Machine learning models based on FCHL19 are able to yield predictions of atomic forces and energies of query compounds with chemical accuracy on the scale of milliseconds. FCHL19 is a revision of our previous work [F. A. Faber et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241717 (2018)] where the representation is discretized and the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed phase for a set of water clusters with a mean absolute error (MAE) binding energy error of less than 0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3200 samples. For force learning on the MD 17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art accuracy with a regressor based on Gaussian process regression. When the revised FCHL19 representation is combined with the operator quantum machine learning regressor, forces and energies can be predicted in only a few milliseconds per atom. The model presented herein is fast and lightweight enough for use in general chemistry problems as well as molecular dynamics simulations.

The efficiency of the DLNN model was estimated for the Kon Tum Province, Viet Nam, an area characterized by the presence of landslide phenomena. Nine landslide related variables, elevation, slope angle, aspect, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, distance to faults, distance to geology boundaries, lithology cover, and 1,657 landslide locations, were used so as to produce the training and validation datasets during the landslide susceptibility assessment. The Frequency Ratio method was used so as to estimate the existing relation between the landslide-related variables and the presence of landslides, assigning to each variable class a weight value. Based on the results concerning the predictive ability of the landslide related variables which was evaluated using the Information ration method, all variables were further processed since they appear as highly predictive. The learning ability of the DLNN model has been evaluated and compared with a Multi Layer Preceptron Neural Network, a Support Vector Machine, a C4.5-Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model using the training dataset, whereas the predictive performance of each model has been evaluated and compared using the validation datascts. In order to evaluate their learning and predictive capacity of each model the classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC) were calculated. Results showed that the proposed DLNN model had a higher performance than the four benchmark models. Although DLNN has been used seldom in landslide susceptibility assessments, the study highlights that the usage of deep learning approach could be considered as a satisfactory alternative approach for landslide susceptibility mapping.

To the best of our knowledge, no machine learning (ML) approaches apart from logistic regression (LR) have ever been tried on this class of problems. Methods In this longitudinal study, patients with RA who started a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) in a tertiary care center were analyzed. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected at treatment baseline, 12-month, and 24-month follow-up. A wrapper feature selection algorithm was used to determine an attribute core set. Four different ML algorithms, namely, LR, random forest, K-nearest neighbors, and extreme gradient boosting, were then trained and validated with 10-fold cross-validation to predict 24-month sustained DAS28 (Disease Activity Score on 28 joints) remission. The performances of the algorithms were then compared assessing accuracy, precision, and recall. Results Our analysis included 367 patients (female 323/367, 88%) with mean age +/- SD of 53.7 +/- 12.5 years at bDMARD baseline. Sustained DAS28 remission was achieved by 175 (47.2%) of 367 patients. The attribute core set used to train algorithms included acute phase reactant levels, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, as well as several clinical characteristics. Extreme gradient boosting showed the best performance (accuracy, 72.7%; precision, 73.2%; recall, 68.1%), outperforming random forest (accuracy, 65.9%; precision, 65.6%; recall, 59.3%), LR (accuracy, 64.9%; precision, 62.6%; recall, 61.9%), and K-nearest neighbors (accuracy, 63%; precision, 61.5%; recall, 54.8%). Conclusions We showed that ML models can be used to predict sustained remission in RA patients on bDMARDs. Furthermore, our method only relies on a few easy-to-collect patient attributes. Our results are promising but need to be tested on longitudinal cohort studies.

Advanced data analysis approaches, such as machine learning (ML), have become indispensable tools for revealing hidden patterns or deducing correlations for which conventional analytical methods face limitations or challenges. However, ML concepts and practices have not been widely utilized by researchers in ESE. This feature explores the potential of ML to revolutionize data analysis and modeling in the ESE field, and covers the essential knowledge needed for such applications. First, we use five examples to illustrate how ML addresses complex ESE problems. We then summarize four major types of applications of ML in ESE: making predictions; extracting feature importance; detecting anomalies; and discovering new materials or chemicals. Next, we introduce the essential knowledge required and current shortcomings in ML applications in ESE, with a focus on three important but often overlooked components when applying ML: correct model development, proper model interpretation, and sound applicability analysis. Finally, we discuss challenges and future opportunities in the application of ML tools in ESE to highlight the potential of ML in this field.

Machine Learning in Computer-Aided Synthesis Planning	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							REACTION PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYNTHESIS DESIGN; CHEMISTRY; RETROSYNTHESIS; DISCOVERY; SYSTEM; TOOL	CONSPECTUS: Computer-aided synthesis planning (GASP) is focused on the goal of accelerating the process by which chemists decide how to synthesize small molecule compounds. The ideal CASP program would take a molecular structure as input and output a sorted list of detailed reaction schemes that each connect that target to purchasable starting materials via a series of chemically feasible reaction steps. Early work in this field relied on expert-crafted reaction rules and heuristics to describe possible retrosynthetic disconnections and selectivity rules but suffered from incompleteness, infeasible suggestions, and human bias. With the relatively recent availability of large reaction corpora (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Reaxys, and SciFinder databases), consisting of millions of tabulated reaction examples, it is now possible to construct and validate purely data-driven approaches to synthesis planning. As a result, synthesis planning has been opened to machine learning techniques, and the field is advancing rapidly. In this Account, we focus on two critical aspects of CASP and recent machine learning approaches to both challenges. First, we discuss the problem of retrosynthetic planning, which requires a recommender system to propose synthetic disconnections starting from a target molecule. We describe how the search strategy, necessary to overcome the exponential growth of the search space with increasing number of reaction steps, can be assisted through a learned synthetic complexity metric. We also describe how the recursive expansion can be performed by a straightforward nearest neighbor model that makes clever use of reaction data to generate high quality retrosynthetic disconnections. Second, we discuss the problem of anticipating the products of chemical reactions, which can be used to validate proposed reactions in a computer-generated synthesis plan (i.e., reduce false positives) to increase the likelihood of experimental success. While we introduce this task in the context of reaction validation, its utility extends to the prediction of side products and impurities, among other applications. We describe neural network-based approaches that we and others have developed for this forward prediction task that can be trained on previously published experimental data. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized a number of disciplines, not limited to image recognition, dictation, translation, content recommendation, advertising, and autonomous driving. While there is a rich history of using machine learning for structure-activity models in chemistry, it is only now that it is being successfully applied more broadly to organic synthesis and synthesis design. As reported in this Account, machine learning is rapidly transforming CASP, but there are several remaining challenges and opportunities, many pertaining to the availability and standardization of both data and evaluation metrics, which must be addressed by the community at large.

Given the massive amount of data generated daily, there is a need for even faster and more effective machine learning algorithms that can provide updated models for real-time applications and on-demand tools. This paper presents FEMa-a finite element machine classifier-for supervised learning problems, where each training sample is the center of a basis function, and the whole training set is modeled as a probabilistic manifold for classification purposes. FEMa has its theoretical basis in the finite element method, which is widely used for numeral analysis in engineering problems. It is shown FEMa is parameterless and has a quadratic complexity for both training and classification phases when basis functions are used that satisfy certain properties. The proposed classifier yields very competitive results when compared to some state-of-the-art supervised pattern recognition techniques.

A review on machine learning in 3D printing: applications, potential, and challenges	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Review						Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; 3D printing; In-situ monitoring; Additive manufacturing; Process optimization	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; PROCESS PARAMETERS; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; ANOMALY DETECTION; DEFECT DETECTION; MELT POOL; DESIGN; PREDICTION; PARTS	Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is growing rapidly in the manufacturing industry and has gained a lot of attention from various fields owing to its ability to fabricate parts with complex features. The reliability of the 3D printed parts has been the focus of the researchers to realize AM as an end-part production tool. Machine learning (ML) has been applied in various aspects of AM to improve the whole design and manufacturing workflow especially in the era of industry 4.0. In this review article, various types of ML techniques are first introduced. It is then followed by the discussion on their use in various aspects of AM such as design for 3D printing, material tuning, process optimization, in situ monitoring, cloud service, and cybersecurity. Potential applications in the biomedical, tissue engineering and building and construction will be highlighted. The challenges faced by ML in AM such as computational cost, standards for qualification and data acquisition techniques will also be discussed. In the authors' perspective, in situ monitoring of AM processes will significantly benefit from the object detection ability of ML. As a large data set is crucial for ML, data sharing of AM would enable faster adoption of ML in AM. Standards for the shared data are needed to facilitate easy sharing of data. The use of ML in AM will become more mature and widely adopted as better data acquisition techniques and more powerful computer chips for ML are developed.	[Goh, G. D.; Sing, S. L.; Yeong, W.

The binary classification process, such as malignant or benign is relatively trivial; whereas, the multimodal brain tumors classification (T1, T2, T1CE, and Flair) is a challenging task for radiologists. Here, we present an automated multimodal classification method using deep learning for brain tumor type classification. The proposed method consists of five core steps. In the first step, the linear contrast stretching is employed using edge-based histogram equalization and discrete cosine transform (DCT). In the second step, deep learning feature extraction is performed. By utilizing transfer learning, two pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models, namely VGG16 and VGG19, were used for feature extraction. In the third step, a correntropy-based joint learning approach was implemented along with the extreme learning machine (ELM) for the selection of best features. In the fourth step, the partial least square (PLS)-based robust covariant features were fused in one matrix. The combined matrix was fed to ELM for final classification. The proposed method was validated on the BraTS datasets and an accuracy of 97.8%, 96.9%, 92.5% for BraTs2015, BraTs2017, and BraTs2018, respectively, was achieved.

In vitro screening experiments (i.e. bioassays) are frequently used for this purpose; however, experimental approaches are insufficient to explore novel drug-target interactions, mainly because of feasibility problems, as they are labour intensive, costly and time consuming. A computational field known as 'virtual screening' (VS) has emerged in the past decades to aid experimental drug discovery studies by statistically estimating unknown bio-interactions between compounds and biological targets. These methods use the physico-chemical and structural properties of compounds and/or target proteins along with the experimentally verified bio-interaction information to generate predictive models. Lately, sophisticated machine learning techniques are applied in VS to elevate the predictive performance. The objective of this study is to examine and discuss the recent applications of machine learning techniques in VS, including deep learning, which became highly popular after giving rise to epochal developments in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. The past 3 years have witnessed an unprecedented amount of research studies considering the application of deep learning in biomedicine, including computational drug discovery. In this review, we first describe the main instruments of VS methods, including compound and protein features (i.e. representations and descriptors), frequently used libraries and toolkits for VS, bioactivity databases and gold-standard data sets for system training and benchmarking. We subsequently review recent VS studies with a strong emphasis on deep learning applications. Finally, we discuss the present state of the field, including the current challenges and suggest future directions. We believe that this survey will provide insight to the researchers working in the field of computational drug discovery in terms of comprehending and developing novel bio-prediction methods.

We conceptualize an entirely different approach to analyzing the risk profiles of supplier performance under uncertainty by utilizing the data analytics capabilities in digital manufacturing. Digital manufacturing peculiarly challenge the supplier selection by the dynamic order allocations, and opens new opportunities to exploit the digital data to improve sourcing decisions. We develop a hybrid technique, combining simulation and machine learning and examine its applications to data-driven decision-making support in resilient supplier selection. We consider on-time delivery as an indicator for supplier reliability, and explore the conditions surrounding the formation of resilient supply performance profiles. We theorize the notions of risk profile of supplier performance and resilient supply chain performance. We show that the associations of the deviations from the resilient supply chain performance profile with the risk profiles of supplier performance can be efficiently deciphered by our approach. The results suggest that a combination of supervised machine learning and simulation, if utilized properly, improves the delivery reliability. Our approach can also be of value when analyzing the supplier base and uncovering the critical suppliers, or combinations of suppliers the disruption of which result in the adverse performance decreases. The results of this study advance our understanding about how and when machine learning and simulation can be combined to create digital supply chain twins, and through these twins improve resilience. The proposed data-driven decision-making model for resilient supplier selection can be further exploited for design of risk mitigation strategies in supply chain disruption management models, re-designing the supplier base or investing in most important and risky suppliers.

Like the Word2vec models, wherevectors of closely related words are in dose proximity in the vector space, Mol2vec learns Vector representations of molecular,,Substructures that point in similar directions for chemically, related substructures. compounds can finally be encoded as vectors by summing the vectors of the individual substructures and, for instance, be fed into supervised machine learning approaches to predict compound properties:. The underlying substructure vector embeddings are obtained by training an unsupervised machine learning, approach on a so-Called Corpus of compounds that consists of all available chemical-matter. The resulting Mol2vec model is pretrained once, yields dense vector,representations, and overcomes drawbacks of common, compound feature, representations such:as sparseness and bit collisions: The prediction capabilities are demonstrated on several compound property and bioactivity data sets and compared with results-obtained for Morgan fingerprints as a reference Compound representation: Mol2vec can-be-easily combined with ProtVec, Which employs the same Word2vec concept on protein sequences, resulting in a proteochemometric approach that is alignment-independent and thus can also be easily used for proteins with low sequence similarities.

Machine learning and soil sciences: a review aided by machine learning tools	SOIL			English	Review							ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPATIAL PREDICTION; WATER-RETENTION; PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS; LAND-USE; SEMIARID RANGELANDS; TOPSOIL CARBON; TOTAL NITROGEN	The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last 10 years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, (b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous), and (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.

J	Schuld, M; Killoran, N				Schuld, Maria; Killoran, Nathan			Quantum Machine Learning in Feature Hilbert Spaces	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								A basic idea of quantum computing is surprisingly similar to that of kernel methods in machine learning, namely, to efficiently perform computations in an intractably large Hilbert space. In this Letter we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyze the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. The kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualize the working principle with two-dimensional minibenchmark datasets.

Ab initio methods, such as coupled-cluster, routinely produce much higher accuracy, but computational costs limit their application to small molecules. In this paper, we leverage machine learning to calculate coupled-cluster energies from DFT densities, reaching quantum chemical accuracy (errors below 1 kcal . mol(-1)) on test data. Moreover, density-based Delta -learning (learning only the correction to a standard DFT calculation, termed Delta -DFT ) significantly reduces the amount of training data required, particularly when molecular symmetries are included. The robustness of Delta -DFT is highlighted by correcting "on the fly" DFT-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of resorcinol (C6H4(OH)(2)) to obtain MD trajectories with coupled-cluster accuracy. We conclude, therefore, that Delta -DFT facilitates running gas-phase MD simulations with quantum chemical accuracy, even for strained geometries and conformer changes where standard DFT fails. High-level ab initio quantum chemical methods carry a high computational burden, thus limiting their applicability. Here, the authors employ machine learning to generate coupled-cluster energies and forces at chemical accuracy for geometry optimization and molecular dynamics from DFT densities.

Accelerating crystal structure prediction by machine-learning interatomic potentials with active learning	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; BORON; ALGORITHM	We propose a methodology for crystal structure prediction that is based on the evolutionary algorithm USPEX and the machine-learning interatomic potentials actively learning on-the-fly. Our methodology allows for an automated construction of an interatomic interaction model from scratch, replacing the expensive density functional theory (DFT) and giving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. Predicted low-energy structures are then tested on DFT, ensuring that our machine-learning model does not introduce any prediction error. We tested our methodology on prediction of crystal structures of carbon, high-pressure phases of sodium, and boron allotropes, including those that have more than 100 atoms in the primitive cell. All the the main allotropes have been reproduced, and a hitherto unknown 54-atom structure of boron has been predicted with very modest computational effort.

However, AM processing parameters are difficult to tune, since they can exert a huge impact on the printed microstructure and on the performance of the subsequent products. It is a difficult task to build a process-structure-property-performance (PSPP) relationship for AM using traditional numerical and analytical models. Today, the machine learning (ML) method has been demonstrated to be a valid way to perform complex pattern recognition and regression analysis without an explicit need to construct and solve the underlying physical models. Among ML algorithms, the neural network (NN) is the most widely used model due to the large dataset that is currently available, strong computational power, and sophisticated algorithm architecture. This paper overviews the progress of applying the NN algorithm to several aspects of the AM whole chain, including model design, in situ monitoring, and quality evaluation. Current challenges in applying NNs to AM and potential solutions for these problems are then outlined. Finally, future trends are proposed in order to provide an overall discussion of this interdisciplinary area. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

This model is a combination of the RSS method which is known as an efficient ensemble technique and the CART which is a state of the art classifier. The Luc Yen district of Yen Bai province, a prominent landslide prone area of Viet Nam, was selected for the model development. Performance of the RSSCART model was evaluated through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, statistical analysis methods, and the Chi Square test. Results were compared with other benchmark landslide models namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), single CART, Nave Bayes Trees (NBT), and Logistic Regression (LR). In the development of model, ten important landslide affecting factors related with geomorphology, geology and geo-environment were considered namely slope angles, elevation, slope aspect, curvature, lithology, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, and rainfall. Performance of the RSSCART model (AUC = 0.841) is the best compared with other popular landslide models namely SVM (0.835), single CART (0.822), NBT (0.821), and LR (0.723). These results indicate that performance of the RSSCART is a promising method for spatial landslide prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Perspectives of using machine learning in laser powder bed fusion for metal additive manufacturing	VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL PROTOTYPING			English	Review						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; powder bed fusion; selective laser melting; artificial intelligence; machine learning	BUILD ORIENTATION; COMPUTER VISION; MICROSTRUCTURE; FRAMEWORK; COMPONENTS; INDUSTRY; ALSI10MG; PARTS	The adoption of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) for metals by the industry has been limited despite the significant progress made in the development of the process chain. One of the key obstacles is the inconsistency of the parts obtained from L-PBF. Due to its complexity, there are many potential fluctuations that can occur within the process chain which can lead to quality inconsistency in L-PBF parts. Machine learning (ML) has the possibility to overcome this obstacle by utilising datasets obtained at various stages of the L-PBF process chain. In this perspective article, the integration of ML into the different stages of L-PBF process chain, which potentially lead to better quality control, is explored. Prior to L-PBF, ML can be used for part designs and file preparation. Then, ML algorithms can be applied in the process parameter optimisation and in situ monitoring. Finally, ML can also be integrated into the post-processing.	[Sing, S. L.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore Ctr 3D Printing, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Kuo, C. N.; Ho, C.

Study Design and Setting: We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017) and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for binary outcomes. Results: We included 71 of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72-3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5-563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3-6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68%) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52-0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34 (0.20-0.47) higher for ML. Conclusion: We found no evidence of superior performance of ML over LR. Improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to avoid the mechanical equipment damage caused by the sudden failure of rolling-element bearings, it is necessary to monitor the condition of bearing and predict its life. Therefore, a two-stage prediction method based on extreme learning machine is proposed to predict the remaining useful life of rolling-element bearings quickly and accurately. This method uses the relative root mean square value (RRMS) to divide the operation stage of the bearing into two stages: normal operation and degradation. Starting from the normal operation stage, according to the principle of univariate prediction, a feedback extreme learning machine model is constructed for real-time short-term prediction of bearing degradation trend. Once the predicted value shows that the bearing has entered the degradation stage, the sensitive features are selected as the input by correlation analysis, and the multi variable feedback extreme learning machine model, which takes into account the dual advantages of multivariable regression and small sample prediction, is constructed to predict the remaining useful life. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher short-term prediction accuracy and faster operation speed in the case of limited learning sample size. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A new methodological approach is here presented, based on the ensemble of artificial neural network, generalized boosting model and maximum entropy ML algorithms. Such approach has been tested in theMonterosso al Mare area, Cinque Terre National Park (Northern Italy), severely hit by landslides in October 2011, following an extraordinary precipitation event, which caused extensive damage at this World Heritage site. Thirteen predisposing factors were selected and assessed according to the main characteristics of the territory and through variance inflation factor, whilst a database made of 260 landslides was adopted. Four different Ensemble techniques were applied, after the averaging of 300 stand-alone methods, each one providing validation scores such as ROC (receiver operating characteristics)/AUC (area under curve) and true skill statistics (TSS). A further model performance evaluation was achieved by assessing the uncertainty through the computation of the coefficient of variation (CV). Ensemble modelling thus showed improved reliability, testified by the higher scores, by the low values of CV and finally by a general consistency between the four Ensemble models adopted. Therefore, the improved reliability of Ensemble modelling confirms the efficacy and suitability of the proposed approach for decision-makers in land management at local and regional scales.

Apart from classical rational design and directed evolution approaches, machine learning methods have been increasingly applied to find patterns in data that help predict protein structures, improve enzyme stability, solubility, and function, predict substrate specificity, and guide rational protein design. In this Perspective, we analyze the state of the art in databases and methods used for training and validating predictors in enzyme engineering. We discuss current limitations and challenges which the community is facing and recent advancements in experimental and theoretical methods that have the potential to address those challenges. We also present our view on possible future directions for developing the applications to the design of efficient biocatalysts.

Here, we report the development and testing of a machine-learning-based system that predicts the risk of hypoxaemia and provides explanations of the risk factors in real time during general anaesthesia. The system, which was trained on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries, improved the performance of anaesthesiologists by providing interpretable hypoxaemia risks and contributing factors. The explanations for the predictions are broadly consistent with the literature and with prior knowledge from anaesthesiologists. Our results suggest that if anaesthesiologists currently anticipate 15% of hypoxaemia events, with the assistance of this system they could anticipate 30%, a large portion of which may benefit from early intervention because they are associated with modifiable factors. The system can help improve the clinical understanding of hypoxaemia risk during anaesthesia care by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain characteristics of the patient or procedure.

Yet, the high complexity of the tasks associated with DR, combined with their use of large-scale data and the frequent need for near real-time decisions, means that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) - a branch of AI - have recently emerged as key technologies for enabling demand-side response. AI methods can be used to tackle various challenges, ranging from selecting the optimal set of consumers to respond, learning their attributes and preferences, dynamic pricing, scheduling and control of devices, learning how to incentivise participants in the DR schemes and how to reward them in a fair and economically efficient way. This work provides an overview of AI methods utilised for DR applications, based on a systematic review of over 160 papers, 40 companies and commercial initiatives, and 21 large-scale projects. The papers are classified with regards to both the AI/ML algorithm(s) used and the application area in energy DR. Next, commercial initiatives are presented (including both start-ups and established companies) and large-scale innovation projects, where AI methods have been used for energy DR. The paper concludes with a discussion of advantages and potential limitations of reviewed AI techniques for different DR tasks, and outlines directions for future research in this fast-growing area.

The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day. Machine Learning (ML) and Cloud Computing can be deployed very effectively to track the disease, predict growth of the epidemic and design strategies and policies to manage its spread. This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic. A data driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. Finally, we propose a set of research opportunities and setup grounds for further practical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We developed ML algorithms using tribological data available in the literature for predicting the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear-rate of self-lubricating aluminum graphite (Al/Gr) composites. We collected data on effects of material variables (graphite content, hardness, ductility, yield strength, silicon carbide content, and tensile strength), processing procedure, heat treatment and tribological test variables (normal load, sliding speed, and sliding distance) on tribological properties and established two-parameter relationships. These data are analyzed using several ML algorithms: artificial neural network (ANN), K nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and random forest (RF). The trained ML models can predict the tribological behavior from material variables and test conditions, beyond what is possible from two-parameter correlations. GBM outperformed other ML algorithms in predicting friction behavior, while RF had the best prediction of the wear behavior. ML analysis identified graphite content and hardness and as the most significant variables in predicting the COF, while graphite content and sliding speed were the most dominant variables for wear-rates.

Early and accurate screening of breast tumours can improve survival. Ultrasound elastography is a non-invasive and non-ionizing imaging approach to characterize lesions for breast cancer screening, while machine learning techniques could improve the accuracy and reliability of computer-aided diagnosis. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art development and application of the machine learning model in breast tumour classification. Ultrasound elastography can quantify stiffness distribution of tissue lesions and complements conventional B-mode ultrasound for breast cancer screening. Recently, the development of computer-aided diagnosis has improved the reliability of the system, whilst the inception of machine learning, such as deep learning, has further extended its power by facilitating automated segmentation and tumour classification. The objective of this review was to summarize application of the machine learning model to ultrasound elastography systems for breast tumour classification. Review databases included PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Thirteen (n = 13) articles were eligible for review. Shear-wave elastography was investigated in six articles, whereas seven studies focused on strain elastography (5 freehand and 2 Acoustic Radiation Force). Traditional computer vision workflow was common in strain elastography with separated image segmentation, feature extraction, and classifier functions using different algorithm-based methods, neural networks or support vector machines (SVM). Shear-wave elastography often adopts the deep learning model, convolutional neural network (CNN), that integrates functional tasks. All of the reviewed articles achieved sensitivity >= 80%, while only half of them attained acceptable specificity >= 95%. Deep learning models did not necessarily perform better than traditional computer vision workflow. Nevertheless, there were inconsistencies and insufficiencies in reporting and calculation, such as the testing dataset, cross-validation, and methods to avoid overfitting. Most of the studies did not report loss or hyperparameters. Future studies may consider using the deep network with an attention layer to locate the targeted object automatically and online training to facilitate efficient re-training for sequential data.

The parameters in the model have an important influence on the performance of KELM. Therefore, model parameters must be properly adjusted before they can be put into practical use. This study proposes a new parameter learning strategy based on an improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) strategy, in which a new hierarchical mechanism was established to improve the stochastic behavior, and exploration capability of grey wolves. In the proposed mechanism, random local search around the optimal grey wolf was introduced in Beta grey wolves, and random global search was introduced in Omega grey wolves. The effectiveness of IGWO strategy is first validated on 10 commonly used benchmark functions. Results have shown that the proposed IGWO can find good balance between exploration and exploitation. In addition, when IGWO is applied to solve the parameter adjustment problem of KELM model, it also provides better performance than other seven meta-heuristic algorithms in three practical applications, including students' second major selection, thyroid cancer diagnosis and financial stress prediction. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can serve as a good candidate tool for tuning the parameters of KELM, thus enabling the KELM model to achieve more promising results in practical applications.

Notwithstanding the impressive performance of ML/DL, there are still lingering doubts regarding the robustness of ML/DL in healthcare settings (which is traditionally considered quite challenging due to the myriad security and privacy issues involved), especially in light of recent results that have shown that ML/DL are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present an overview of various application areas in healthcare that leverage such techniques from security and privacy point of view and present associated challenges. In addition, we present potential methods to ensure secure and privacy-preserving ML for healthcare applications. Finally, we provide insight into the current research challenges and promising directions for future research.

However, BFO suffers from multiple drawbacks, including slow convergence speed, inability to jump out of local optima and fixed step length. In this study, an enhanced BFO with chaotic chemotaxis step length, Gaussian mutation and chaotic local search (CCGBFO) is proposed for overcoming the existing weakness of original BFO. First, a chaotic chemotaxis step length operation is used to produce adaptive chemotaxis step length. Then, by combining the optimal position in the current bacteria with the Gaussian mutation operation to make full use of the information of the optimal position. Finally, a chaotic local search is introduced into the chemotaxis step to ensure that the algorithm can explore a large search space in the early stage. The performance of CCGBFO was evaluated on a comprehensive set of numerical benchmark functions including IEEE CEC2014 and CEC2017 problems. In addition, CCGBFO was also used to tune the key parameters of kernel extreme learning machine for dealing with the real-world problems. The experimental results show that the proposed CCGBFO significantly outperforms the original BFO in terms of both convergence speed and solution accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we investigate the potential of a scientific processor designed to quantify biophysical and biochemical crop traits from spectroscopic imagery of the upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite. Said processor relies on a hybrid retrieval workflow executing pre-trained machine learning regression models fast and efficiently based on training data from a lookup table of synthetic vegetation spectra and their associated parameterization of the well-known radiative transfer model (RTM) PROSAIL. The established models provide spatial information about leaf area index (LAI), average leaf inclination angle (ALIA), leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) and leaf mass per area (C-m). In contrast to using site-specific training data, the approach facilitates a universal application without the need to integrate a priori information into the processor. Four machine learning algorithms, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were found to estimate biophysical and biochemical variables of unseen targets with high performance (relative error scores < 10%). ANNs excelled in terms of accuracy, model size and execution time when the 242 spectral bands were transformed into 15 principal components, the signals of which were scaled by a z-transformation. Validation using in situ data from the SPARC03 Barrax campaign dataset revealed an overall good estimation of measured functional traits, for instance for LAI with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.81 m(2) m(-2), and for C-ab RMSE of 6.2 mu g cm(-2) with the ANN model. Moreover, both crop traits could be successfully mapped using a pseudo-EnMAP scene revealing plausible within-field patterns. Conformity with LAI output of the SNAP biophysical processor was found especially for grassland and maize in the vegetative stages. Based on these findings, ANN models are considered the best choice for implementation of a hybrid retrieval workflow within the context of operational agricultural crop traits monitoring from future satellite imaging spectroscopy.

J	Camporeale, E				Camporeale, E.			The Challenge of Machine Learning in Space Weather: Nowcasting and Forecasting	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORK PREDICTION; SOLAR-WIND DATA; COMMUNITY-WIDE VALIDATION; RADIATION BELT ELECTRONS; CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS; GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT; GEOMAGNETIC-ACTIVITY; DST INDEX	The numerous recent breakthroughs in machine learning make imperative to carefully ponder how the scientific community can benefit from a technology that, although not necessarily new, is today living its golden age. This Grand Challenge review paper is focused on the present and future role of machine learning in Space Weather. The purpose is twofold. On one hand, we will discuss previous works that use machine learning for Space Weather forecasting, focusing in particular on the few areas that have seen most activity: the forecasting of geomagnetic indices, of relativistic electrons at geosynchronous orbits, of solar flares occurrence, of coronal mass ejection propagation time, and of solar wind speed. On the other hand, this paper serves as a gentle introduction to the field of machine learning tailored to the Space Weather community and as a pointer to a number of open challenges that we believe the community should undertake in the next decade. The recurring themes throughout the review are the need to shift our forecasting paradigm to a probabilistic approach focused on the reliable assessment of uncertainties, and the combination of physics-based and machine learning approaches, known as gray box. Plain Language Summary In the last decade, machine learning has achieved unforeseen results in industrial applications. In particular, the combination of massive data sets and computing with specialized processors (graphics processing units, or GPUs) can perform as well or better than humans in tasks like image classification and game playing. Space weather is a discipline that lives between academia and industry, given the relevant physical effects on satellites and power grids in a variety of applications, and the field therefore stands to benefit from the advances made in industrial applications. Today, machine learning poses both a challenge and an opportunity for the space weather community. The challenge is that the current data science revolution has not been fully embraced, possibly because space physicists remain skeptical of the gains achievable with machine learning. If the community can master the relevant technical skills, they should be able to appreciate what is possible within a few years time and what is possible within a decade. The clearest opportunity lies in creating space weather forecasting models that can respond in real time and that are built on both physics predictions and on observed data.

However, there is, now, cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In this article, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, that is, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.

Over the past few decades, a natural disaster has accelerated its occurrence, which has significantly impacted agricultural systems, economies, environments, water resources, and supplies. Therefore, it is essential to develop new techniques that enable comprehensive determination and observations of droughts over large areas with satisfactory spatial and temporal resolution. This study modeled a new drought index called the Combined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI), developed in the Ganga river basin. For this, five Machine Learning (ML) techniques, derived from artificial intelligence theories, were applied: the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, decision trees, Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression, boosted trees, and bagged trees. These techniques were driven by twelve different models generated from input combinations of satellite data and hydrometeorological parameters. The results indicated that the eighth model performed best and was superior among all the models, with the SVM algorithm resulting in an R-2 value of 0.82 and the lowest errors in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.33) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (0.20), followed by the Matern 5/2 Gaussian model with an R-2 value of 0.75 and RMSE and MAE of 0.39 and 0.21 mm/day, respectively. Moreover, among all the five methods, the SVM and Matern 5/2 Gaussian methods were the best-performing ML algorithms in our study of CTEI predictions for the Ganga basin.

Here, we experimentally report a real-time digital-metasurface imager that can be trained in-situ to generate the radiation patterns required by machine-learning optimized measurement modes. This imager is electronically reprogrammed in real time to access the optimized solution for an entire data set, realizing storage and transfer of full-resolution raw data in dynamically varying scenes. High-accuracy image coding and recognition are demonstrated in situ for various image sets, including handwritten digits and through-wall body gestures, using a single physical hardware imager, reprogrammed in real time. Our electronically controlled metasurface imager opens new venues for intelligent surveillance, fast data acquisition and processing, imaging at various frequencies, and beyond.

Two machine learning models are developed, namely, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the hybrid downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale (DSC/MS) models. These machine learning models are applied to a two-dimensional cylinder wake as a preliminary test and show remarkable ability to reconstruct laminar flow from low-resolution flow field data. We further assess the performance of these models for two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence. The CNN and DSC/MS models are found to reconstruct turbulent flows from extremely coarse flow field images with remarkable accuracy. For the turbulent flow problem, the machine-leaning-based super-resolution analysis can greatly enhance the spatial resolution with as little as 50 training snapshot data, holding great potential to reveal subgrid-scale physics of complex turbulent flows. With the growing availability of flow field data from high-fidelity simulations and experiments, the present approach motivates the development of effective super-resolution models for a variety of fluid flows.

Being the leading contributors to climate change, these economies are also at the core of environmental solutions. This paper investigates the causal relationship among solar and wind energy production, coal consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions for these three countries. To do so, we use an advanced methodology in Machine Learning to verify the predictive causal linkages among variables. The Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm set CO2 emissions as the target variable. The obtained results were disaggregated and estimated in a supervised prediction model. The findings, confirmed by three different Machine Learning procedures, showed an interesting output. While a reduction in overall carbon emissions is predicted in China and the US (resulting from the intensive use of renewable sources of energy), India displays critical predictions of a rise in CO2 emissions. This indicates that curbing CO2 emissions cannot be achieved without conducting a comprehensive shift from fossil to renewable resources, although China and the U.S. present a more promising path to sustainability than India. Being an emerging renewable energy leader, India should further enhance the use of low-carbon sources in its power supply and limit its dependence on coal. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this sense, it was emphasized that by the representation for the role of ML models and IoT relevant technologies in smart hospital environment. The accuracy rate of diagnosis (classification) based on laboratory findings can be improved via light ML models. Three ML models, namely, naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were trained and tested on the basis of laboratory datasets. Three main methodological scenarios of COVID-19 diagnoses, such as diagnoses based on original and normalized datasets and those based on feature selection, were presented. Compared with benchmark studies, our proposed SVM model obtained the most substantial diagnosis performance (up to 95%). The proposed model based on ML and IoT can be served as a clinical decision support system. Furthermore, the outcomes could reduce the workload for doctors, tackle the issue of patient overcrowding, and reduce mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal degeneration and the heterogeneity of the patient population present massive challenges to the development of early diagnostic tools and effective treatments for these diseases. Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, is enabling scientists, clinicians and patients to address some of these challenges. In this Review, we discuss how machine learning can aid early diagnosis and interpretation of medical images as well as the discovery and development of new therapies. A unifying theme of the different applications of machine learning is the integration of multiple high-dimensional sources of data, which all provide a different view on disease, and the automated derivation of actionable insights.

For this purpose, numerous machine-learning (ML) technique models are presented by many researchers to block malicious traffic flows in the IoT network. However, due to the inappropriate feature selection, several ML models prone misclassify mostly malicious traffic flows. Nevertheless, the significant problem still needs to be studied more in-depth that is how to select effective features for accurate malicious traffic detection in the IoT network. To address the problem, a new framework model is proposed. First, a novel feature selection metric approach named CorrAUC is proposed, and then based on CorrAUC, a new feature selection algorithm named CorrAUC is developed and designed, which is based on the wrapper technique to filter the features accurately and select effective features for the selected ML algorithm by using the area under the curve (AUC) metric. Then, we applied the integrated TOPSIS and Shannon entropy based on a bijective soft set to validate selected features for malicious traffic identification in the IoT network. We evaluate our proposed approach by using the Bot-IoT data set and four different ML algorithms. The experimental results analysis showed that our proposed method is efficient and can achieve >96% results on average.

J	Guo, L; Lei, YG; Xing, SB; Yan, T; Li, NP				Guo, Liang; Lei, Yaguo; Xing, Saibo; Yan, Tao; Li, Naipeng			Deep Convolutional Transfer Learning Network: A New Method for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of Machines With Unlabeled Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Bearing; convolutional neural network (CNN); intelligent fault diagnosis; transfer learning	FEATURE-SELECTION	The success of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines relies on the following two conditions: 1) labeled data with fault information are available; and 2) the training and testing data are drawn from the same probability distribution. However, for some machines, it is difficult to obtain massive labeled data. Moreover, even though labeled data can be obtained from some machines, the intelligent fault diagnosis method trained with such labeled data possibly fails in classifying unlabeled data acquired from the other machines due to data distribution discrepancy. These problems limit the successful applications of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines with unlabeled data. As a potential tool, transfer learning adapts a model trained in a source domain to its application in a target domain. Based on the transfer learning, we propose a new intelligent method named deep convolutional transfer learning network (DCTLN). A DCTLN consists of two modules: condition recognition and domain adaptation. The condition recognition module is constructed by a one-dimensional (1-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn features and recognize health conditions of machines. The domain adaptation module facilitates the 1-D CNN to learn domain-invariant features by maximizing domain recognition errors and minimizing the probability distribution distance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using six transfer fault diagnosis experiments.

This review introduces the machine learning algorithms as applied to medical image analysis, focusing on convolutional neural networks, and emphasizing clinical aspects of the field. The advantage of machine learning in an era of medical big data is that significant hierarchal relationships within the data can be discovered algorithmically without laborious hand-crafting of features. We cover key research areas and applications of medical image classification, localization, detection, segmentation, and registration. We conclude by discussing research obstacles, emerging trends, and possible future directions.

J	Zhou, ZH				Zhou, Zhi-Hua			A brief introduction to weakly supervised learning	NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW			English	Review						machine learning; weakly supervised learning; supervised learning	INSTANCE; CLASSIFICATION; NOISE	Supervised learning techniques construct predictive models by learning from a large number of training examples, where each training example has a label indicating its ground-truth output. Though current techniques have achieved great success, it is noteworthy that in many tasks it is difficult to get strong supervision information like fully ground-truth labels due to the high cost of the data-labeling process. Thus, it is desirable for machine-learning techniques to work with weak supervision. This article reviews some research progress of weakly supervised learning, focusing on three typical types of weak supervision: incomplete supervision, where only a subset of training data is given with labels; inexact supervision, where the training data are given with only coarse-grained labels; and inaccurate supervision, where the given labels are not always ground-truth.

Most standard mapping methods require expert knowledge, supervision and fieldwork. In this study, we use optical data from the Rapid Eye satellite and topographic factors to analyze the potential of machine learning methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), and different deep-learning convolution neural networks (CNNs) for landslide detection. We use two training zones and one test zone to independently evaluate the performance of different methods in the highly landslide-prone Rasuwa district in Nepal. Twenty different maps are created using ANN, SVM and RF and different CNN instantiations and are compared against the results of extensive fieldwork through a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) and other common metrics. This accuracy assessment yields the best result of 78.26% mIOU for a small window size CNN, which uses spectral information only. The additional information from a 5 m digital elevation model helps to discriminate between human settlements and landslides but does not improve the overall classification accuracy. CNNs do not automatically outperform ANN, SVM and RF, although this is sometimes claimed. Rather, the performance of CNNs strongly depends on their design, i.e., layer depth, input window sizes and training strategies. Here, we conclude that the CNN method is still in its infancy as most researchers will either use predefined parameters in solutions like Google TensorFlow or will apply different settings in a trial-and-error manner. Nevertheless, deep-learning can improve landslide mapping in the future if the effects of the different designs are better understood, enough training samples exist, and the effects of augmentation strategies to artificially increase the number of existing samples are better understood.

Thus, alternative energy sources based on renewable energy have been a major focus nowadays to meet the world's energy demand and at the same time to reduce global warming. Among these energy sources, solar energy is a major source of alternative energy that is used to generate electricity through photovoltaic (PV) system. However, the performance of the power generated is highly sensitive on climate and seasonal factors. The unpredictable behaviour of the climate affects the power output and causes an unfavourable impact on the stability, reliability and operation of the grid. Thus an accurate forecasting of PV output is a crucial requirement to ensure the stability and reliability of the grid. This study provides a systematic and critical review on the methods used to forecast PV power output with main focus on the metaheuristic and machine learning methods. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are summarised, based on historical data along with forecasting horizons and input parameters. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between machine learning and metaheuristic methods is compiled to assist researchers in choosing the best forecasting technique for future research.

J	Mandal, K; Saha, S; Mandal, S				Mandal, Kanu; Saha, Sunil; Mandal, Sujit			Applying deep learning and benchmark machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility modelling in Rorachu river basin of Sikkim Himalaya, India	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS			English	Article						Machine learning techniques; Information gain ratio (IGR); Landslide susceptibility map (LSM); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Receiver operating characteristics (ROC)	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION LR; DECISION TREE; HYBRID INTEGRATION; SPATIAL PREDICTION; STATISTICAL INDEX; AREA; GIS; CLASSIFICATION; HAZARD	Landslide is considered as one of the most severe threats to human life and property in the hilly areas of the world. The number of landslides and the level of damage across the globe has been increasing over time. Therefore, landslide management is essential to maintain the natural and socio-economic dynamics of the hilly region. Rorachu river basin is one of the most landslide-prone areas of the Sikkim selected for the present study. The prime goal of the study is to prepare landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) using computer-based advanced machine learning techniques and compare the performance of the models. To properly understand the existing spatial relation with the landslide, twenty factors, including triggering and causative factors, were selected. A deep learning algorithm viz. convolutional neural network model (CNN) and three popular machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest model (RF), artificial neural network model (ANN), and bagging model, were employed to prepare the LSMs. Two separate datasets including training and validation were designed by randomly taken landslide and non-landslide points. A ratio of 70:30 was considered for the selection of both training and validation points. Multicollinearity was assessed by tolerance and variance inflation factor, and the role of individual conditioning factors was estimated using information gain ratio. The result reveals that there is no severe multicollinearity among the landslide conditioning factors, and the triggering factor rainfall appeared as the leading cause of the landslide. Based on the final prediction values of each model, LSM was constructed and successfully portioned into five distinct classes, like very low, low, moderate, high, and very high susceptibility. The susceptibility class-wise distribution of landslides shows that more than 90% of the landslide area falls under higher landslide susceptibility grades. The precision of models was examined using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and statistical methods like root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). In both datasets (training and validation), the CNN model achieved the maximum AUC value of 0.903 and 0.939, respectively. The lowest value of RMSE and MAE also reveals the better performance of the CNN model. So, it can be concluded that all the models have performed well, but the CNN model has outperformed the other models in terms of precision.

Thermophysical properties of nanofluids play a crucial role in their thermal behavior. Among various properties, the dynamic viscosity is one of the most crucial ones due to its impact on fluid motion and friction. Applying appropriate models can facilitate the design of nanofluidics thermal devices. In the present study, various machine learning methods including MPR, MARS, ANN-MLP, GMDH, and M5-tree are used for modeling the dynamic viscosity of CuO/water nanofluid based on the temperature, concentration, and size of nanostructures. The input data are extracted from various experimental studies to propose a comprehensive model, applicable in wide ranges of input variables. Moreover, the relative importance of each variable is evaluated to figure out the priority of the variables and their influences on the dynamic viscosity. Finally, the accuracy of the models is compared by employing the statistical criteria such as R-squared value. The models' outputs disclosed that employing ANN-MLP approach leads to the most precise model. R-square value and average absolute percent relative error (AAPR) value of the model by using ANN-MLP model are 0.9997 and 1.312%, respectively. According to these values, ANN-MLP is a reliable approach for predicting the dynamic viscosity of the studied nanofluid. Additionally, based on the relative importance of the input variables, it is concluded that concentration has the highest relative importance; while the influence of size is the lowest one.

NN forecasts based on macroeconomic and yield information translate into economic gains that are larger than those obtained using yields alone. Interestingly, the nature of unspanned factors changes along the yield curve: stock- and labor-market-related variables are more relevant for shortterm maturities, whereas output and income variables matter more for longer maturities. Finally, NN forecasts correlate with proxies for time-varying risk aversion and uncertainty, lending support to models featuring both channels.

In particular for the nanostructured materials, the experimental measurement of thermal conductivity is associated with diverse sources of uncertainty. As a viable alternative to experiment, the combination of density functional theory (DFT) simulations and the solution of Boltzmann transport equation is currently considered as the most trusted approach to examine thermal conductivity. The main bottleneck of the aforementioned method is to acquire the anharmonic interatomic force constants using the computationally demanding DFT calculations. In this work we propose a substantially accelerated approach for the evaluation of anharmonic interatomic force constants via employing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained over short ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The remarkable accuracy of the proposed accelerated method is confirmed by comparing the estimated thermal conductivities of several bulk and two-dimensional materials with those computed by the full-DFT approach. The MLIP-based method proposed in this study can be employed as a standard tool, which would substantially accelerate and facilitate the estimation of lattice thermal conductivity in comparison with the commonly used full-DFT solution.

However, the continuous increase of the number of smart devices results in privacy leakage and insufficient model accuracy of edge services. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we propose a blockchain-based machine learning framework for edge services (BML-ES) in IIoT. Specifically, we construct novel smart contracts to encourage multiparty participation of edge services to improve the efficiency of data processing. Moreover, we propose an aggregation strategy to verify and aggregate model parameters to ensure the accuracy of decision tree models. Finally, based on the SM2 public key cryptosystem, we protect data security and prevent data privacy leakage in edge services. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments indicate that the BML-ES framework is secure, effective, and efficient, and is better suitable to improve the accuracy of edge services in IIoT.

In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China's most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards.

J	Neuville, R; Bates, JS; Jonard, F				Neuville, Romain; Bates, Jordan Steven; Jonard, Francois			Estimating Forest Structure from UAV-Mounted LiDAR Point Cloud Using Machine Learning	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						UAV; LiDAR; point cloud; machine learning; HDBSCAN; PCA; tree stem segmentation; tree diameter		Monitoring the structure of forest stands is of high importance for forest managers to help them in maintaining ecosystem services. For that purpose, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) open new prospects, especially in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology. Indeed, the shorter distance from the Earth's surface significantly increases the point density beneath the canopy, thus offering new possibilities for the extraction of the underlying semantics. For example, tree stems can now be captured with sufficient detail, which is a gateway to accurately locating trees and directly retrieving metrics-e.g., the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). Current practices usually require numerous site-specific parameters, which may preclude their use when applied beyond their initial application context. To overcome this shortcoming, the machine learning Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application of Noise (HDBSCAN) clustering algorithm was further improved and implemented to segment tree stems. Afterwards, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to extract tree stem orientation for subsequent DBH estimation. This workflow was then validated using LiDAR point clouds collected in a temperate deciduous closed-canopy forest stand during the leaf-on and leaf-off seasons, along with multiple scanning angle ranges. The results show that the proposed methodology can correctly detect up to 82% of tree stems (with a precision of 98%) during the leaf-off season and have a Maximum Scanning Angle Range (MSAR) of 75 degrees, without having to set up any site-specific parameters for the segmentation procedure. In the future, our method could then minimize the omission and commission errors when initially detecting trees, along with assisting further tree metrics retrieval. Finally, this research shows that, under the study conditions, the point density within an approximately 1.3-meter height above the ground remains low within closed-canopy forest stands even during the leaf-off season, thus restricting the accurate estimation of the DBH. As a result, autonomous UAVs that can both fly above and under the canopy provide a clear opportunity to achieve this purpose.

However, studies are limited regarding lncRNAs correlated with recurrence and fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) in stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods 1640 stage II/III CRC patients were enrolled from 15 independent datasets and a clinical in-house cohort. 10 prevalent machine learning algorithms were collected and then combined into 76 combinations. 109 published transcriptome signatures were also retrieved. qRT-PCR assay was performed to verify our model. Findings We comprehensively identified 27 stably recurrence-related lncRNAs from multi-center cohorts. According to these lncRNAs, a consensus machine learning-derived lncRNA signature (CMDLncS) that exhibited best power for predicting recurrence risk was determined from 76 kinds of algorithm combinations. A high CMDLncS indicated unfavorable recurrence and mortality rates. CMDLncS not only could work independently of common clinical traits (e.g., AJCC stage) and molecular features (e.g., microsatellite state, KRAS mutation), but also presented dramatically better performance than these variables. qRT-PCR results from 173 patients further verified our in-silico findings and assessed its feasible in different centers. Comparisons of CMDLncS with 109 published transcriptome signatures further demonstrated its predictive superiority. Additionally, patients with high CMDLncS benefited more from fluorouracil-based ACT and were characterized by activation of stromal and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, while patients with low CMDLncS suggested the sensitivity to bevacizumab and displayed enhanced immune activation. Interpretation CMDLncS provides an attractive platform for identifying patient at high risk of recurrence and could optimize precision treatment to improve the clinical outcomes in stage II/III CRC.

The traditional modelling methodologies are dependent on datasets that involve large amount of unknown or unspecified input data and generally consist of time-consuming processes. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a flexible mathematical structure that has the capability to identify non-linear and complex relationships between input and output data. There has been a major degradation of the Johor River Basin because of several developmental and human activities. Therefore, setting up of a water quality prediction model for better water resource management is of critical importance and will serve as a powerful tool. The different modelling approaches that have been implemented include: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-ANN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). However, data obtained from monitoring stations and experiments are possibly polluted by noise signals as a result of random and systematic errors. Due to the presence of noise in the data, it is relatively difficult to make an accurate prediction. Hence, a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WDT-ANFIS) based augmented wavelet de-noising technique has been recommended that depends on historical data of the water quality parameter. In the domain of interests, the water quality parameters primarily include ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), suspended solid (SS) and pH. In order to evaluate the impacts on the model, three evaluation techniques or assessment processes have been used. The first assessment process is dependent on the partitioning of the neural network connection weights that ascertains the significance of every input parameter in the network. On the other hand, the second and third assessment processes ascertain the most effectual input that has the potential to construct the models using a single and a combination of parameters, respectively. During these processes, two scenarios were introduced: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. Scenario 1 constructs a prediction model for water quality parameters at every station, while Scenario 2 develops a prediction model on the basis of the value of the same parameter at the previous station (upstream). Both the scenarios are based on the value of the twelve input parameters. The field data from 2009 to 2010 was used to validate WDT-ANFIS. The WDT-ANFIS model exhibited a significant improvement in predicting accuracy for all the water quality parameters and outperformed all the recommended models. Also, the performance of Scenario 2 was observed to be more adequate than Scenario 1, with substantial improvement in the range of 0.5% to 5% for all the water quality parameters at all stations. On validating the recommended model, it was found that the model satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters (R-2 values equal or bigger than 0.9).

However, to develop more efficient learning techniques, better understanding of the work done on Alzheimer's is needed. Here, we provide a review on 165 papers from 2005 to 2019, using various feature extraction and machine learning techniques. The machine learning techniques are surveyed under three main categories: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and deep learning (DL) and ensemble methods. We present a detailed review on these three approaches for Alzheimer's with possible future directions.	[Tanveer, M.; Richhariya, B.; Khan, R. U.; Rashid, A.

In the field of energy storage, machine learning has recently emerged as a promising modelling approach to determine the state of charge, state of health and remaining useful life of batteries. First, we review the two most studied types of battery models in the literature for battery state prediction: the equivalent circuit and physics-based models. Based on the current limitations of these models, we showcase the promise of various machine learning techniques for fast and accurate battery state prediction. Finally, we highlight the major challenges involved, especially in accurate modelling over length and time, performing in situ calculations and high-throughput data generation. Overall, this work provides insights into real-time, explainable machine learning for battery production, management and optimization in the future. Predicting the properties of batteries, such as their state of charge and remaining lifetime, is crucial for improving battery manufacturing, usage and optimisation for energy storage. The authors discuss how machine learning methods and high-throughput experimentation provide a data-driven approach to this problem, and highlight challenges in building models which provide fast and accurate battery state predictions.

This research proposes two machine learning models for the prediction of food production. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods are used to advance the prediction models. In the present study, two variables of livestock production and agricultural production were considered as the source of food production. Three variables were used to evaluate livestock production, namely livestock yield, live animals, and animal slaughtered, and two variables were used to assess agricultural production, namely agricultural production yields and losses. Iran was selected as the case study of the current study. Therefore, time-series data related to livestock and agricultural productions in Iran from 1961 to 2017 have been collected from the FAOSTAT database. First, 70% of this data was used to train ANFIS and MLP, and the remaining 30% of the data was used to test the models. The results disclosed that the ANFIS model with generalized bell-shaped (Gbell) built-in membership functions has the lowest error level in predicting food production. The findings of this study provide a suitable tool for policymakers who can use this model and predict the future of food production to provide a proper plan for the future of food security and food supply for the next generations.

Five artificial intelligence (AI) models based onmachine and deep learning techniques-back-propagation neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM), long-short term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)-are used. Five geological and nine operational parameters that influence the advancing speed are considered. A field case of shield tunnelling in Shenzhen City, China is analyzed using the developed models. A total of 1000 field datasets are adopted to establish intelligent models. The prediction performance of the five models is ranked as GRU > LSTM > SVM > ELM > BPNN. Moreover, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is adopted for sensitivity analysis. The results reveal that the main thrust (MT), penetration (P), foam volume (FV), and grouting volume (GV) have strong correlations with advancing speed (AS). An empirical formula is constructed based on the high-correlation influential factors and their corresponding field datasets. Finally, the prediction performances of the intelligent models and the empirical method are compared. The results reveal that all the intelligent models perform better than the empirical method.

HBP can also selectively and non-covalently interact with hormone. Therefore, accurate identification of HBP is an important prerequisite for understanding its biological functions and molecular mechanisms. Since experimental methods are still labor intensive and cost ineffective to identify HBP, it's necessary to develop computational methods to accurately and efficiently identify HBP. In this paper, a machine learning-based method was proposed to identify HBP, in which the samples were encoded by using the optimal tripeptide composition obtained based on the binomial distribution method. In the 5-fold cross-validation test, the proposed method yielded an overall accuracy of 97.15%. For the convenience of scientific community, a user-friendly webserver called HBPred2.0 was built, which could be freely accessed at http://lin-group.cn/server/HBPred2.0/.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses a hierarchical recombination of features to extract pertinent information and then learn the patterns represented in the data. Over the last eight years, its abilities have increasingly been applied to a wide variety of chemical challenges, from improving computational chemistry to drug and materials design and even synthesis planning. This review aims to explain the concepts of deep learning to chemists from any background and follows this with an overview of the diverse applications demonstrated in the literature. We hope that this will empower the broader chemical community to engage with this burgeoning field and foster the growing movement of deep learning accelerated chemistry.

J	Agbulut, U; Gurel, AE; Sandemir, S				Agbulut, Umit; Gurel, Ali Etem; Sandemir, Suat			Experimental investigation and prediction of performance and emission responses of a CI engine fuelled with different metal-oxide based nanoparticles-diesel blends using different machine learning algorithms	ENERGY			English	Article						Machine learning; Prediction; Engine performance; Emission; Nanoparticle; Nanodiesel	GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; EXHAUST EMISSIONS; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; REGRESSION-MODELS; EXPANDED PERLITE; VEGETABLE-OIL; BIODIESEL; COMBUSTION	Deep learning (DL), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Kernel Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been applied to numerous fields owing to their high-accuracy and ability to analyze the non-linear problems. In this study, these machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are used to predict emission and performance characteristics of a CI engine fuelled with various metal-oxide based nano particles (Al2O3, CuO, and TiO2) at a mass fractions of 200 ppm. Assessed parameters in the study are carbon dioxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE). To evaluate the success of algorithms, four metrics (R-2, RMSE, rRMSE, and MBE) are discussed in detail. Tests performed at varying engine speeds from 1500 rpm to 3400 rpm with the intervals of 100 rpm. The addition of nanoparticles simultaneously reduced CO and NOx emissions because they ensured more complete combustion thanks to their inherent oxygen, the higher surface to volume ratio, superior thermal conductivities and their catalytic activity role. Further, the nano-sized particles ensured an accelerated heat transfer from the combustion chamber. In comparison with that of neat diesel fuel, the reduction in NOx is found to be 3.28, 7.53, and 10.05%, and the reduction in CO is found to be 8.3, 11.6, and 15.5% for TiO2, Al2O3, and CuO test fuels, respectively. Moreover, the presence of nanoparticles in test fuels has improved engine performance. As compared with those of neat diesel fuel, the doping of nanoparticles drops the BSFC value by 5.54, 7.89, and 9.96% for TiO2, CuO, and Al2O3, respectively, and enhanced BTE value to be 6.15, 8.87, and 11.23% for TiO2, CuO, and Al2O3, respectively. On the other hand, it can be said that all algorithms presented very satisfying results in the prediction of CI engine responses. All R-2 has changed between 0.901 and 0.994, and DL has given the highest R-2 value for each engine response. In terms of rRMSE, all results (except for one result in k-NN) are categorized as "excellent" according to the classification in the literature. Considering all metrics together, DL is giving the best results in the prediction of engine responses for the dataset used in this paper. Then it is closely followed by ANN, SVM, and k-NN algorithms, respectively. In conclusion, this paper is proving that the nanoparticle addition for ICEs is significantly dropping the exhaust pollutants, and improving the engine performance, and further the results can be successfully predicted with the machine learning algorithms.

The individual models included artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, flexible discriminant analysis, generalized linear model, generalized additive model, boosted regression trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and maximum entropy, and the ensemble models were Ensemble Model committee averaging (EMca), Ensemble Model confidence interval Inferior (EMcilnf), Ensemble Model confidence interval Superior (EMciSup), Ensemble Model to estimate the coefficient of variation (EMcv), Ensemble Model to estimate the mean (EMmean), Ensemble Model to estimate the median (EMmedian), and Ensemble Model based on weighted mean (EMwmean). The data set covered 201 flood events in the Haraz watershed (Mazandaran province in Iran) and 10,000 randomly selected non-occurrence points. Among the individual models, the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), which showed the highest value, belonged to boosted regression trees (0.975) and the lowest value was recorded for generalized linear model (0.642). On the other hand, the proposed EMmedian resulted in the highest accuracy (0.976) among all models. In spite of the outstanding performance of some models, nevertheless, variability among the prediction of individual models was considerable. Therefore, to reduce uncertainty, creating more generalizable, more stable, and less sensitive models, ensemble forecasting approaches and in particular the EMmedian is recommended for flood susceptibility assessment.

Integration of machine learning with clinical decision support tools, such as computerized alerts or diagnostic support, may offer physicians and others who provide health care targeted and timely information that can improve clinical decisions. Machine learning algorithms, however, may also be subject to biases. The biases include those related to missing data and patients not identified by algorithms, sample size and underestimation, and misclassification and measurement error. There is concern that biases and deficiencies in the data used by machine learning algorithms may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in health care. This Special Communication outlines the potential biases that may be introduced into machine learning-based clinical decision support tools that use electronic health record data and proposes potential solutions to the problems of overreliance on automation, algorithms based on biased data, and algorithms that do not provide information that is clinically meaningful. Existing health care disparities should not be amplified by thoughtless or excessive reliance on machines.

The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge	RADIOLOGY			English	Article								Purpose: The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge was created to show an application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, promote collaboration to catalyze AI model creation, and identify innovators in medical imaging. Materials and Methods: The goal of this challenge was to solicit individuals and teams to create an algorithm or model using ML techniques that would accurately determine skeletal age in a curated data set of pediatric hand radiographs. The primary evaluation measure was the mean absolute distance (MAD) in months, which was calculated as the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the model estimates and those of the reference standard, bone age. Results: A data set consisting of 14 236 hand radiographs (12 611 training set, 1425 validation set, 200 test set) was made available to registered challenge participants. A total of 260 individuals or teams registered on the Challenge website. A total of 105 submissions were uploaded from 48 unique users during the training, validation, and test phases. Almost all methods used deep neural network techniques based on one or more convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best five results based on MAD were 4.2, 4.4, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.5 months, respectively. Conclusion: The RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Machine Learning Challenge showed how a coordinated approach to solving a medical imaging problem can be successfully conducted. Future ML challenges will catalyze collaboration and development of ML tools and methods that can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

This information can be retrieved from network traffic traces, network alarms, signal quality indicators, users' behavioral data, etc. Advanced mathematical tools are required to extract meaningful information from these data and take decisions pertaining to the proper functioning of the networks from the network-generated data. Among these mathematical toots, machine learning (ML) is regarded as one of the most promising methodological approaches to perform network-data analysis and enable automated network self-configuration and fault management. The adoption of ML techniques in the field of optical communication networks is motivated by the unprecedented growth of network complexity faced by optical networks in the last few years. Such complexity increase is due to the introduction of a huge number of adjustable and interdependent system parameters (e.g., routing configurations, modulation format, symbol rate, coding schemes, etc.) that are enabled by the usage of coherent transmission/reception technologies, advanced digital signal processing, and compensation of nonlinear effects in optical fiber propagation. In this paper we provide an overview of the application of ML to optical communications and networking. We classify and survey relevant literature dealing with the topic, and we also provide an introductory tutorial on ML for researchers and practitioners interested in this field. Although a good number of research papers have recently appeared, the application of ML to optical networks is still in its infancy: to stimulate further work in this area, we conclude this paper proposing new possible research directions.

During the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the advancement and application of various types of ML models for energy systems. This paper presents the state of the art of ML models used in energy systems along with a novel taxonomy of models and applications. Through a novel methodology, ML models are identified and further classified according to the ML modeling technique, energy type, and application area. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the literature leads to an assessment and performance evaluation of the ML models and their applications, and a discussion of the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research. This paper further concludes that there is an outstanding rise in the accuracy, robustness, precision and generalization ability of the ML models in energy systems using hybrid ML models. Hybridization is reported to be effective in the advancement of prediction models, particularly for renewable energy systems, e.g., solar energy, wind energy, and biofuels. Moreover, the energy demand prediction using hybrid models of ML have highly contributed to the energy efficiency and therefore energy governance and sustainability.

Classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations offer the possibility to study larger systems at elevated temperatures, but they require accurate interatomic potentials. Herein the authors propose the concept of first-principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties, where ab initio level of accuracy is hierarchically bridged to explore the mechanical/failure response of macroscopic systems. It is demonstrated that machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) fitted to ab initio datasets play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To practically illustrate this novel possibility, the mechanical/failure response of graphene/borophene coplanar heterostructures is examined. It is shown that MLIPs conveniently outperform popular CMD models for graphene and borophene and they can evaluate the mechanical properties of pristine and heterostructure phases at room temperature. Based on the information provided by the MLIP-based CMD, continuum models of heterostructures using the finite element method can be constructed. The study highlights that MLIPs were the missing block for conducting first-principles multiscale modeling, and their employment empowers a straightforward route to bridge ab initio level accuracy and flexibility to explore the mechanical/failure response of nanostructures at continuum scale.

AI technology provides technical support for the management and operation of DWT processes, which is more efficient than relying solely on human operations. AI-based data analysis and evolutionary learning mechanisms are capable of realizing water quality diagnosis, autonomous decision making and operation process optimization and have the potential to establish a universal process analysis and predictive model platform. This review briefly introduces AI technologies that are widely used in DWT. Moreover, this paper reviews in detail the mature applications and latest discoveries of AI and machine learning technologies in the fields of source water quality, coagulation/flocculation, disinfection and membrane filtration, including source water contaminant monitoring and identification, accurate and efficient prediction of coagulation dosage, analysis of the formation of disinfection by-products and advanced control of membrane fouling. Finally, the challenges facing AI technologies and the issues that need further study are discussed; these challenges can be briefly summarized as a) obtaining more effective characterization data to screen and identify targeted contaminants in the complex background with the assistance of AI technologies and b) establishing a macro intelligence model and decision scheme for entire drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) to support the management of the water supply system.

The new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak is spreading rapidly worldwide. We collect arterial blood samples from 51 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Blood gas analysis is performed using a Siemens RAPID Point 500 blood gas analyzer. To accurately determine the factors that play a decisive role in the early recognition and discrimination of COVID-19 severity, a prediction framework that is based on an improved binary Harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm in combination with a kernel extreme learning machine is proposed in this paper. This method uses specular reflection learning to improve the original HHO algorithm and is referred to as HHOSRL. The experimental results show that the selected indicators, such as age, partial pressure of oxygen, oxygen saturation, sodium ion concentration, and lactic acid, are essential for the early accurate assessment of COVID-19 severity by the proposed feature selection method. The simulation results show that the established methodlogy can achieve promising performance. We believe that our proposed model provides an effective strategy for accurate early assessment of COVID-19 and distinguishing disease severity.

The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges. In this chapter, we will discuss some of these issues and efforts needed to develop robust deep-learning-based CAD tools and integrate these tools into the clinical workflow, thereby advancing towards the goal of providing reliable intelligent aids for patient care.

J	Zhang, PF; Shen, HT; Zhai, H				Zhang, Pengfei; Shen, Huitao; Zhai, Hui			Machine Learning Topological Invariants with Neural Networks	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								In this Letter we supervisedly train neural networks to distinguish different topological phases in the context of topological band insulators. After training with Hamiltonians of one-dimensional insulators with chiral symmetry, the neural network can predict their topological winding numbers with nearly 100% accuracy, even for Hamiltonians with larger winding numbers that are not included in the training data. These results show a remarkable success that the neural network can capture the global and nonlinear topological features of quantum phases from local inputs. By opening up the neural network, we confirm that the network does learn the discrete version of the winding number formula. We also make a couple of remarks regarding the role of the symmetry and the opposite effect of regularization techniques when applying machine learning to physical systems.

This study introduces a new ensemble machine learning model called Extra Tree Regression (ETR) for predicting monthly WQI values at the Lam Tsuen River in Hong Kong. The ETR model performance is compared with that of the classic standalone models, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Decision Tree Regression (DTR). The monthly input water quality data including Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3 -N), Nitrite-Nitrogen (NO2 -N), Phosphate (PO43-), potential for Hydrogen (pH), Temperature (T) and Turbidity (TUR) are used for building the prediction models. Various input data combinations are investigated and assessed in terms of prediction performance, using numerical indices and graphical comparisons. The analysis shows that the ETR model generally produces more accurate WQI predictions for both training and testing phases. Although including all the ten input variables achieves the highest prediction performance (R-test(2) = 0.98, RMSEtest = 2.99), a combination of input parameters including only BOD, Turbidity and Phosphate concentration provides the second highest prediction accuracy (R-test(2) = 0.97, RMSEtest = 3.74). The uncertainty analysis relative to model structure and input parameters highlights a higher sensitivity of the prediction results to the former. In general, the ETR model represents an improvement on previous approaches for WQI prediction, in terms of prediction performance and reduction in the number of input parameters.

We depart from the classical setting by allowing for (0) to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate (0), we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating (0) cause a heavy bias in estimators of (0) that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of (0) into estimating equations for (0). This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N-1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest (0) can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate (0); (2) making use of cross-fitting, which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N-1/2-neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.

Different types of nanomaterials and their chemical composition or "corona" have been widely studied in context with nanotoxicology. However, rare reports are available, which delineate the details of the cell shape index (CSI) and nuclear area factors (NAFs) as a descriptor of the type of nanomaterials. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-based graph modeling and correlation-establishing approach using tight junction protein ZO-1-mediated alteration in the cell/nuclei phenotype to quantify and propose it as indices of cell -NP interactions. We believe that the phenotypic variation (CSI and NAF) in the epithelial cell is governed by the physicochemical descriptors (e.g., shape, size, zeta potential, concentration, diffusion coefficients, polydispersity, and so on) of the different classes of nanomaterials, which critically determines the intracellular uptake or cell membrane interactions when exposed to the epithelial cells at sub-lethal concentrations. The intrinsic and extrinsic physicochemical properties of the representative nanomaterials (NMs) were measured using optical (dynamic light scattering, NP tracking analysis) methods to create a set of nanodescriptors contributing to cell-NM interactions via phenotype adjustments. We used correlation function as a machine-learning algorithm to successfully predict cell and nuclei shapes and polarity functions as phenotypic markers for five different classes of nanomaterials studied herein this report. The CSI and NAF as nanodescriptors can be used as intuitive cell phenotypic parameters to define the safety of nanomaterials extensively used in consumer products and nanomedicine.

Their main drawback has long been the long distance between users and servers, but this has been remedied by Edge Cloud Computing, where the cloud servers are located in the network edge. Edge Cloud Computing is regarded as essential for future networks and consequently, there is plenty of research on how to optimize its operation. However, the vast majority of them ignore the decision of where the edge servers should be deployed, despite how severely this can affect the performance of the system. Furthermore, future networks must also deal with massive amounts of clients and servers, such as the ones characteristic of the Internet of Things and 6G Networks. This demands solutions that are scalable. Given these two points, we propose a Machine Learning-based server deployment policy in 6G Internet of Things environments. Our solution is proven to approach optimality while being feasible. Furthermore, we also prove that our proposal leads to lower latency and higher resource efficiency than conventional Edge Cloud Computing server deployment solutions.

However, there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations. Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer. Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system, and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module, (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components. Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative example to validate the feasibility of the approach. The results show that the constantly updated data obtained from the information layer together with the machine learning algorithms in the application layer can efficiently predict the future condition of MEP components for maintenance planning.

This collection of statistical methods has already proved to be capable of considerably speeding up both fundamental and applied research. At present, we are witnessing an explosion of works that develop and apply machine learning to solid-state systems. We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure-property relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science. Finally, we propose solutions and future research paths for various challenges in computational materials science.	[Schmidt, Jonathan; Marques, Mario R. G.; Marques, Miguel A.

The increasing demand of these composites calls for an extensive investigation of their physical, chemical and mechanical behavior under different exposure conditions. Machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a powerful predictive tool for data-driven multi-physical modeling, leading to unprecedented insights and exploration of the system properties beyond the capability of traditional computational and experimental analyses. Here we aim to abridge the findings of the large volume of relevant literature and highlight the broad spectrum potential of ML in applications like prediction, optimization, feature identification, uncertainty quantification, reliability and sensitivity analysis along with the framework of different ML algorithms concerning polymer composites. Challenges like the curse of dimensionality, overfitting, noise and mixed variable problems are discussed, including the latest advancements in ML that have the potential to be integrated in the field of polymer composites. Based on the extensive literature survey, a few recommendations on the exploitation of various ML algorithms for addressing different critical problems concerning polymer composites are provided along with insightful perspectives on the potential directions of future research.

A Survey on Deep Learning: Algorithms, Techniques, and Applications	ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS			English	Article						Deep learning; neural networks; machine learning; distributed processing; big data; survey	NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; PREDICTION; IMAGES	The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain. Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and ground breaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.

This works examines the possibility of in-situ detection of keyholing porosity and balling instabilities. Specifically, a visible-light high speed camera with a fixed field of view is used to study the morphology of L-PBF melt pools in the Inconel 718 material system. A scale-invariant description of melt pool morphology is constructed using Computer Vision techniques and unsupervised Machine Learning is used to differentiate between observed melt pools. By observing melt pools produced across process space, in-situ signatures are identified which may indicate flaws such as those observed ex-situ. This linkage of ex-situ and in-situ morphology enabled the use of supervised Machine Learning to classify melt pools observed (with the high speed camera) during fusion of non-bulk geometries such as overhangs.

A bottleneck to fight this pandemic relates to the lack of diagnostic infrastructure for early detection of positive cases, particularly in rural and impoverished areas of developing countries. In this context, less costly and fast machine learning (ML) diagnosis-based systems are helpful. However, most of the research has focused on deep-learning techniques for diagnosis, which are computationally and technologically expensive. ML models have been mainly used as a benchmark and are not entirely explored in the existing literature on the topic of this paper. Objective: To analyze the capabilities of ML techniques (compared to deep learning) to diagnose COVID-19 cases based on X-ray images, assessing the performance of these techniques and using their predictive power for such a diagnosis. Methods: A factorial experiment was designed to establish this power with X-ray chest images of healthy, pneumonia, and COVID-19 infected patients. This design considers data-balancing methods, feature extraction approaches, different algorithms, and hyperparameter optimization. The ML techniques were evaluated based on classification metrics, including accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: The design of experiment provided the mean and its confidence intervals for the predictive capability of different ML techniques, which reached AUROC values as high as 90% with suitable sensitivity and specificity. Among the learning algorithms, support vector machines and random forest performed best. The down-sampling method for unbalanced data improved the predictive power significantly for the images used in this study. Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrated that ML techniques are able to identify COVID-19 infected patients. The results provided suitable values of sensitivity and specificity, minimizing the false-positive or false-negative rates. The models were trained with significantly low computational resources, which helps to provide access and deployment in rural and impoverished areas.

We survey the recent advances and transformative potential of machine learning (ML), including deep learning, in the field of acoustics. ML is a broad family of techniques, which are often based in statistics, for automatically detecting and utilizing patterns in data. Relative to conventional acoustics and signal processing, ML is data-driven. Given sufficient training data, ML can discover complex relationships between features and desired labels or actions, or between features themselves. With large volumes of training data, ML can discover models describing complex acoustic phenomena such as human speech and reverberation. ML in acoustics is rapidly developing with compelling results and significant future promise. We first introduce ML, then highlight ML developments in four acoustics research areas: source localization in speech processing, source localization in ocean acoustics, bioacoustics, and environmental sounds in everyday scenes.

However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations.

This paper presents an approach to analyze social media posts to assess the footprint of and the damage caused by natural disasters through combining machine-learning techniques (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for semantic information extraction with spatial and temporal analysis (local spatial autocorrelation) for hot spot detection. Our results demonstrate that earthquake footprints can be reliably and accurately identified in our use case. More, a number of relevant semantic topics can be automatically identified without a priori knowledge, revealing clearly differing temporal and spatial signatures. Furthermore, we are able to generate a damage map that indicates where significant losses have occurred. The validation of our results using statistical measures, complemented by the official earthquake footprint by US Geological Survey and the results of the HAZUS loss model, shows that our approach produces valid and reliable outputs. Thus, our approach may improve current disaster management procedures through generating a new and unseen information layer in near real time.

The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.

J	Jinnouchi, R; Karsai, F; Kresse, G				Jinnouchi, Ryosuke; Karsai, Ferenc; Kresse, Georg			On-the-fly machine learning force field generation: Application to melting points	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							1ST-ORDER PHASE-TRANSITIONS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; POTENTIALS	An efficient and robust on-the-fly machine learning force field method is developed and integrated into an electronic-structure code. This method realizes automatic generation of machine learning force fields on the basis of Bayesian inference during molecular dynamics simulations, where the first-principles calculations are only executed, when new configurations out of already sampled datasets appear. The developed method is applied to the calculation of melting points of Al, Si, Ge, Sn and MgO. The applications indicate that more than 99% of the first-principles calculations are bypassed during the force field generation. This allows the machine to quickly construct first-principles datasets over wide phase spaces. Furthermore, with the help of the generated machine learning force fields, simulations are accelerated by a factor of thousand compared with first-principles calculations. Accuracies of the melting points calculated by the force fields are examined by thermodynamic perturbation theory, and the examination indicates that the machine learning force fields can quantitatively reproduce the first-principles melting points.

However, securing consistent occupant feedback for model development is challenging as the current methods of data collection rely on individuals' survey participation. We explored the use of a new type of feedback, occupants' heating and cooling behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS) for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The model development draws from field data including PCS control behavior, environmental conditions and mechanical system settings collected from 38 occupants in an office building, and employs six machine learning algorithms. The results showed that (1) personal comfort models based on all field data produced the median accuracy of 0.73 among all subjects and improved predictive accuracy compared to conventional models (PMV, adaptive) which produced a median accuracy of 0.51; (2) the PMV and adaptive models produced individual comfort predictions only slightly better than random guessing under the relatively mild indoor environment observed in the field study; and (3) the models based on PCS control behavior produced the best prediction accuracy when individually assessing all categories of field data acquired in the study. We conclude that personal comfort models based on occupants' heating and cooling behavior can effectively predict individuals' thermal preference and can therefore be used in everyday comfort management to improve occupant satisfaction and energy use in buildings.

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target-domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.

Digital mapping of soil carbon fractions with machine learning	GEODERMA			English	Article						Digital soil mapping; Soil organic carbon fractions; Feature selection; Machine learning; Regression kriging; Residual spatial autocorrelation	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; ORGANIC-MATTER; SPATIAL PREDICTION; RANDOM FORESTS; REGIONAL-SCALE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGRESSION; STOCKS; STABILIZATION; IMPACTS	Our understanding of the spatial distribution of soil carbon (C) pools across diverse land uses, soils, and climatic gradients at regional scale is still limited. Research in digital soil mapping and modeling that investigates the interplay between (i) soil C pools and environmental factors ("deterministic trend model") and (ii) stochastic, spatially dependent variations in soil C fractions ("stochastic model") is just emerging. This evoked our motivation to investigate soil C pools in the State of Florida covering about 150,000 km(2). Our specific objectives were to (i) compare different soil C pool models that quantify stochastic and/or deterministic components, (ii) assess the prediction performance of soil C models, and (iii) identify environmental factors that impart most control on labile and recalcitrant pools and soil total C (TC). We used soil data (0-20 cm) from a research collected at 1014 georeferenced sites including measured bulk density, recalcitrant carbon (RC), labile (hot-water extractable) carbon (HC) and TC. A comprehensive set of 327 geospatial soil-environmental variables was acquired. The Boruta method was employed to identify "all-relevant" soil-environmental predictors. We employed eight methods - Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), Bagged Regression Tree (BaRT), Boosted Regression Tree (BoRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Regression Kriging (RK), and Ordinary Kriging (OK) - to predict soil C fractions and TC. Overall, 36, 20 and 25 predictors stood out as "all-relevant" to estimate TC, RC and HC, respectively. We predicted a mean of 5.29 +/- 3.58 kg TC m(-2) in the top 20 cm with the best model. The prediction performance assessed by the Ratio of Prediction Error to Inter-quartile Range for TC stocks was as follows: RF > SVM > BoRT > BaRT > PLSR > RK > CART > OK. The best models explained 71.6%, 71.7% and 30.5% of the total variation for TC, RC and HC, respectively. Biotic and hydro-pedological factors explained most of the variation in soil C pools and TC; lithologic and climatic factors showed some relationships to soil C pools and TC, whereas topographic factors faded from soil C models.

Owing to the chemical versatility of organic building blocks, a large number of organic semi-conductors have been used for organic solar cells. Selecting a suitable organic semi-conductor is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Data-driven science, the fourth paradigm of science, has the potential to guide experimentalists to discover and develop new high-performance materials. The last decade has seen impressive progress in materials informatics and data science; however, data-driven molecular design of organic solar cell materials is still challenging. The data-analysis capability of machine learning methods is well known. This review is written about the use of machine learning methods for organic solar cell research. In this review, we have outlined the basics of machine learning and common procedures for applying machine learning. A brief introduction on different classes of machine learning algorithms as well as related software and tools is provided. Then, the current research status of machine learning in organic solar cells is reviewed. We have discussed the challenges in anticipating the data driven material design, such as the complexity metric of organic solar cells, diversity of chemical structures and necessary programming ability. We have also proposed some suggestions that can enhance the usefulness of machine learning for organic solar cell research enterprises.

Identifying topological order through unsupervised machine learning	NATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS	The Landau description of phase transitions relies on the identification of a local order parameter that indicates the onset of a symmetry-breaking phase. In contrast, topological phase transitions evade this paradigm and, as a result, are harder to identify. Recently, machine learning techniques have been shown to be capable of characterizing topological order in the presence of human supervision. Here, we propose an unsupervised approach based on diffusion maps that learns topological phase transitions from raw data without the need for manual feature engineering. Using bare spin configurations as input, the approach is shown to be capable of classifying samples of the two-dimensional XY model by winding number and capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. We also demonstrate the success of the approach on the Ising gauge theory, another paradigmatic model with topological order. In addition, a connection between the output of diffusion maps and the eigenstates of a quantum-well Hamiltonian is derived. Topological classification via diffusion maps can therefore enable fully unsupervised studies of exotic phases of matter.

This parameter is generally determined by conducting several tests at different ages of concrete in spite of the fact that such tests are not only costly but also time-consuming. As an alternative to these tests, machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to estimate experimental results. However, the dependence of compressive strength on different parameters in the fabrication of concrete makes the prediction problem challenging, especially in the case of concrete with partial replacements for cement. In this investigation, an extreme learning machine (ELM) is combined with a metaheuristic algorithm known as grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and a novel hybrid ELM-GWO model is proposed to predict the compressive strength of concrete with partial replacements for cement. To evaluate the performance of the ELM-GWO model, five of the most well-known ML models including an artificial neural network (ANN), an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), an extreme learning machine, a support vector regression with radial basis function (RBF) kernel (SVR-RBF), and another SVR with a polynomial function (Poly) kernel (SVR-Poly) are developed. Finally, the performance of the models is compared with each other. The results of the paper show that combining the ELM model with GWO can efficiently improve the performance of this model. Also, it is deducted that the ELM-GWO model is capable of reaching superior performance indices in comparison with those of the other models.

First, we use machine learning to remove the confounding effects of weather conditions on pollution concentrations. Second, we use a new augmented synthetic control method (Ben-Michael et al. in The augmented synthetic control method. University of California Berkeley, Mimeo, 2019. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04170.pdf) to estimate the impact of the lockdown on weather normalised pollution relative to a control group of cities that were not in lockdown. We find NO2 concentrations fell by as much as 24 mu g/m(3) during the lockdown (a reduction of 63% from the pre-lockdown level), while PM10 concentrations fell by a similar amount but for a shorter period. The lockdown had no discernible impact on concentrations of SO2 or CO.

A Review on a Deep Learning Perspective in Brain Cancer Classification	CANCERS			English	Review						cancer; brain; pathophysiology; imaging; machine learning; extreme learning; deep learning; neurological disorders	TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; TUMORS; MACHINE; RISK; MRI; PROLIFERATION; SEGMENTATION; PROGNOSIS; DISEASE	A World Health Organization (WHO) Feb 2018 report has recently shown that mortality rate due to brain or central nervous system (CNS) cancer is the highest in the Asian continent. It is of critical importance that cancer be detected earlier so that many of these lives can be saved. Cancer grading is an important aspect for targeted therapy. As cancer diagnosis is highly invasive, time consuming and expensive, there is an immediate requirement to develop a non-invasive, cost-effective and efficient tools for brain cancer characterization and grade estimation. Brain scans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), as well as other imaging modalities, are fast and safer methods for tumor detection. In this paper, we tried to summarize the pathophysiology of brain cancer, imaging modalities of brain cancer and automatic computer assisted methods for brain cancer characterization in a machine and deep learning paradigm. Another objective of this paper is to find the current issues in existing engineering methods and also project a future paradigm. Further, we have highlighted the relationship between brain cancer and other brain disorders like stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Wilson's disease, leukoriaosis, and other neurological disorders in the context of machine learning and the deep learning paradigm.

However, conventional part evaluation and qualification techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), can only be utilized after the build is complete, and thus eliminate any potential to correct defects during the build process. In contrast to post-build CT, in situ defect detection based on in situ sensing, such as layerwise visual inspection, enables the potential for in-process re-melting and correction of detected defects and thus facilitates in-process part qualification. This paper describes the development and implementation of such an in situ defect detection strategy for powder bed fusion (PBF) AM using supervised machine learning. During the build process, multiple images were collected at each build layer using a high resolution digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. For each neighborhood in the resulting layerwise image stack, multi-dimensional visual features were extracted and evaluated using binary classification techniques, i.e. a linear support vector machine (SVM). Through binary classification, neighborhoods are then categorized as either a flaw, i.e. an undesirable interruption in the typical structure of the material, or a nominal build condition. Ground truth labels, i.e. the true location of flaws and nominal build areas, which are needed to train the binary classifiers, were obtained from post-build high-resolution 3D CT scan data. In CT scans, discontinuities, e.g. incomplete fusion, porosity, cracks, or inclusions, were identified using automated analysis tools or manual inspection. The xyz locations of the CT data were transferred into the layerwise image domain using an affine transformation, which was estimated using reference points embedded in the part. After the classifier had been properly trained, in situ defect detection accuracies greater than 80% were demonstrated during cross-validation experiments.

In analytical sciences, machine learning provides an unprecedented opportunity to extract information from complex or big datasets in chromatography, mass spectrometry, NMR, and spectroscopy, among others. This is especially the case in Raman and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) techniques where vibrational spectra of complex chemical mixtures are acquired as large datasets for the analysis or imaging of chemical systems. The classical linear methods of processing the information no longer suffice and thus machine learning methods for extracting the chemical information from Raman and SERS experiments have been implemented recently. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of the most common machine learning techniques employed in Raman, a guideline for new users to implement machine learning in their data analysis process, and an overview of modern applications of machine learning in Raman and SERS.

Disrupting 3D printing of medicines with machine learning	TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; DRUG-DELIVERY; IN-VITRO; RELEASE; PREDICTION; QUALITY; DESIGN; PHARMACEUTICALS; FABRICATION	3D printing (3DP) is a progressive technology capable of transforming pharmaceutical development. However, despite its promising advantages, its transition into clinical settings remains slow. To make the vital leap to mainstream clinical practice and improve patient care, 3DP must harness modern technologies. Machine learning (ML), an influential branch of artificial intelligence, may be a key partner for 3DP. Together, 3DP and ML can utilise intelligence based on human learning to accelerate drug product development, ensure stringent quality control (QC), and inspire innovative dosage-form design. With ML's capabilities, streamlined 3DP drug delivery could mark the next era of personalised medicine. This review details how ML can be applied to elevate the 3DP of pharmaceuticals and importantly, how it can expedite 3DP's integration into mainstream healthcare.

Data-driven approaches, such as ML, are becoming more popular for estimating the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) due to greater availability of battery data and improved computing power capabilities. This paper provides a survey of battery state estimation methods based on ML approaches such as feedforward neural networks (FNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), support vector machines (SVM), radial basis functions (RBF), and Hamming networks. Comparisons between methods are shown in terms of data quality, inputs and outputs, test conditions, battery types, and stated accuracy to give readers a bigger picture view of the ML landscape for SOC and SOH estimation. Additionally, to provide insight into how to best approach with the comparison of different neural network structures, an FNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN are trained fifty times each for 3000 epochs. The error is somewhat different for each training repetition due to the random initial values of the trainable parameters, demonstrating that it is important to train networks multiple times to achieve the best result. Furthermore, it is recommended that when performing a comparison among estimation techniques such as those presented in this review paper, the compared networks should have a similar number of learnable parameters and be trained and tested with identical data. Otherwise, it is difficult to make a general conclusion regarding the quality of a given estimation technique.

Efforts are already under way for the discovery of anti-angiogenic peptides (AAPs) as a promising therapeutic route, which tackle the formation of new blood vessels. As such, the identification of AAPs constitutes a viable path for understanding their mechanistic properties pertinent for the discovery of new anti-cancer drugs. In spite of the abundance of peptide sequences in public databases, experimental efforts in the identification of anti-angiogenic peptides have progressed very slowly owing to high expenditures and laborious nature. Owing to its inherent ability to make sense of large volumes of data, machine learning (ML) represents a lucrative technique that can be harnessed for peptide-based drug discovery. In this review, we conducted a comprehensive and comparative analysis of ML-based AAP predictors in terms of their employed feature descriptors, ML algorithms, cross-validation methods and prediction performance. Moreover, the common framework of these AAP predictors and their inherent weaknesses are also discussed. Particularly, we explore future perspectives for improving the prediction accuracy and model interpretability, which represent an interesting avenue for overcoming some of the inherent weaknesses of existing AAP predictors. We anticipate that this review would assist researchers in the rapid screening and identification of promising AAPs for clinical use.

In this study, a novel thermal model is developed to capture the temperature behavior of batteries under ESC conditions. Experiments were systematically performed under different battery initial state of charge and ambient temperatures. Based on the experimental results, we employed an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based thermal (ELMT) model to depict battery temperature behavior under ESC, where a lumped-state thermal model was used to replace the activation function of conventional ELMs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compared the ELMT model with a multi-lumped-state thermal (MLT) model parameterized by the genetic algorithm using the experimental data from various sets of battery cells. It is shown that the ELMT model can achieve higher computational efficiency than the MLT model and better fitting and prediction accuracy, where the average root mean squared error (RMSE) of the fitting is 0.65 degrees C for the ELMT model and 3.95 degrees C for the MLT model, and the RMES of the prediction under new data set is 3.97 degrees C for the ELMT model and 6.11 degrees C for the MLT model.

J	Zhu, LY; Zhang, WW; Kou, JQ; Liu, YL				Zhu, Linyang; Zhang, Weiwei; Kou, Jiaqing; Liu, Yilang			Machine learning methods for turbulence modeling in subsonic flows around airfoils	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS			English	Article							QUANTIFYING WALL TURBULENCE; BASIS FUNCTION NETWORK; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SEPARATED FLOWS; VELOCITY; FIELD	In recent years, the data-driven turbulence model has attracted widespread concern in fluid mechanics. The existing approaches modify or supplement the original turbulence model by machine learning based on the experimental/numerical data, in order to augment the capability of the present turbulence models. Different from the previous researches, this paper directly reconstructs a mapping function between the turbulent eddy viscosity and the mean flow variables by neural networks and completely replaces the original partial differential equation model. On the other hand, compared with the machine learning models for the low Reynolds (Re) number flows based on direct numerical simulation data, high Reynolds number flows around airfoils present the apparent scaling effects and strong anisotropy, which induce large challenges in accuracy and generalization capability for the machine learning algorithm. We mainly concentrate on the high Reynolds number turbulent flows around the airfoils and take the results calculated by the computational fluid dynamics solver with the Spallart-Allmaras (SA) model as training data to construct a high-dimensional data-driven network model based on machine learning. The radial basis function neural network and the auxiliary optimization methods are adopted, and the individual models are built separately for the flow fields of the near-wall region, wake region, and far-field region. The training data in this paper is extracted from only three subsonic flow fields of NACA0012 airfoil. The data-driven turbulence model can be applied to various airfoils and flow states, and the predicted eddy viscosity, lift/drag coefficients, and skin friction distributions are all in good agreement with the results of the original SA model. This research demonstrates the promising prospect of machine learning methods in future studies about turbulence modeling.

However, due to (1) the lack of large-scale studies, (2) the compound series bias that is characteristic of drug discovery datasets and (3) the hyperparameter selection bias that comes with the high number of potential deep learning architectures, it remains unclear whether deep learning can indeed outperform existing computational methods in drug discovery tasks. We therefore assessed the performance of several deep learning methods on a large-scale drug discovery dataset and compared the results with those of other machine learning and target prediction methods. To avoid potential biases from hyperparameter selection or compound series, we used a nested cluster-cross-validation strategy. We found (1) that deep learning methods significantly outperform all competing methods and (2) that the predictive performance of deep learning is in many cases comparable to that of tests performed in wet labs (i.e., in vitro assays).

Exploiting machine learning for end-to-end drug discovery and development	NATURE MATERIALS			English	Article							PHARMACEUTICAL-INDUSTRY; METABOLIC STABILITY; PREDICTION; MODELS; INFORMATION; GENERATION; MOLECULES; ATTRITION; DATABASE; SUPPORT	A variety of machine learning methods such as naive Bayesian, support vector machines and more recently deep neural networks are demonstrating their utility for drug discovery and development. These leverage the generally bigger datasets created from high-throughput screening data and allow prediction of bioactivities for targets and molecular properties with increased levels of accuracy. We have only just begun to exploit the potential of these techniques but they may already be fundamentally changing the research process for identifying new molecules and/or repurposing old drugs. The integrated application of such machine learning models for end-to-end (E2E) application is broadly relevant and has considerable implications for developing future therapies and their targeting.

While conventional machine learning (ML) methods, including artificial neural network, principal component analysis, support vector machines, etc., have been successfully applied to the detection and categorization of bearing faults for decades, recent developments in DL algorithms in the last five years have sparked renewed interest in both industry and academia for intelligent machine health monitoring. In this paper, we first provide a brief review of conventional ML methods, before taking a deep dive into the state-of-the-art DL algorithms for bearing fault applications. Specifically, the superiority of DL based methods are analyzed in terms of fault feature extraction and classification performances; many new functionalities enabled by DL techniques are also summarized. In addition, to obtain a more intuitive insight, a comparative study is conducted on the classification accuracy of different algorithms utilizing the open source Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset. Finally, to facilitate the transition on applying various DL algorithms to bearing fault diagnostics, detailed recommendations and suggestions are provided for specific application conditions. Future research directions to further enhance the performance of DL algorithms on health monitoring are also discussed.

Insights about the decision making are mostly opaque for humans. Particularly understanding the decision making in highly sensitive areas such as healthcare or finance, is of paramount importance. The decision-making behind the black boxes requires it to be more transparent, accountable, and understandable for humans.

We conduct a state-of-the-art survey that reviews past and recent explainable SML approaches and classifies them according to the introduced definitions.

Compared with traditional approaches, ML offers advantages to handle complex problems, provide computational efficiency, propagate and treat uncertainties, and facilitate decision making. Also, the maturing of ML has led to significant advances in not only the main-stream artificial intelligence (AI) research but also other science and engineering fields, such as material science, bioengineering, construction management, and transportation engineering. This study conducts a comprehensive review of the progress and challenges of implementing ML in the earthquake engineering domain. A hierarchical attribute matrix is adopted to categorize the existing literature based on four traits identified in the field, such as ML method, topic area, data resource, and scale of analysis. The state-of-the-art review indicates to what extent ML has been applied in four topic areas of earthquake engineering, including seismic hazard analysis, system identification and damage detection, seismic fragility assessment, and structural control for earthquake mitigation. Moreover, research challenges and the associated future research needs are discussed, which include embracing the next generation of data sharing and sensor technologies, implementing more advanced ML techniques, and developing physics-guided ML models.

Apart from developing new AI methods per se, there are many opportunities and challenges for the imaging community, including the development of a common nomenclature, better ways to share image data, and standards for validating AI program use across different imaging platforms and Patient populations. AI surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs can be used to extract "radiomic" information from images not discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will beneficially incorporate AI methods into their practices. Current limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote access solutions. Success for AI in imaging will be measured by value created: increased diagnostic certainty, faster turnaround, better outcomes for patients, and better quality of work life for radiologists. AI offers a new and promising set of methods for analyzing image data. Radiologists will explore these new pathways and are likely to play a leading role in medical applications of AI.

Here we introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical diffractive deep neural network ((DNN)-N-2) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning-based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. We created 3D-printed D(2)NNs that implement classification of images of handwritten digits and fashion products, as well as the function of an imaging lens at a terahertz spectrum. Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light, various complex functions that computer-based neural networks can execute; will find applications in all-optical image analysis, feature detection, and object classification; and will also enable new camera designs and optical components that perform distinctive tasks using D(2)NNs.

Predicting compressive strength of lightweight foamed concrete using extreme learning machine model	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE			English	Article						Foamed concrete; Compressive strength; Prediction; ELM; MARS; M5 Tree; SVR	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; EFFECTIVE DROUGHT INDEX; PAN EVAPORATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; RADIATION; RAINFALL; FIBER	In this research, a machine learning model namely extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to predict the compressive strength of foamed concrete. The potential of the ELM model is validated in comparison with multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 Tree models and support vector regression (SVR). The Lightweight foamed concrete is produced via creating a cellular structure in a cementitious matrix during the mixing process, and is widely used in heat insulation, sound attenuation, roofing, tunneling and geotechnical applications. Achieving product consistency and accurate predictability of its performance is key to the success of this technology. In the present study, an experimental database encompassing pertinent data retrieved from several previous studies has been created and utilized to train and validate the ELM, MARS, M5 Tree and SVR machine learning models. The input parameters for the predictive models include the cement content, oven dry density, water-to-binder ratio and foamed volume. The predictive accuracy of the four models has been assessed via several statistical score indicators. The results showed that the proposed ELM model achieved an adequate level of prediction accuracy, improving MARS, M5 Tree and SVR models. Hence, the ELM model could be employed as a reliable and accurate data intelligent approach for predicting the compressive strength of foamed concrete, saving laborious trial batches required to attain the desired product quality.

Predicting drug-microbiome interactions with machine learning	BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; Drug discovery and development; Microorganisms; Bacteria; Biopharmaceutics; Pharmacokinetics; Metabolism of pharmaceuticals and medicines; Repurposing; Information technology; Big data	COLONIC BACTERIAL METABOLISM; GUT MICROBIOME; INACTIVATION; INDIVIDUALS; DIVERSITY; STABILITY; IMPACT	Pivotal work in recent years has cast light on the importance of the human microbiome in maintenance of health and physiological response to drugs. It is now clear that gastrointestinal microbiota have the metabolic power to promote, inactivate, or even toxify the efficacy of a drug to a level of clinically relevant significance. At the same time, it appears that drug intake has the propensity to alter gut microbiome composition, potentially affecting health and response to other drugs. Since the precise composition of an individual's microbiome is unique, one's drug-microbiome relationship is similarly unique. Thus, in the age of evermore personalised medicine, the ability to predict individuals' drug-microbiome interactions is highly sought. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful toolkit capable of characterising and predicting drug-microbiota interactions at the individual patient level. ML techniques have the potential to learn the mechanisms operating drug-microbiome activities and measure patients' risk of such occurrences. This review will outline current knowledge at the drug-microbiota interface, and present ML as a technique for examining and forecasting personalised drug-microbiome interactions. When harnessed effectively, ML could alter how the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare professionals consider the drug-microbiome axis in patient care.

Deep diversification of an AAV capsid protein by machine learning	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							FITNESS LANDSCAPE; THERMODYNAMIC STABILITY; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS; IN-VITRO; EVOLUTION; GENE; THERAPY	Modern experimental technologies can assay large numbers of biological sequences, but engineered protein libraries rarely exceed the sequence diversity of natural protein families. Machine learning (ML) models trained directly on experimental data without biophysical modeling provide one route to accessing the full potential diversity of engineered proteins. Here we apply deep learning to design highly diverse adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) capsid protein variants that remain viable for packaging of a DNA payload. Focusing on a 28-amino acid segment, we generated 201,426 variants of the AAV2 wild-type (WT) sequence yielding 110,689 viable engineered capsids, 57,348 of which surpass the average diversity of natural AAV serotype sequences, with 12-29 mutations across this region. Even when trained on limited data, deep neural network models accurately predict capsid viability across diverse variants. This approach unlocks vast areas of functional but previously unreachable sequence space, with many potential applications for the generation of improved viral vectors and protein therapeutics. Viable AAV capsids are designed with a machine learning approach.

These have generated novel opportunities for development of dedicated data-intensive machine learning techniques. In particular, recent research in deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and their combination (deep RL) promise to revolutionize the future of artificial intelligence. The growth in computational power accompanied by faster and increased data storage, and declining computing costs have already allowed scientists in various fields to apply these techniques on data sets that were previously intractable owing to their size and complexity. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the application of DL, RL, and deep RL techniques in mining biological data. In addition, we compare the performances of DL techniques when applied to different data sets across various application domains. Finally, we outline open issues in this challenging research area and discuss future development perspectives.

Given the ubiquitous smart mobile gadgets and IoT devices, it is expected that a majority of intelligent applications will be deployed at the edge of wireless networks. This trend has generated strong interest in realizing an "intelligent edge" to support AI-enabled applications at various edge devices. Accordingly, a new research area, called edge learning, has emerged, which crosses and revolutionizes two disciplines: wireless communication and machine learning. A major theme in edge learning is to overcome the limited computing power, as well as limited data, at each edge device. This is accomplished by leveraging the mobile edge computing platform and exploiting the massive data distributed over a large number of edge devices. In such systems, learning from distributed data and communicating between the edge server and devices are two critical and coupled aspects, and their fusion poses many new research challenges. This article advocates a new set of design guidelines for wireless communication in edge learning, collectively called learning- driven communication. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these design guidelines. Unique research opportunities are identified.

Here, we present a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning IAPs (ML-IAPs) based on four local environment descriptors-atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSF), smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP), the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) bispectrum components, and moment tensors-using a diverse data set generated using high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The data set comprising bcc (Li, Mo) and fcc (Cu, Ni) metals and diamond group IV semiconductors (Si, Ge) is chosen to span a range of crystal structures and bonding. All descriptors studied show excellent performance in predicting energies and forces far surpassing that of classical IAPs, as well as predicting properties such as elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves. We observe a general trade-off between accuracy and the degrees of freedom of each model and, consequently, computational cost. We will discuss these trade-offs in the context of model selection for molecular dynamics and other applications.

There is some evidence that better weather forecasts can be produced by introducing big data mining and neural networks into the weather prediction workflow. Here, we discuss the question of whether it is possible to completely replace the current numerical weather models and data assimilation systems with DL approaches. This discussion entails a review of state-of-the-art machine learning concepts and their applicability to weather data with its pertinent statistical properties. We think that it is not inconceivable that numerical weather models may one day become obsolete, but a number of fundamental breakthroughs are needed before this goal comes into reach. This article is part of the theme issue 'Machine learning for weather and climate modelling'.	[Schultz, M. G.; Betancourt, C.; Gong, B.; Kleinert, F.; Langguth, M.; Leufen, L.

In the wake of disruptive IoT with a huge amount and variety of data, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) mechanisms will play a pivotal role to bring intelligence to the IoT networks. Among other aspects, ML and DL can play an essential role in addressing the challenges of resource management in large-scale IoT networks. In this article, we conduct a systematic and in-depth survey of the ML- and DL-based resource management mechanisms in cellular wireless and IoT networks. We start with the challenges of resource management in cellular IoT and low-power IoT networks, review the traditional resource management mechanisms for IoT networks, and motivate the use of ML and DL techniques for resource management in these networks. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing ML- and DL-based resource management techniques in wireless IoT networks and the techniques specifically designed for HetNets, MIMO and D2D communications, and NOMA networks. To this end, we also identify the future research directions in using ML and DL for resource allocation and management in IoT networks.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						industrial hemp; classification; hyperspectral imaging; image processing; machine learning	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; CHEMOMETRICS; SEEDLINGS	As an emerging cash crop, industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) grown for cannabidiol (CBD) has spurred a surge of interest in the United States. Cultivar selection and harvest timing are important to produce CBD hemp profitably and avoid economic loss resulting from the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration in the crop exceeding regulatory limits. Hence there is a need for differentiating CBD hemp cultivars and growth stages to aid in cultivar and genotype selection and optimization of harvest timing. Current methods that rely on visual assessment of plant phenotypes and chemical procedures are limited because of its subjective and destructive nature. In this study, hyperspectral imaging was proposed as a novel, objective, and non-destructive method for differentiating hemp cultivars, growth stages as well as plant organs (leaves and flowers). Five cultivars of CBD hemp were grown greenhouse conditions and leaves and flowers were sampled at five growth stages 2-10 weeks in 2-week intervals after flower initiation and scanned by a benchtop hyperspectral imaging system in the spectral range of 400-1000 nm. The acquired images were subjected to image processing procedures to extract the spectra of hemp samples. The spectral profiles and scatter plots of principal component analysis of the spectral data revealed a certain degree of separation between hemp cultivars, growth stages, and plant organs. Machine learning based on regularized linear discriminant analysis achieved the accuracy of up to 99.6% in differentiating the five hemp cultivars. Plant organ and growth stage need to be factored into model development for hemp cultivar classification. The classification models achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating the five growth stages and two plant organs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of hyperspectral imaging for differentiating cultivars, growth stages and plant organs of CBD hemp, which is a potentially useful tool for growers and breeders of CBD hemp.

J	Feng, PY; Wang, B; Liu, DL; Yu, Q				Feng, Puyu; Wang, Bin; Liu, De Li; Yu, Qiang			Machine learning-based integration of remotely-sensed drought factors can improve the estimation of agricultural drought in South-Eastern Australia	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agricultural drought; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index; Remote sensing; Machine learning	MONITORING METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS; RANDOM FORESTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INDEX; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; CLASSIFICATION; TEMPERATURE	Agricultural drought is a natural hazard arising from insufficient crop water supply. Many drought indices have been developed to characterize agricultural drought, relying on either ground-based climate data or various remotely-sensed drought proxies. Ground-based drought indices are more accurate but limited in coverage, while remote sensing drought indices cover large areas but have poor precision. Application of advanced data fusion approaches based on remotely-sensed data to estimate ground-based drought indices may help fill this gap. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether various remotely-sensed drought factors could be effectively used for monitoring agricultural drought in south-eastern Australia. In this study, thirty remotely-sensed drought factors from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors were used to reproduce a ground-based drought index, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) during 2001-2017 for the New South Wales wheat belt in south-eastern Australia. Three advanced machine learning methods, i.e. bias-corrected random forest, support vector machine, and multi-layer perceptron neural network, were adopted as the regression models in this procedure. A station-based historical climate dataset and observed wheat yields were used as reference data to evaluate the performance of the model-predicted SPEI in reflecting agricultural drought. Results show that the bias-corrected random forest model outperformed the other two models for SPEI prediction, as quantified by the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R-2 values (< 0.28 and similar to 0.9, respectively). Drought distribution maps produced by the bias-corrected random forest model were then compared with the station-based drought maps, showing strong visual and statistical agreement. Furthermore, the model-predicted SPEI values were more highly correlated with observed wheat yields than the station-based SPEI. The method used in this study is effective and fast, and based on data that are readily available. It can be easily extended to other cropping areas to produce a rapid overview of drought conditions and to enhance the present capabilities of real-time drought monitoring.

Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics.

However, to date, most nanophotonic devices have been designed based on fixed-shape optical elements, and a large portion of their design potential has remained unexplored. It is only recently that free-form design schemes have been spotlighted in nanophotonics, offering routes to make a break from conventional design constraints and utilize the full design potential. In this review, we systematically overview the nascent yet rapidly growing field of free-form nanophotonic device design. We attempt to define the term "free-form" in the context of photonic device design, and survey different strategies for free-form optimization of nanophotonic devices spanning from classical methods, adjoint-based methods, to contemporary machine-learning-based approaches.

Use of Machine Learning Models to Predict Death After Acute Myocardial Infarction	JAMA CARDIOLOGY			English	Article							IN-HOSPITAL MORTALITY; ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME; RISK PREDICTION; REGISTRY	Importance Accurate prediction of adverse outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can guide the triage of care services and shared decision-making, and novel methods hold promise for using existing data to generate additional insights. Objective To evaluate whether contemporary machine learning methods can facilitate risk prediction by including a larger number of variables and identifying complex relationships between predictors and outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used the American College of Cardiology Chest Pain-MI Registry to identify all AMI hospitalizations between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2018, to October 22, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Three machine learning models were developed and validated to predict in-hospital mortality based on patient comorbidities, medical history, presentation characteristics, and initial laboratory values. Models were developed based on extreme gradient descent boosting (XGBoost, an interpretable model), a neural network, and a meta-classifier model. Their accuracy was compared against the current standard developed using a logistic regression model in a validation sample. Results A total of 755 402 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [13] years; 495 202 [65.5%] male) were identified during the study period. In independent validation, 2 machine learning models, gradient descent boosting and meta-classifier (combination including inputs from gradient descent boosting and a neural network), marginally improved discrimination compared with logistic regression (C statistic, 0.90 for best performing machine learning model vs 0.89 for logistic regression). Nearly perfect calibration in independent validation data was found in the XGBoost (slope of predicted to observed events, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04) and the meta-classifier model (slope of predicted-to-observed events, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.02), with more precise classification across the risk spectrum. The XGBoost model reclassified 32 393 of 121 839 individuals (27%) and the meta-classifier model reclassified 30 836 of 121 839 individuals (25%) deemed at moderate to high risk for death in logistic regression as low risk, which were more consistent with the observed event rates. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study using a large national registry, none of the tested machine learning models were associated with substantive improvement in the discrimination of in-hospital mortality after AMI, limiting their clinical utility. However, compared with logistic regression, XGBoost and meta-classifier models, but not the neural network, offered improved resolution of risk for high-risk individuals. This cohort study evaluates whether contemporary machine learning methods can facilitate prediction of death from acute myocardial infarction by including a larger number of variables and identifying complex relationships between predictors and outcomes. Question Do contemporary machine learning methods improve prediction of in-hospital death after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI)? Findings In this cohort study of 755 402 patients with AMI in a nationwide registry, machine learning models that used the same data inputs as logistic regression were not associated with substantially improved prediction of in-hospital mortality after AMI. Two of these models, extreme gradient descent boosting and meta-classifier, however, were associated with improved calibration across the risk spectrum, reclassifying 1 in every 4 patients deemed to be at moderate or high risk for death in logistic regression accurately as low risk, consistent with the actual observed risk. Meaning These findings suggest that machine learning models are not associated with substantially better prediction of risk of death after AMI but may offer greater resolution of risk, which can better clarify the individual risk for adverse outcomes.

The pathophysiological boundaries of these phenotypes are unclear, limiting treatment stratification. Machine learning can identify groups with similar features using multidimensional data. Here, to classify MS subtypes based on pathological features, we apply unsupervised machine learning to brain MRI scans acquired in previously published studies. We use a training dataset from 6322 MS patients to define MRI-based subtypes and an independent cohort of 3068 patients for validation. Based on the earliest abnormalities, we define MS subtypes as cortex-led, normal-appearing white matter-led, and lesion-led. People with the lesion-led subtype have the highest risk of confirmed disability progression (CDP) and the highest relapse rate. People with the lesion-led MS subtype show positive treatment response in selected clinical trials. Our findings suggest that MRI-based subtypes predict MS disability progression and response to treatment and may be used to define groups of patients in interventional trials. Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous progressive disease. Here, the authors use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to determine multiple sclerosis subtypes, progression, and response to potential therapeutic treatments based on neuroimaging data.

The survey of the applications in seismology presented here serves as a catalyst for further use of ML. Five research areas in seismology are surveyed in which ML classification, regression, clustering algorithms show promise: earthquake detection and phase picking, earthquake early warning (EEW), ground-motion prediction, seismic tomography, and earthquake geodesy. We conclude by discussing the need for a hybrid approach combining data-driven ML with traditional physical modeling.

This method uses support vector classification to first separate metals from nonmetals, followed by quantitatively predicting the band gap of the nonmetals using support vector regression. The superb accuracy of the regression model is obtained by using a training set composed entirely of experimentally measured band gaps and utilizing only compositional descriptors. In fact, because of the unique training set of experimental data, the machine learning predicted band gaps are significantly closer to the experimentally reported values than DFT (PBE-level) calculated band gaps. Not only does this resulting tool provide the ability to accurately predict the band gap for any composition but also the versatility and speed of the prediction based only on composition will make this a great resource to screen inorganic phase space and direct the development of functional inorganic materials.

It is a very important part of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM). In this article, a new performance degradation prediction (HMEPEM) method based on high-order differential mathematical morphology gradient spectrum entropy (HOMMSE), phase space reconstruction, and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to predict the performance degradation trend of rolling bearings. In the proposed HMEPEM method, the HOMMSE method is used to extract the initial features of performance degradation from the raw bearing vibration signals and divide working stages. Then the phase space reconstruction is used to further extract more useful features from the initial features of performance degradation in order to construct a feature matrix, which is input into the ELM in order to build the performance degradation prediction model for predicting the performance degradation trend of rolling bearings. The proposed HMEPEM method is validated on the performance degradation data of rolling bearings provided by the PRONOSTIA platform. The results show that the proposed HMEPEM method can efficiently track the evolution of degradation and predict the performance degradation trend of rolling bearings.

Gully initiation and development is a natural process that greatly impacts natural resources, agricultural activities, and environmental quality as it promotes land and water degradation, ecosystem disruption, and intensification of hazards. In this research, an attempt is made to produce gully erosion susceptibility maps for the management of hazard-prone areas in the Pathro River Basin of India using four well-known machine learning models, namely, multivariate additive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), random forest ( RF), and support vector machine (SVM). To support this effort, observations from 174 gully erosion sites were made using field surveys. Of the 174 observations, 70% were randomly split into a training data set to build susceptibility models and the remaining 30% were used to validate the newly built models. Twelve gully erosion conditioning factors were assessed to find the areas most susceptible to gully erosion. The predisposing factors were slope gradient, altitude, plan curvature, slope aspect, land use, slope length (LS), topographical wetness index (TWI), drainage density, soil type, distance from the river, distance from the lineament, and distance from the road. Finally, the results from the four applied models were validated with the help of ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves. The AUC value for the RF model was calculated to be 96.2%, whereas for those for the FDA, MARS, and SVM models were 842%, 91.4%, and 88.3%, respectively. The AUC results indicated that the random forest model had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the MARS, SVM, and FDA models. However, it could be concluded that all the machine learning models performed well according to their prediction accuracy. The produced GESMs can be very useful for land managers and policy makers as they can be used to initiate remedial measures and erosion hazard mitigation in prioritized areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is difficult to forecast the areas that are vulnerable to flash flooding due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flash floods. Therefore, earlier identification of flash flood susceptible sites can be performed using advanced machine learning models for managing flood disasters. In this study, we applied and assessed two new hybrid ensemble models, namely Dagging and Random Subspace (RS) coupled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which are the other three state of-the-art machine learning models for modelling flood susceptibility maps at the Teesta River basin, the northern region of Bangladesh. The application of thesemodels includes twelve flood influencing factorswith 413 current and former flooding points, which were transferred in a GIS environment. The information gain ratio, the multicollinearity diagnostics tests were employed to determine the association between the occurrences and flood influential factors. For the validation and the comparison of these models, for the ability to predict the statistical appraisal measures such as Freidman, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and t-paired tests and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) were employed. The value of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC was above 0.80 for all models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the Dagging model performs superior, followed by RF, the ANN, the SVM, and the RS, then the several benchmark models. The approach and solution-oriented outcomes outlined in this paper will assist state and local authorities as well as policy makers in reducing flood-related threats and will also assist in the implementation of effective mitigation strategies to mitigate future damage.

A common approach to go beyond the time- and length-scales accessible with such computationally expensive simulations is the definition of coarse-grained molecular models. Existing coarse-graining approaches define an effective interaction potential to match defined properties of high-resolution models or experimental data. In this paper, we reformulate coarse-graining as a supervised machine learning problem. We use statistical learning theory to decompose the coarse-graining error and cross-validation to select and compare the performance of different models. We introduce CGnets, a deep learning approach, that learns coarse-grained free energy functions and can be trained by a force-matching scheme. CGnets maintain all physically relevant invariances and allow one to incorporate prior physics knowledge to avoid sampling of unphysical structures. We show that CGnets can capture all-atom explicit-solvent free energy surfaces with models using only a few coarse-grained beads and no solvent, while classical coarse-graining methods fail to capture crucial features of the free energy surface. Thus, CGnets are able to capture multibody terms that emerge from the dimensionality reduction.

Techniques based on machine-learning ideas for interpolating the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface without explicitly describing electrons have recently shown great promise, but accurately and efficiently fitting the physically relevant space of configurations remains a challenging goal. Here, we present a Gaussian approximation potential for silicon that achieves this milestone, accurately reproducing density-functional-theory reference results for a wide range of observable properties, including crystal, liquid, and amorphous bulk phases, as well as point, line, and plane defects. We demonstrate that this new potential enables calculations such as finite-temperature phase-boundary lines, self-diffusivity in the liquid, formation of the amorphous by slow quench, and dynamic brittle fracture, all of which are very expensive with a first-principles method. We show that the uncertainty quantification inherent to the Gaussian process regression framework gives a qualitative estimate of the potential's accuracy for a given atomic configuration. The success of this model shows that it is indeed possible to create a useful machine-learning-based interatomic potential that comprehensively describes a material on the atomic scale and serves as a template for the development of such models in the future.

This perspective summarizes insights, recent developments, and recommendations for infusing actionable computational evidence into clinical development and health care from academy, biotechnology industry, nonprofit foundations, regulators, and technology corporations. Analysis and learning from publically available biomedical and clinical trial data sets, real-world evidence from sensors, and health records by machine-learning architectures are discussed.

By using the LFD method, the parameter adjusting problem in the tracking controller is avoided. Consequently, a strategy can be provided to users with limited parameter adjusting experience. The kinematic tracking problem is formulated as a second-order system and the objective is to simultaneously reduce the errors in position and velocity. The extreme learning machines (ELM) algorithm is applied in the controller design. The velocity and position are utilized as the inputs and the output is the robot corrected kinematic movement. The controller parameters are learned from the desired human or programming demonstrations taking into consideration the stability constraints. In this work, we analyze the system local and global asymptotic stability in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulation comparisons and a practical experiment using a KUKA robot manipulator.

In recent decades, advances in the Human Machine Interface (HMI) have improved from tactile sensors, such as touchpads and joysticks, to now include the accurate detection of dexterous body movements in more diversified and sophisticated devices. Advancements in highly adaptive machine learning techniques, neural interfaces, and neuromorphic sensing have generated the potential for an economic and feasible solution for next-generation applications such as wearable HMIs with intimate and multi-directional sensing capabilities. This review offers a general knowledge of HMI technologies beginning with tactile sensors and their piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric sensing mechanisms. A further discussion is given on how machine learning, neural interfaces, and neuromorphic electronics can be used to enhance next-generation HMIs in an upcoming 5 G infrastructure and advancements in the internet of things and artificial intelligence of things in the near future. The efficient interactions with kinetic and physiological signals from human body through the fusion of tactile sensor and neural electronics will bring a revolution to both the advanced manipulation and medical rehabilitation.

In this regard, the field of phage biology has embraced machine learning to elucidate and predict phage- host interactions, based on receptor-binding proteins, (anti-) defense systems, prophage detection, and life cycle recognition. Here, we highlight the enormous potential of integrating information from omics data with insights from systems biology to better understand phage-host interactions. We conceptualize and discuss the potential of a multilayer model that mirrors the phage infection process, integrating adsorption, bacterial pan-immune components and hijacking of the bacterial metabolism to predict phage infectivity. In the future, this model can offer insights into the underlying mechanisms of the infection process, and digital phagograms can support phage cocktail design and phage engineering.

Thus, forecasting SMEs' credit risk in SCF has become one of the most critical issues in financing decision-making. Nevertheless, traditional credit risk forecasting models cannot meet the needs of such forecasting. Many researchers argue that machine learning (ML) approaches are good tools. Here we propose an enhanced hybrid ensemble ML approach called RS-MultiBoosting by incorporating two classic ensemble ML approaches, random subspace (RS) and MultiBoosting, to improve the accuracy of forecasting SMEs' credit risk. The experimental samples, originating from data on forty-six quoted SMEs and seven quoted core enterprises (CEs) in the Chinese securities market between 31 March 2014 and 31 December 2015, are collected to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the RS-MultiBoosting approach. The forecasting result shows that RS-MultiBoosting has good performance in dealing with a small sample size. From the SCF perspective, the results suggest that to enhance SMEs' financing ability, 'traditional' factors, such as the current and quick ratio of SMEs, remain critical. Other SCF-specific factors, for instance, the features of trade goods and the CE's profit margin, play a significant role.

Cellular research reveals that the cerebellum involves a variety of sub-cell types, including Golgi, granule, interneuron, and unipolar brush cells. The functional characteristics of cerebellar cells exhibit considerable differences among diverse mammalian species, reflecting a potential development and evolution of nervous system. In this study, we aimed to recognize the transcriptional differences between human and mouse cerebellum in four cerebellar sub-cell types by using single-cell sequencing data and machine learning methods. A total of 321,387 single-cell sequencing data were used. The 321,387 cells included 4 cell types, i.e., Golgi (5,048, 1.57%), granule (250,307, 77.88%), interneuron (60,526, 18.83%), and unipolar brush (5,506, 1.72%) cells. Our results showed that by using gene expression profiles as features, the optimal classification model could achieve very high even perfect performance for Golgi, granule, interneuron, and unipolar brush cells, respectively, suggesting a remarkable difference between the genomic profiles of human and mouse. Furthermore, a group of related genes and rules contributing to the classification was identified, which might provide helpful information for deepening the understanding of cerebellar cell heterogeneity and evolution.

Irrespective of how a diagnostic tool is derived, it must be evaluated using a 3-step process of deriving, validating, and establishing the clinical effectiveness of the tool. Machine learning-based tools should also be assessed for the type of machine learning model used and its appropriateness for the input data type and data set size. Machine learning models also generally have additional prespecified settings called hyperparameters, which must be tuned on a data set independent of the validation set. On the validation set, the outcome against which the model is evaluated is termed the reference standard. The rigor of the reference standard must be assessed, such as against a universally accepted gold standard or expert grading.

It is the subject of active research in many fields of study, such as computer science, data science, statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Several clustering techniques have been proposed and implemented, and most of them successfully find excellent quality or optimal clustering results in the domains mentioned earlier. However, there has been a gradual shift in the choice of clustering methods among domain experts and practitioners alike, which is precipitated by the fact that most traditional clustering algorithms still depend on the number of clusters provided a priori. These conventional clustering algorithms cannot effectively handle real-world data clustering analysis problems where the number of clusters in data objects cannot be easily identified. Also, they cannot effectively manage problems where the optimal number of clusters for a high-dimensional dataset cannot be easily determined. Therefore, there is a need for improved, flexible, and efficient clustering techniques. Recently, a variety of efficient clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature, and these algorithms produced good results when evaluated on real-world clustering problems. This study presents an up-to-date systematic and comprehensive review of traditional and state-of-the-art clustering techniques for different domains. This survey considers clustering from a more practical perspective. It shows the outstanding role of clustering in various disciplines, such as education, marketing, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. It also discusses the application of clustering to different fields attracting intensive efforts among the scientific community, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics. This survey paper will be beneficial for both practitioners and researchers. It will serve as a good reference point for researchers and practitioners to design improved and efficient state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

The increasing presence of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in commercial buildings has resulted in a rising availability of high frequency interval data. These data can be used for a variety of energy efficiency applications such as demand response, fault detection and diagnosis, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) optimization. This large amount of data has also opened the door to the use of advanced statistical learning models, which hold promise for providing accurate building baseline energy consumption predictions, and thus accurate saving estimations. The gradient boosting machine is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is gaining considerable traction in a wide range of data driven applications, such as ecology, computer vision, and biology. In the present work an energy consumption baseline modeling method based on a gradient boosting machine was proposed. To assess the performance of this method, a recently published testing procedure was used on a large dataset of 410 commercial buildings. The model training periods were varied and several prediction accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance. The results show that using the gradient boosting machine model improved the R-squared prediction accuracy and the CV(RMSE) in more than 80 percent of the cases, when compared to an industry best practice model that is based on piecewise linear regression, and to a random forest algorithm.

For this purpose, a soft computing approach is adopted. Two novel intelligence methods, including an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a Genetic Programming (GP), are developed. In order to generate the required data for the intelligence methods, several push-out tests were conducted on various channel connectors at different temperatures. The dimension of the channel connectors, temperature, and slip are considered as the inputs of the models, and the strength of the connector is predicted as the output. Next, the performance of the ELM and GP is evaluated by developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Finally, the performance of the ELM, GP, and ANN is compared with each other. Results show that ELM is capable of achieving superior performance indices in comparison with GP and ANN in the case of load prediction. Also, it is found that ELM is not only a very fast algorithm but also a more reliable model.

J	Yaseen, ZM				Yaseen, Zaher Mundher			An insight into machine learning models era in simulating soil, water bodies and adsorption heavy metals: Review, challenges and solutions	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Review						Heavy metals; Machine learning models; Review; Modeling development; Environmental prospective; Contamination	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; REMOVAL; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; ANN; ACCURACY	The development of computer aid models for heavy metals (HMs) simulation has been remarkably advanced over the past two decades. Several machine learning (ML) models have been developed for modeling HMs over the past two decades with outstanding progress. Although there have been a noticeable number of diverse ML models investigations, it is essential to have an informative vision on the progression of those computer aid models. In the current short review covering the simulation of heavy metals in contaminated soil, water bodies and removal from aqueous solution, numerous aspects on the methodological and conceptual HMs modeling are reviewed and discussed in detail. For instance, the limitation of the classical analytical methods, types of heavy metal dataset, necessity for new versions of ML models exploration, HM input parameters selection, ML models internal parameters tuning, performance metrics selection and the types of the modelled HM. The current review provides few outlooks in understanding the underlying od the ML models application for HM simulation. Tackling these modeling aspects is significantly essential for ML developers and environmental scientists to obtain creditability and scientific consistency in the domain of environmental science. Based on the discussed modeling aspects, it was concluded several future research directions, which will promote environmental scientists for better understanding of the underlying HMs simulation.

J	Amiri, M; Pourghasemi, HR; Ghanbarian, GA; Afzali, SF				Amiri, Mandis; Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza; Ghanbarian, Gholam Abbas; Afzali, Sayed Fakhreddin			Assessment of the importance of gully erosion effective factors using Boruta algorithm and its spatial modeling and mapping using three machine learning algorithms	GEODERMA			English	Article						Gully erosion; Machine learning; Boruta algorithm; Evidential belief function; Integrating GIS and R	ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; BINARY LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; EVIDENTIAL BELIEF FUNCTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; LINEAR EROSION; DECISION TREES; ENSEMBLE; INITIATION; RESOLUTION	The Maharloo watershed has witnessed many gullies in the recent due to the specific topo-climatic conditions and man-made activities in that area. The present study is set out to address this issue by producing gully erosion prediction maps via three machine learning algorithms including RF, SVM and BRT in Maharloo watershed, Fars province, Iran. Also, this research attempted to consider the importance of effective factors in the occurrence of gully erosion using Boruta algorithm. To this end, gully erosion locations were identified by extensive field surveys as well as the use of already prepared gully raster map of Maharloo watershed. Then, sixteen causative factors of gully erosion such as elevation, slope degree, slope aspect, plan curvature, TWI, distance from rivers, distance from roads, drainage density, lithology, annual mean rainfall, NDVI, land use and some soil characteristics (pH, clay percent, electrical conductivity-EC, and silt percent) were identified and their maps were produced and classified in the GIS. In this study, the relationships among each agent and gully erosion were defined employing the evidential belief function (EBF) algorithm and the weight of each factor's classes was determined. On the other hand, the results of the collinearity test among the factors showed that sand percentage agent had a VIF > 5; therefore, this covariate was removed from the model. Also, the results of the importance of effective factors using Boruta algorithm indicated that three factors including land use, distance from river, and clay percent had the most noticeable importance in the occurrence of gully erosion in the study area. Finally, the gully erosion susceptibility maps were produced using the RF, BRT, and SVM models in the R statistical software. The results of machine learning techniques were evaluated employing 30% of unused locations in the modeling process as well as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Also, in the current research, try to assess the fitting performance of models and their robustness using sensitivity rate, specificity rate, Cohen's Kappa, and 4-fold cross-validation measures. Results showed that the final gully erosion susceptibility maps had an excellent accuracy with AUC values of validation data sets by scenarios 7 and 9 independent factors on gully erosion, respectively (SVM = 0.957, 0.975, RF = 0.991, 0.986, BRT = 0.913, 0.913). The fitting performance measures and robustness technique (4-fold cross-validation) also confirmed the achieved validation results. In order to control and prevent this type of erosion in the Maharloo watershed, there should be protective actions and watershed management measures in place at the primary stages, especially at the beginning of the gully erosion, to control the development of the gully erosion.

However, sufficiently labeled data are indispensable for extracting intertask relationships before transferring knowledge in classical supervised LML systems. Inadequate labels may deteriorate the performance due to the poor initial approximation. In order to extend the typical LML system, we propose a novel hierarchical lifelong learning algorithm (HLLA) consisting of two following layers: 1) the knowledge layer consisted of shared representations and integrated knowledge basis at the bottom and 2) parameterized hypothesis functions with features at the top. Unlabeled data is leveraged in HLLA for pretraining of the shared representations. We also have considered a selective inherited updating method to deal with intertask distribution shifting. Experiments show that our HLLA method outperforms many other recent LML algorithms, especially when dealing with higher dimensional, lower correlation, and fewer labeled data problems.

Prediction of higher-selectivity catalysts by computer-driven worlflow and machine learning	SCIENCE			English	Article							QUATERNARY AMMONIUM-IONS; DIELS-ALDER REACTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DESIGN; BINOL; ACIDS; ENANTIOSELECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; COMPLEXES; LIGANDS	Catalyst design in asymmetric reaction development has traditionally been driven by empiricism, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively recognize structural patterns to improve selectivity. Machine learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral catalyst selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the catalyst scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train machine learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector machines and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed thiol addition to N-acylimines.

Predicting reaction performance in C-N cross-coupling using machine learning	SCIENCE			English	Article							DISCOVERY; TOOL	Machine learning methods are becoming integral to scientific inquiry in numerous disciplines. We demonstrated that machine learning can be used to predict the performance of a synthetic reaction in multidimensional chemical space using data obtained via high-throughput experimentation. We created scripts to compute and extract atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors for the components of a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling of aryl halides with 4-methylaniline in the presence of various potentially inhibitory additives. Using these descriptors as inputs and reaction yield as output, we showed that a random forest algorithm provides significantly improved predictive performance over linear regression analysis. The random forest model was also successfully applied to sparse training sets and out-of-sample prediction, suggesting its value in facilitating adoption of synthetic methodology.

For this purpose, an experimental database consisting of 1030 records has been compiled from the machine learning repository of the University of California, Irvine. The database was used to train and validate four conventional machine learning (CML) models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear and Non-Linear Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS-L and MARS-C), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR). Subsequently, the predicted outputs of CML models were combined and trained using ANN to construct the Hybrid Ensemble Model (HENSM). It is observed that the proposed HENSM produces higher predictive accuracy compared to the CML models used in the present study. The predictive performance of all models for CS prediction was compared using the testing dataset and it is found that the HENSM model attained the highest predictive accuracy in both phases. Based on the experimental results, the newly constructed HENSM model is very potential to be a new alternative in handling the overfitting issues of CML models and hence, can be used to predict the concrete CS, including the design of less polluting and more sustainable concrete constructions.

For the present machine-learning-based data reconstruction, we use the downsampled skip-connection/multiscale model based on a convolutional neural network, incorporating the multiscale nature of fluid flows into its network structure. As an initial example, the model is applied to the two-dimensional cylinder wake at . The reconstructed flow fields by the present method show great agreement with the reference data obtained by direct numerical simulation. Next, we apply the current model to a two-dimensional decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The machine-learned model is able to track the decaying evolution from spatial and temporal coarse input data. The proposed concept is further applied to a complex turbulent channel flow over a three-dimensional domain at . The present model reconstructs high-resolved turbulent flows from very coarse input data in space, and also reproduces the temporal evolution for appropriately chosen time interval. The dependence on the number of training snapshots and duration between the first and last frames based on a temporal two-point correlation coefficient are also assessed to reveal the capability and robustness of spatio-temporal super resolution reconstruction. These results suggest that the present method can perform a range of flow reconstructions in support of computational and experimental efforts.

It contains pre-defined workflows for image segmentation, object classification, counting and tracking. Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by interactively providing sparse training annotations for a non-linear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five dimensions (3D, time and number of channels). Its computational back end runs operations on-demand wherever possible, allowing for interactive prediction on data larger than RAM. Once the classifiers are trained, ilastik workflows can be applied to new data from the command line without further user interaction. We describe all ilastik workflows in detail, including three case studies and a discussion on the expected performance.

Specifically, we provide a review of intrusion detection systems based on deep learning approaches. The dataset plays an important role in intrusion detection, therefore we describe 35 well-known cyber datasets and provide a classification of these datasets into seven categories; namely, network traffic-based dataset, electrical network-based dataset, internet traffic-based dataset, virtual private network-based dataset, android apps-based dataset, IoT traffic-based dataset, and internet-connected devices-based dataset. We analyze seven deep learning models including recurrent neural networks, deep neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, deep Boltzmann machines, and deep autoencoders. For each model, we study the performance in two categories of classification (binary and multiclass) under two new real traffic datasets, namely, the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and the Bot-IoT dataset. In addition, we use the most important performance indicators, namely, accuracy, false alarm rate, and detection rate for evaluating the efficiency of several methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially, human concept learning not only is a static process in human cognition but also can vary gradually with dynamic environments. Nevertheless, the classical SSL algorithms must be redesigned to accommodate newly input data. In this sense, concept-cognitive learning may be a good choice, as it can implement dynamic processes by imitating human cognitive processes. Meanwhile, numerous SSL methods were designed based on the feature vector information of instances, while ignoring concept structural information that is a very important process in human knowledge organization. Based on this idea, a novel SSL method, named semi-supervised concept learning method (S2CL), is proposed for dynamic SSL by employing concept spaces, in which knowledge is represented by hierarchical concept structures. Moreover, to make full use of the global and local conceptual information, we further propose an extended version of S2CL (namely, S2CL(alpha)) for concept learning. More specifically, to effectively exploit the unlabeled data, this paper first shows some new related theories for S2CL (or S2CL(alpha)) based on a regular formal decision context; then a novel SSL framework is designed, and its corresponding algorithm is developed. Finally, we conduct some experiments on various datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, which include concept classification and incremental learning under a large quantity of unlabeled data.

J	Yang, Y; He, K; Wang, YP; Yuan, ZZ; Yin, YH; Guo, MZ				Yang, Yang; He, Kun; Wang, Yun-peng; Yuan, Zhen-zhou; Yin, Yong-hao; Guo, Man-ze			Identification of dynamic traffic crash risk for cross-area freeways based on statistical and machine learning methods	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Freeway; Cross-area scenario; Real-time traffic crash precursors; Dynamic risk identification; Statistical models; Machine learning	MONTE-CARLO; FLOW; IMPACTS; MODELS	Freeway traffic safety should be given great attention due to the frequent and serious consequences that arise from freeway traffic crashes. With the possibility of obtaining high resolution traffic big data, traditional freeway safety promotion methods are gradually replaced by the emerging technology of active safety control based on the real-time traffic data. However, there is still a lack of cross-area pertinence towards dynamic traffic safety currently. To overcome the defects of existing dynamic traffic crash precursors identification studies and provide precise theoretical basis for freeway dynamic safety control, this research took cross-area freeways as the research object. Firstly, based on the LOS (level of service) A-F theory and the consideration of area types, six units to be evaluated were generated (two dimensions totally: saturated/unsaturated flow, urban/suburban/mountainous). Then, conditional logistic regression based on Markov chain Monte Carlo method was adopted to quantitatively evaluate the dynamic risk of cross-area freeways. Finally, 20 related traffic flow variables were extracted from five dimensions which can reflect the dynamic traffic flow characteristics, and the machine learning approaches including random forest algorithm and Bayesian logistics regression were applied for analysis and modeling; then, crash precursors were identified for each type of freeway area, and the statistical relationship between traffic flow variables and crash risk was established via the statistical models. The results show the area types and traffic conditions of freeway are significantly correlated with dynamic traffic safety, and the crash risk in the urban area/saturated flow condition is the highest, which is 29.6 times of that in the condition of suburban area/unsaturated flow. When the traffic operates at the freeway of urban/unsaturated flow, the formation of small fleets and the lane changing behavior play a dominant role influencing crash risk; when operating at urban/saturated flow, frequent acceleration or deceleration in the fleet and frequent lane changes during the formation of the fleet have great impact towards crash risk. When traffic operates at suburban/unsaturated flow, the main crash precursors are the sudden change of occupancy and volume in a short period, as well as the formation of a small fleet. When operating at suburban/saturated flow, the crash-prone variables are the sudden increase of speed and occupancy in a short period and the change of volume. When traffic operates at mountainous/unsaturated flow, the changes of speed and occupancy in a short period and the formation of small fleets are the main factors influencing crash. When operating at mountainous/saturated flow, lane changing behavior, the sudden increase of volume, and the speed mutation of some vehicles in saturated flow are the significant precursors. The results indicate every area type of freeway has a different mechanism of traffic crash. Moreover, with the consideration of freeway area types and traffic state differences, the machine learning and statistical com-bination models proposed in this research can identify the relationship and mechanism between dynamic traffic flow characteristics and traffic safety more comprehensively and accurately, and the identification results in this research can refer to the further dynamic crash prediction work for cross-area freeway.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Review						deep learning; genomics; precision medicine; machine learning	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION; ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; COMPUTER-AIDED DETECTION; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; GENE-EXPRESSION; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; DRUG DISCOVERY; DECISION-SUPPORT; RESIDUE CONTACTS	Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.

We aim to determine whether clinical MRI can stratify these molecular subtypes to benefit the diagnosis and monitoring of gliomas. Experimental Design: The data from 456 subjects with gliomas were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive. Overall, 214 subjects, including 106 cases of glioblastomas and 108 cases of lower grade gliomas with preoperative MRI, survival data, histology, IDH, and 1p/19q status were included. We proposed a three-level machine-learning model based on multimodal MR radiomics to classify glioma subtypes. An independent dataset with 70 glioma subjects was further collected to verify the model performance. Results: The IDH and 1p/19q status of gliomas can be classified by radiomics and machine-learning approaches, with areas under ROC curves between 0.922 and 0.975 and accuracies between 87.7% and 96.1% estimated on the training dataset. The test on the validation dataset showed a comparable model performance with that on the training dataset, suggesting the efficacy of the trained classifiers. The classification of 5 molecular subtypes solely based on the MR phenotypes achieved an 81.8% accuracy, and a higher accuracy of 89.2% could be achieved if the histology diagnosis is available. Conclusions: The MR radiomics-based method provides a reliable alternative to determine the histology and molecular subtypes of gliomas. (C) 2018 AACR.

The fact that we have so many materials opens many exciting avenues but also create new challenges. We simply have too many materials to be processed using conventional, brute force, methods. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations. The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. 'We show how to select appropriate training sets, survey approaches that are used to represent these materials in feature space, and review different learning architectures, as well as evaluation and interpretation strategies. In the second part, we review how the different approaches of machine learning have been applied to porous materials. In particular, we discuss applications in the field of gas storage and separation, the stability of these materials, their electronic properties, and their synthesis. Given the increasing interest of the scientific community in machine learning, we expect this list to rapidly expand in the coming years.

We introduce an atom-centered, symmetry-adapted framework to machine-learn the valence charge density based on a small number of reference calculations. The model is highly transferable, meaning it can be trained on electronic-structure data of small molecules and used to predict the charge density of larger compounds with low, linear-scaling cost. Applications are shown for various hydrocarbon molecules of increasing complexity and flexibility, and demonstrate the accuracy of the model when predicting the density on octane and octatetraene after training exclusively on butane and butadiene. This transferable, data-driven model can be used to interpret experiments, accelerate electronic structure calculations, and compute electrostatic interactions in molecules and condensed-phase systems.

Yet, existing reviews remain limited due to the piecemeal insights offered through a sub-set rather than the entire corpus of sustainable finance. To address this gap, this study aims to conduct a large-scale review that would provide a state-of-the-art overview of the performance and intellectual structure of sustainable finance. To do so, this study engages in a review of sustainable finance research using big data analytics through machine learning of scholarly research. In doing so, this study unpacks the most influential articles and top contributing journals, authors, institutions, and countries, as well as the methodological choices and research contexts for sustainable finance research. In addition, this study reveals insights into seven major themes of sustainable finance research, namely socially responsible investing, climate financing, green financing, impact investing, carbon financing, energy financing, and governance of sustainable financing and investing. To drive the field forward, this study proposes several suggestions for future sustainable finance research, which include developing and diffusing innovative sustainable financing instruments, magnifying and managing the profitability and returns of sustainable financing, making sustainable finance more sustainable, devising and unifying policies and frameworks for sustainable finance, tackling greenwashing of corporate sustainability reporting in sustainable finance, shining behavioral finance on sustainable finance, and leveraging the power of new-age technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things, and machine learning for sustainable finance.

To mitigate this problem, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the characteristics of first-arrival earthquake P waves, using 300,000 waveforms recorded in southern California and Japan. We apply the GAN critic as an automatic feature extractor and train a Random Forest classifier with about 700,000 earthquake and noise waveforms. We show that the discriminator can recognize 99.2% of the earthquake P waves and 98.4% of the noise signals. This state-of-the-art performance is expected to reduce significantly the number of false triggers from local impulsive noise. Our study demonstrates that GANs can discover a compact and effective representation of seismic waves, which has the potential for wide applications in seismology. Plain Language Summary Earthquake early warning systems are sometimes accidentally triggered by impulsive noise signals, rather than by real earthquake signals, which leads to false alerts. This may cause unnecessary economic loss and public concern. Here we use machine learning tools to determine if the waveforms are generated by earthquakes or local noise sources. We train the algorithms with about 700,000 waveforms recorded by southern California and Japan. We demonstrate that the trained machine learning discriminator can recognize 99.2% of the earthquakes and 98.4% of the noise. This discriminator can reduce a large number of false alerts and significantly improve the robustness of early warning systems.

J	Grisafi, A; Wilkins, DM; Csanyi, G; Ceriotti, M				Grisafi, Andrea; Wilkins, David M.; Csanyi, Gabor; Ceriotti, Michele			Symmetry-Adapted Machine Learning for Tensorial Properties of Atomistic Systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							CONDENSED-PHASE; WATER; SPECTROSCOPY; DYNAMICS; POLARIZABILITY; SCATTERING; MOLECULES; SCIENCE; LIQUIDS	Statistical learning methods show great promise in providing an accurate prediction of materials and molecular properties, while minimizing the need for computationally demanding electronic structure calculations. The accuracy and transferability of these models are increased significantly by encoding into the learning procedure the fundamental symmetries of rotational and permutational invariance of scalar properties. However, the prediction of tensorial properties requires that the model respects the appropriate geometric transformations, rather than invariance, when the reference frame is rotated. We introduce a formalism that extends existing schemes and makes it possible to perform machine learning of tensorial properties of arbitrary rank, and for general molecular geometries. To demonstrate it, we derive a tensor kernel adapted to rotational symmetry, which is the natural generalization of the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel commonly used for the prediction of scalar properties at the atomic scale. The performance and generality of the approach is demonstrated by learning the instantaneous response to an external electric field of water oligomers of increasing complexity, from the isolated molecule to the condensed phase.

J	Verrelst, J; Berger, K; Rivera-Caicedo, JP				Verrelst, Jochem; Berger, Katja; Rivera-Caicedo, Juan Pablo			Intelligent Sampling for Vegetation Nitrogen Mapping Based on Hybrid Machine Learning Algorithms	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Active learning (AL); Gaussian processes (GP); hybrid retrieval methods; kernel ridge regression (KRR); nitrogen	GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES; BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS; RETRIEVAL; REGRESSION; CANOPY; REFLECTANCE; VARIABLES	Upcoming satellite imaging spectroscopy missions will deliver spatiotemporal explicit data streams to be exploited for mapping vegetation properties, such as nitrogen (N) content. Within retrieval workflows for real-time mapping over agricultural regions, such crop-specific information products need to be derived precisely and rapidly. To allow fast processing, intelligent sampling schemes for training databases should be incorporated to establish efficient machine learning (ML) models. In this study, we implemented active learning (AL) heuristics using kernel ridge regression (KRR) to minimize and optimize a training database for variational heteroscedastic Gaussian processes regression (VHGPR) to estimate aboveground N content. Several uncertainty and diversity criteria were applied on a lookup table (LUT) composed of aboveground N content and corresponding hyperspectral reflectance simulated by the PROSAIL-PRO model. The best-performing AL criteria were Euclidian distance-based diversity (EBD) resulting in a reduction of the LUT training data set by 81% (50 initial samples plus 141 samples selected from a pool of 1000 samples). This reduced LUT was used for training VHGPR, which is not only a competitive algorithm but also provides uncertainty estimates. Validation against in situ N reference data provided excellent results with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.84 g/m(2) and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.92. Mapping aboveground N content over an agricultural region yielded reliable estimates and meaningful associated uncertainties. These promising results encourage the transfer of such hybrid workflows into space and time within the frame of future operational N monitoring from satellite imaging spectroscopy data.

J	Chia, MY; Huang, YF; Koo, CH				Chia, Min Yan; Huang, Yuk Feng; Koo, Chai Hoon			Swarm-based optimization as stochastic training strategy for estimation of reference evapotranspiration using extreme learning machine	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Extreme learning machine; Reference evapotranspiration; Particle swarm optimization; Moth-flame optimization; Whale optimization algorithm; Fitness function	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; PERFORMANCE; MODELS; ERROR	Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is usually calculated as a pre-requisite to obtain the actual evapotranspiration (ET). Estimation of ET0 using extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new norm due to its excellent computation efficiency and its lower data dependency. However, the lack of stochastic tuning often results in the convergence to the local optima instead of the global optimum. This study attempts to address this issue by hybridizing the ELM with three swarm-based optimization algorithms, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the moth-flame optimization (MFO) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) with different fitness functions. This study was conducted with three stations in Sabah and Sarawak (states in East Malaysia) as this region is to a very large extent covered with oil palm plantation. The water resources management is thus rather crucial for the area. The results showed that the WOA-ELM achieved a higher average rank score relative to the PSO-ELM and MFO-ELM, especially when the simple Taylor skill score was used as the fitness function. The application of different fitness functions did not show any significant effect. The reported standard deviations of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) for the three variations of the hybridized ELM were close to 0; thus reflecting their similarity in accuracy. However, in terms of computational efficiency, the simple Taylor skill score exhibited better stability where it could effectively reduce the number of required hidden neurons when the input meteorological parameters were decreased. The WOA was suggested as the best optimization algorithm for this study. For the three stations, respectively it achieved an average MAE, RMSE and R-2 of 0.0007 to 0.1443, 0.0011 to 0.1927 and 1.0000 to 0.9486, from cases C1 to C6 with minimum time cost.

Northwell COVID-19 Res Consortium	A Machine Learning Prediction Model of Respiratory Failure Within 48 Hours of Patient Admission for COVID-19: Model Development and Validation	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						artificial intelligence; prognostic; model; pandemic; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; modeling; development; validation; COVID-19; machine learning	OUTCOMES	Background: Predicting early respiratory failure due to COVID-19 can help triage patients to higher levels of care, allocate scarce resources, and reduce morbidity and mortality by appropriately monitoring and treating the patients at greatest risk for deterioration. Given the complexity of COVID-19, machine learning approaches may support clinical decision making for patients with this disease. Objective: Our objective is to derive a machine learning model that predicts respiratory failure within 48 hours of admission based on data from the emergency department. Methods: Data were collected from patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Northwell Health acute care hospitals and were discharged, died, or spent a minimum of 48 hours in the hospital between March 1 and May 11, 2020. Of 11,525 patients, 933 (8.1%) were placed on invasive mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of admission. Variables used by the models included clinical and laboratory data commonly collected in the emergency department. We trained and validated three predictive models (two based on XGBoost and one that used logistic regression) using cross-hospital validation. We compared model performance among all three models as well as an established early warning score (Modified Early Warning Score) using receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves, and other metrics. Results: The XGBoost model had the highest mean accuracy (0.919; area under the curve=0.77), outperforming the other two models as well as the Modified Early Warning Score. Important predictor variables included the type of oxygen delivery used in the emergency department, patient age, Emergency Severity Index level, respiratory rate, serum lactate, and demographic characteristics. Conclusions: The XGBoost model had high predictive accuracy, outperforming other early warning scores. The clinical plausibility and predictive ability of XGBoost suggest that the model could be used to predict 48-hour respiratory failure in admitted patients with COVID-19.

J	Rudin, C				Rudin, Cynthia			Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead	NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							RECIDIVISM; CAPACITY	Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision. There has been a recent rise of interest in developing methods for 'explainable AI', where models are created to explain how a first 'black box' machine learning model arrives at a specific decision. It can be argued that instead efforts should be directed at building inherently interpretable models in the first place, in particular where they are applied in applications that directly affect human lives, such as in healthcare and criminal justice.

Digital twin for oil pipeline risk estimation using prognostic and machine learning techniques	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION			English	Review						Oil pipeline; Risk probability rate; Digital twin; Prognostic-manifold learning	UNSTABLE PROCESSES; REAL-TIME; DESIGN; FLOW; CONTROLLER; SYSTEM; SENSOR	Digital Twin technology is emerging as the digitization platform to enhance the industrial information processing and management in concern with virtual and physical entities. It paves the path for integrated industrial data analysis by combining IoT and Artificial Intelligence for better data interpretation. At present in oil industry, pipelines prevail to be feasible mode, the risk probability rate is getting increased and maintenance system becomes difficult with attention to the earlier prediction of accidents risks by undertaking entire pipeline. This paper aims to provide the frame structure of Digital Twin based on machine learning and prognostics algorithms model to analyze and predict the risk probability rate of oil pipeline system. Prognostics focuses on the detection of a failure precursor by estimating risk condition with respect to the pressure data towards the evaluation of remaining useful life (RUL). The abnormality of pressure attribute is taken in prognostic analysis for risk probability estimation followed by Dirichlet Process Clustering and Canopy clustering to segregate the abnormal pressure drop and rise. Using multiple oil substation data integration platform, the features are extracted using manifold learning methods and the best feature probability rates are evaluated using kernel based SVM algorithm to provide on-time control action on the entire oil pipeline system through efficient wireless data communication between server and the oil substations. As a result, the proposed work creates Virtual Intelligent Integrated Automated Control System to predict the risk rate in oil industry by integrating entire transmission lines through enhanced wireless information networks in remote locations.

In this study, an experimental investigation is carried out to evaluate the performance and exhaust emissions of a single cylinder diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends. The engine performance parameters evaluated are the brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency whereas the exhaust emission parameters evaluated are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and smoke opacity. Kernel-based extreme learning machine is used to predict the engine performance and exhaust emission parameters of the fuel blends at full throttle conditions. Based on the experimental results, the brake specific fuel consumption is lower while the brake thermal efficiency is higher for the biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends. The carbon monoxide emissions and smoke opacity are also lower for these fuel blends. The mean absolute percentage error of the brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and smoke opacity is 1.363, 1.482, 4.597, 2.224, and 2.090%, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that K-ELM is a reliable method to estimate the engine performance and exhaust emission parameters of a single cylinder compression ignition engine fuelled with biodiesel-bioethanol-diesel blends to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.

Early use of effective antimicrobial treatments is critical for the outcome of infections and the prevention of treatment resistance. Antimicrobial resistance testing enables the selection of optimal antibiotic treatments, but current culture-based techniques can take up to 72 hours to generate results. We have developed a novel machine learning approach to predict antimicrobial resistance directly from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra profiles of clinical isolates. We trained calibrated classifiers on a newly created publicly available database of mass spectra profiles from the clinically most relevant isolates with linked antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes. This dataset combines more than 300,000 mass spectra with more than 750,000 antimicrobial resistance phenotypes from four medical institutions. Validation on a panel of clinically important pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, resulting in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80, 0.74 and 0.74, respectively, demonstrated the potential of using machine learning to substantially accelerate antimicrobial resistance determination and change of clinical management. Furthermore, a retrospective clinical case study of 63 patients found that implementing this approach would have changed the clinical treatment in nine cases, which would have been beneficial in eight cases (89%). MALDI-TOF mass spectra-based machine learning may thus be an important new tool for treatment optimization and antibiotic stewardship.

The problem currently is that traditional hydrological models degrade significantly in performance when calibrated for multiple basins together instead of for a single basin alone. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate that under a "big data" paradigm, this is not necessarily the case. By training a single LSTM model on 531 basins from the CAMELS dataset using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally, but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM (EA-LSTM), that allows for learning catchment similarities as a feature layer in a deep learning model. We show that these learned catchment similarities correspond well to what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.

However, many challenges arise since malicious attacks are continually changing and are occurring in very large volumes requiring a scalable solution. There are different malware datasets available publicly for further research by cyber security community. However, no existing study has shown the detailed analysis of the performance of various machine learning algorithms on various publicly available datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malware with continuously changing attacking methods, the malware datasets available publicly are to be updated systematically and benchmarked. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN), a type of deep learning model, is explored to develop a flexible and effective IDS to detect and classify unforeseen and unpredictable cyberattacks. The continuous change in network behavior and rapid evolution of attacks makes it necessary to evaluate various datasets which are generated over the years through static and dynamic approaches. This type of study facilitates to identify the best algorithm which can effectively work in detecting future cyberattacks. A comprehensive evaluation of experiments of DNNs and other classical machine learning classifiers are shown on various publicly available benchmark malware datasets. The optimal network parameters and network topologies for DNNs are chosen through the following hyperparameter selection methods with KDDCup 99 dataset. All the experiments of DNNs are run till 1,000 epochs with the learning rate varying in the range [0.01-0.5]. The DNN model which performed well on KDDCup 99 is applied on other datasets, such as NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto, WSN-DS, and CICIDS 2017, to conduct the benchmark. Our DNN model learns the abstract and high-dimensional feature representation of the IDS data by passing them into many hidden layers. Through a rigorous experimental testing, it is confirmed that DNNs perform well in comparison with the classical machine learning classifiers.

Models based on machine learning have emerged as a promising alternative to address these problems, but these models currently lack the precision to give crucial information on the magnitude of barrier heights, influence of solvents and catalysts and extent of regio- and chemoselectivity. Here, we construct hybrid models which combine the traditional transition state modelling and machine learning to accurately predict reaction barriers. We train a Gaussian Process Regression model to reproduce high-quality experimental kinetic data for the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction and use it to predict barriers with a mean absolute error of 0.77 kcal mol(-1) for an external test set. The model was further validated on regio- and chemoselectivity prediction on patent reaction data and achieved a competitive top-1 accuracy of 86%, despite not being trained explicitly for this task. Importantly, the model gives error bars for its predictions that can be used for risk assessment by the end user. Hybrid models emerge as the preferred alternative for accurate reaction prediction in the very common low-data situation where only 100-150 rate constants are available for a reaction class. With recent advances in deep learning for quickly predicting barriers and transition state geometries from density functional theory, we envision that hybrid models will soon become a standard alternative to complement current machine learning approaches based on ground-state physical organic descriptors or structural information such as molecular graphs or fingerprints.

Data-driven computational methods, especially machine learning (ML) approach, can rapidly and efficiently predict the utility of therapeutic peptides. ML methods offer an array of tools that can accelerate and enhance decision making and discovery for well-defined queries with ample and sophisticated data quality. Various ML approaches, such as support vector machines, random forest, extremely randomized tree, and more recently deep learning methods, are useful in peptide-based drug discovery. These approaches leverage the peptide data sets, created via high-throughput sequencing and computational methods, and enable the prediction of functional peptides with increased levels of accuracy. The use of ML approaches in the development of peptide-based therapeutics is relatively recent; however, these techniques are already revolutionizing protein research by unraveling their novel therapeutic peptide functions. In this review, we discuss several ML-based state-of-the-art peptide-prediction tools and compare these methods in terms of their algorithms, feature encodings, prediction scores, evaluation methodologies, and software utilities. We also assessed the prediction performance of these methods using well-constructed independent data sets. In addition, we discuss the common pitfalls and challenges of using ML approaches for peptide therapeutics. Overall, we show that using ML models in peptide research can streamline the development of targeted peptide therapies.

The accuracy, speed, and reliability of machine learning potentials, however, depend strongly on the way atomic configurations are represented, i.e., the choice of descriptors used as input for the machine learning method. The raw Cartesian coordinates are typically transformed in "fingerprints," or "symmetry functions," that are designed to encode, in addition to the structure, important properties of the potential energy surface like its invariances with respect to rotation, translation, and permutation of like atoms. Here we discuss automatic protocols to select a number of fingerprints out of a large pool of candidates, based on the correlations that are intrinsic to the training data. This procedure can greatly simplify the construction of neural network potentials that strike the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency and has the potential to accelerate by orders of magnitude the evaluation of Gaussian approximation potentials based on the smooth overlap of atomic positions kernel. We present applications to the construction of neural network potentials for water and for an Al-Mg-Si alloy and to the prediction of the formation energies of small organic molecules using Gaussian process regression.

Accelerated discovery of CO2 electrocatalysts using active machine learning	NATURE			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; ELECTROREDUCTION; ETHYLENE	The rapid increase in global energy demand and the need to replace carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting fossil fuels with renewable sources have driven interest in chemical storage of intermittent solar and wind energy(1,2). Particularly attractive is the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to chemical feedstocks, which uses both CO2 and renewable energy(3-8). Copper has been the predominant electrocatalyst for this reaction when aiming for more valuable multi-carbon products(9-16), and process improvements have been particularly notable when targeting ethylene. However, the energy efficiency and productivity (current density) achieved so far still fall below the values required to produce ethylene at cost-competitive prices. Here we describe Cu-Al electrocatalysts, identified using density functional theory calculations in combination with active machine learning, that efficiently reduce CO2 to ethylene with the highest Faradaic efficiency reported so far. This Faradaic efficiency of over 80 per cent (compared to about 66 per cent for pure Cu) is achieved at a current density of 400 milliamperes per square centimetre (at 1.5 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) and a cathodic-side (half-cell) ethylene power conversion efficiency of 55 +/- 2 per cent at 150 milliamperes per square centimetre. We perform computational studies that suggest that the Cu-Al alloys provide multiple sites and surface orientations with near-optimal CO binding for both efficient and selective CO2 reduction(17). Furthermore, in situ X-ray absorption measurements reveal that Cu and Al enable a favourable Cu coordination environment that enhances C-C dimerization. These findings illustrate the value of computation and machine learning in guiding the experimental exploration of multi-metallic systems that go beyond the limitations of conventional single-metal electrocatalysts.

An attractive alternative is to predict reactivity, although relevant approaches, such as computer-aided reaction design, are still in their infancy(2). Reaction prediction based on high-level quantum chemical methods is complex(3) even for simple molecules. Although machine learning is powerful for data analysis(4,5), its applications in chemistry are still being developed'. Inspired by strategies based on chemists' intuition, we propose that a reaction system controlled by a machine learning algorithm may be able to explore the space of chemical reactions quickly, especially if trained by an expert(8). Here we present an organic synthesis robot that can perform chemical reactions and analysis faster than they can be performed manually, as well as predict the reactivity of possible reagent combinations after conducting a small number of experiments, thus effectively navigating chemical reaction space. By using machine learning for decision making, enabled by binary encoding of the chemical inputs, the reactions can be assessed in real time using nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning system was able to predict the reactivity of about 1,000 reaction combinations with accuracy greater than 80 per cent after considering the outcomes of slightly over 10 per cent of the dataset. This approach was also used to calculate the reactivity of published datasets. Further, by using real-time data from our robot, these predictions were followed up manually by a chemist, leading to the discovery of four reactions.

Signed languages are not as pervasive a conversational medium as spoken languages due to the history of institutional suppression of the former and the linguistic hegemony of the latter. This has led to a communication barrier between signers and non-signers that could be mitigated by technology-mediated approaches. Here, we show that a wearable sign-to-speech translation system, assisted by machine learning, can accurately translate the hand gestures of American Sign Language into speech. The wearable sign-to-speech translation system is composed of yarn-based stretchable sensor arrays and a wireless printed circuit board, and offers a high sensitivity and fast response time, allowing real-time translation of signs into spoken words to be performed. By analysing 660 acquired sign language hand gesture recognition patterns, we demonstrate a recognition rate of up to 98.63% and a recognition time of less than 1 s.

Here, we introduce a machine-learning model, the Mixture Density Network (MDN), that largely outperforms existing algorithms when applied across different bio-optical regimes in inland and coastal waters. The model is trained and validated using a sizeable database of co-located Chla measurements (n = 2943) and in situ hyperspectral radiometric data resampled to simulate the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-2A/B and Sentinel-3A/B, respectively. Our performance evaluations of the model, via two-thirds of the in situ dataset with Chla ranging from 0.2 to 1209 mg/m(3) and a mean Chla of 21.7 mg/m(3), suggest significant improvements in Chla retrievals. For both MSI and OLCI, the mean absolute logarithmic error (MAE) and logarithmic bias (Bias) across the entire range reduced by 40-60%, whereas the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) and the median absolute percentage error (MAPE) improved two-to-three times over those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Using independent Chla matchups (n < 800) for Sentinel-2A/B and -3A, we show that the MDN model provides most accurate products from recorded images processed via three different atmospheric correction processors, namely the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), POLYMER, and ACOLITE, though the model is found to be sensitive to uncertainties in remote-sensing reflectance products. This manuscript serves as a preliminary study on a machine-learning algorithm with potential utility in seamless construction of Chla data records in inland and coastal waters, i.e., harmonized, comparable products via a single algorithm for MSI and OLCI data processing. The model performance is anticipated to enhance by improving the global representativeness of the training data as well as simultaneous retrievals of multiple optically active components of the water column.

J	Jamil, F; Iqbal, N; Ahmad, S; Kim, D				Jamil, Faisal; Iqbal, Naeem; Ahmad, Shabir; Kim, Dohyeun			Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Mechanism Based on Blockchain and Machine Learning for Sustainable Electrical Power Supply in Smart Grid	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Blockchain; Smart contracts; Predictive models; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Peer-to-peer computing; Energy consumption; Energy trading; energy prediction; predictive analysis; machine learning; blockchain	INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT; DEMAND RESPONSE; CHALLENGES; RECOMMENDATION; INTELLIGENCE; TECHNOLOGY; EVOLUTION; MODELS	It is expected that peer to peer energy trading will constitute a significant share of research in upcoming generation power systems due to the rising demand of energy in smart microgrids. However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid's load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model's performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform's effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is effectively used for energy crowdsourcing between the prosumer and consumer to attain service quality.

There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health.

Methods: Twitter data (N = 82,893) related to both older adults and COVID-19 and dated from January 23 to May 20, 2020, were analyzed. We used a combination of data science methods (including supervised machine learning, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis), qualitative thematic analysis, and conventional statistics. Results: The most common category in the coded tweets was "personal opinions" (66.2%), followed by "informative" (24.7%), "jokes/ridicule" (4.8%), and "personal experiences" (4.3%). The daily average of ageist content was 18%, with the highest of 52.8% on March 11, 2020. Specifically, more than 1 in 10 (11.5%) tweets implied that the life of older adults is less valuable or downplayed the pandemic because it mostly harms older adults. A small proportion (4.6%) explicitly supported the idea of just isolating older adults. Almost three-quarters (72.9%) within "jokes/ridicule" targeted older adults, half of which were "death jokes." Also, 14 themes were extracted, such as perceptions of lockdown and risk. A bi-variate Granger causality test suggested that informative tweets regarding at-risk populations increased the prevalence of tweets that downplayed the pandemic. Discussion: Ageist content in the context of COVID-19 was prevalent on Twitter. Information about COVID-19 on Twitter influenced public perceptions of risk and acceptable ways of controlling the pandemic. Public education on the risk of severe illness is needed to correct misperceptions.

Long simulation times and large length scales are required, demanding years of computing time. Here we present an on-the-fly machine learning scheme that generates force fields automatically during molecular dynamics simulations. This opens up the required time and length scales, while retaining the distinctive chemical precision of first principles methods and minimizing the need for human intervention. The method is widely applicable to multielement complex systems. We demonstrate its predictive power on the entropy driven phase transitions of hybrid perovskites, which have never been accurately described in simulations. Using machine learned potentials, isothermal-isobaric simulations give direct insight into the underlying microscopic mechanisms. Finally, we relate the phase transition temperatures of different perovskites to the radii of the involved species, and we determine the order of the transitions in Landau theory.

Deep Learning in Radiology	ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Machine learning; deep learning; machine intelligence; artificial intelligence	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPEECH RECOGNITION; CHEST RADIOGRAPHY; NODULE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES; CT; SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHM; DISEASE	As radiology is inherently a data-driven specialty, it is especially conducive to utilizing data processing techniques. One such technique, deep learning (DL), has become a remarkably powerful tool for image processing in recent years. In this work, the Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Task Force on Deep Learning provides an overview of DL for the radiologist. This article aims to present an overview of DL in a manner that is understandable to radiologists; to examine past, present, and future applications; as well as to evaluate how radiologists may benefit from this remarkable new tool. We describe several areas within radiology in which DL techniques are having the most significant impact: lesion or disease detection, classification, quantification, and segmentation. The legal and ethical hurdles to implementation are also discussed. By taking advantage of this powerful tool, radiologists can become increasingly more accurate in their interpretations with fewer errors and spend more time to focus on patient care.

Finally, we describe many case studies of discoveries accelerated by or resulting from computer assistance and automation from the domains of synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science. These illustrate how rapid advancements in hardware automation and machine learning continue to transform the nature of experimentation and modeling.

J	Wu, JL; Xiao, H; Paterson, E				Wu, Jin-Long; Xiao, Heng; Paterson, Eric			Physics-informed machine learning approach for augmenting turbulence models: A comprehensive framework	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article							DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; FLOW; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS	Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, RANS predictions may have large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high-fidelity simulations [J.-X. Wang et al., Phys Rev. Fluids 2, 034603 (2017)]. However, solving for mean flows from the improved Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential ill-conditioning of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling improved predictions of mean velocities is of profound practical importance, because often the velocity and its derived quantities (quantities of interest, e.g., drag, lift, and surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for augmenting turbulence models with physics-informed machine learning, illustrating a complete workflow from identification of input features to final prediction of mean velocities .This work has two innovations. First, we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of the proposed framework.

However, such techniques are hindered by subjectivity resulting from inter-and intrarater cognitive variability. This translates to erroneous decisions and a significant waste of resources. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning framework's ability to identify and classify a diverse set of foliar stresses in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] with remarkable accuracy. We also present an explanation mechanism, using the top-K high-resolution feature maps that isolate the visual symptoms used to make predictions. This unsupervised identification of visual symptoms provides a quantitative measure of stress severity, allowing for identification (type of foliar stress), classification (low, medium, or high stress), and quantification (stress severity) in a single framework without detailed symptom annotation by experts. We reliably identified and classified several biotic (bacterial and fungal diseases) and abiotic (chemical injury and nutrient deficiency) stresses by learning from over 25,000 images. The learned model is robust to input image perturbations, demonstrating viability for high-throughput deployment. We also noticed that the learned model appears to be agnostic to species, seemingly demonstrating an ability of transfer learning. The availability of an explainable model that can consistently, rapidly, and accurately identify and quantify foliar stresses would have significant implications in scientific research, plant breeding, and crop production. The trained model could be deployed in mobile platforms (e.g., unmanned air vehicles and automated ground scouts) for rapid, large-scale scouting or as a mobile application for real-time detection of stress by farmers and researchers.

This Progress Report shows how machine learning (ML) is currently enabling a new degree of realism in materials modeling: by "learning" electronic-structure data, ML-based interatomic potentials give access to atomistic simulations that reach similar accuracy levels but are orders of magnitude faster. A brief introduction to the new tools is given, and then, applications to some select problems in materials science are highlighted: phase-change materials for memory devices; nanoparticle catalysts; and carbon-based electrodes for chemical sensing, supercapacitors, and batteries. It is hoped that the present work will inspire the development and wider use of ML-based interatomic potentials in diverse areas of materials research.

Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machine learning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and subdistrict availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.

However, inflammation is not the only process involved in atherogenesis and we hypothesized that additional radiomic signatures of adverse fibrotic and microvascular PVAT remodelling, may further improve cardiac risk prediction. Methods and results We present a new artificial intelligence-powered method to predict cardiac risk by analysing the radiomic profile of coronary PVAT, developed and validated in patient cohorts acquired in three different studies. In Study 1, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from 167 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and the expression of genes representing inflammation, fibrosis and vascularity was linked with the radiomic features extracted from tissue CT images. Adipose tissue wavelet-transformed mean attenuation (captured by FAI) was the most sensitive radiomic feature in describing tissue inflammation (TNFA expression), while features of radiomic texture were related to adipose tissue fibrosis (COL1A1 expression) and vascularity (CD31 expression). In Study 2, we analysed 1391 coronary PVAT radiomic features in 101 patients who experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 5years of having a CCTA and 101 matched controls, training and validating a machine learning (random forest) algorithm (fat radiomic profile, FRP) to discriminate cases from controls (C-statistic 0.77 [95%CI: 0.62-0.93] in the external validation set). The coronary FRP signature was then tested in 1575 consecutive eligible participants in the SCOT-HEART trial, where it significantly improved MACE prediction beyond traditional risk stratification that included risk factors, coronary calcium score, coronary stenosis, and high-risk plaque features on CCTA (Delta[C-statistic] = 0.126, P<0.001). In Study 3, FRP was significantly higher in 44 patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction compared with 44 matched controls, but unlike FAI, remained unchanged 6 months after the index event, confirming that FRP detects persistent PVAT changes not captured by FAI. Conclusion The CCTA-based radiomic profiling of coronary artery PVAT detects perivascular structural remodelling associated with coronary artery disease, beyond inflammation. A new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered imaging biomarker (FRP) leads to a striking improvement of cardiac risk prediction over and above the current state-of-the-art.

J	Petch, J; Di, S; Nelson, W				Petch, Jeremy; Di, Shuang; Nelson, Walter			Opening the Black Box: The Promise and Limitations of Explainable Machine Learning in Cardiology	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Review							RESPONSE SYSTEM; INTERPRETABILITY; EXPLANATIONS; ALGORITHM; HEALTH	Many clinicians remain wary of machine learning because of longstanding concerns about "black box" models. "Black box" is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans. Lack of interpretability in predictive models can undermine trust in those models, especially in health care, in which so many decisions are- literally-life and death issues. There has been a recent explosion of research in the field of explain-able machine learning aimed at addressing these concerns. The promise of explainable machine learning is considerable, but it is important for cardiologists who may encounter these techniques in clinical decision-support tools or novel research papers to have critical understanding of both their strengths and their limitations. This paper reviews key concepts and techniques in the field of explainable machine learning as they apply to cardiology. Key concepts reviewed include interpretability vs explainability and global vs local explanations. Techniques demonstrated include permutation importance, surrogate decision trees, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and partial dependence plots. We discuss several limitations with explainability techniques, focusing on the how the nature of explanations as approximations may omit important information about how black-box models work and why they make certain predictions. We conclude by proposing a rule of thumb about when it is appropriate to use black-box models with explanations rather than interpretable models.

Repurposing drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for another indication is a more rapid and less expensive option. We present DRIAD (Drug Repurposing In AD), a machine learning framework that quantifies potential associations between the pathology of AD severity (the Braak stage) and molecular mechanisms as encoded in lists of gene names. DRIAD is applied to lists of genes arising from perturbations in differentiated human neural cell cultures by 80 FDA-approved and clinically tested drugs, producing a ranked list of possible repurposing candidates. Top-scoring drugs are inspected for common trends among their targets. We propose that the DRIAD method can be used to nominate drugs that, after additional validation and identification of relevant pharmacodynamic biomarker(s), could be readily evaluated in a clinical trial. Clinical trials of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have provided largely negative results, so far. Here, the authors present a machine learning framework that quantifies potential associations between the pathology of AD severity and gene-based molecular mechanisms to enable drug repurposing.

However, the applications of artificial intelligence models can overcome this issue through forecasting and evaluating the irrigation water quality indexes of aquifer systems using physical parameters as features. This paper aims forecasting the Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Potential Salinity (PS), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP), Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), and the Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) parameters through Electrical Conductivity (EC), Temperature (T), and pH as inputs. To achieve this purpose, we developed and evaluated Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models using 520 samples of data related to fourteen Groundwater quality parameters in Berrechid aquifer, Morocco. The results revealed that the overall prediction performances of Adaboost and RF models are higher than those of SVR and ANN. However, the generalization ability and sensitivity to the inputs analyses show that the ANN and SVR models are more generalizable and less sensitive to input variables than Adaboost and RF. Globally, the developed models are valuable in forecasting the irrigation water quality parameters and could help the farmers and decision-makers in managing the irrigation water strategies. The developed approaches in this study have been revealed promising in low-cost and real-time forecast of groundwater quality through the use of physical parameters as input variables.

The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods: Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two sub-datasets (COVID-specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID-19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal-external and external validation. Results: We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID-specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96. Conclusions: ML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients. This is especially useful in developing countries, or in countries facing an increase in contagions.

Therefore, it is essential to develop an advanced approach for fatigue issues. Although some theoretical methods are used for fatigue analysis of AM metal parts, their implementations are time-consuming. Furthermore, these methods cannot directly consider the effects of AM parameters. In this study, a platform is developed for a data-driven analysis of continuum damage mechanics (CDM)-based fatigue life prediction of AM stainless steel (SS) 316L, in which the effects of AM process parameters (including laser power P, scan speed v, hatch space h, powder layer thickness t) are considered. Here, three typical ML models: an artificial neural network (ANN), a random forest (RF), and a support vector machine (SVM), are trained effectively by a database produced by the CDM technique, and then further comparisons are made between the predicted results and published experimental data to verify the proposed platform. Finally, detailed parametric studies using the ML models are conducted to investigate some of the significant characteristics.

Here, we demonstrate a two-step machine learning approach to guide experiments in search of xBi[Me'Me-y ''((1-y))]O-3-(1 - x) PbTiO3-based perovskites with high ferroelectric Curie temperature. These involve classification learning to screen for compositions in the perovskite structures, and regression coupled to active learning to identify promising perovskites for synthesis and feedback. The problem is challenging because the search space is vast, spanning similar to 61,500 compositions and only 167 are experimentally studied. Furthermore, not every composition can be synthesized in the perovskite phase. In this work, we predict x, y, Me', and Me '' such that the resulting compositions have both high Curie temperature and form in the perovskite structure. Outcomes from both successful and failed experiments then iteratively refine the machine learning models via an active learning loop. Our approach finds six perovskites out of ten compositions synthesized, including three previously unexplored {Me'Me ''} pairs, with 0.2Bi (Fe0.12Co0.88)O-3-0.8PbTiO(3) showing the highest measured Curie temperature of 898 K among them.

This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.

Mahammad			Real-Time Twitter Spam Detection and Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FRAMEWORK; ACCOUNTS	In this modern world, we are accustomed to a constant stream of data. Major social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or Quora face a huge dilemma as a lot of these sites fall victim to spam accounts. These accounts are made to trap unsuspecting genuine users by making them click on malicious links or keep posting redundant posts by using bots. This can greatly impact the experiences that users have on these sites. A lot of time and research has gone into effective ways to detect these forms of spam. Performing sentiment analysis on these posts can help us in solving this problem effectively. The main purpose of this proposed work is to develop a system that can determine whether a tweet is "spam" or "ham" and evaluate the emotion of the tweet. The extracted features after preprocessing the tweets are classified using various classifiers, namely, decision tree, logistic regression, multinomial naive Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and Bernoulli naive Bayes for spam detection. The stochastic gradient descent, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, and deep learning methods, namely, simple recurrent neural network (RNN) model, long short-term memory (LSTM) model, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model, and 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) model are used for sentiment analysis. The performance of each classifier is analyzed. The classification results showed that the features extracted from the tweets can be satisfactorily used to identify if a certain tweet is spam or not and create a learning model that will associate tweets with a particular sentiment.

J	Jia, F; Lei, YG; Guo, L; Lin, J; Xing, SB				Jia, Feng; Lei, Yaguo; Guo, Liang; Lin, Jing; Xing, Saibo			A neural network constructed by deep learning technique and its application to intelligent fault diagnosis of machines	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Normalized sparse autoencoder; Deep learning; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Local connection network	ROTATING MACHINERY; PARAMETERS; FEATURES	In traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods of machines, plenty of actual effort is taken for the manual design of fault features, which makes these methods less automatic. Among deep learning techniques, autoencoders may be a potential tool for automatic feature extraction of mechanical signals. However, traditional autoencoders have two following shortcomings. (1) They may learn similar features in mechanical feature extraction. (2) The learned features have shift variant properties, which leads to the misclassification of mechanical health conditions. To overcome the aforementioned shortcomings, a local connection network (LCN) constructed by normalized sparse autoencoder (NSAE), namely NSAE-LCN, is proposed for intelligent fault diagnosis. We construct LCN by input layer, local layer, feature layer and output layer. When raw vibration signals are fed to the input layer, LCN first uses NSAE to locally learn various meaningful features from input signals in the local layer, then obtains shift-invariant features in the feature layer and finally recognizes mechanical health conditions in the output layer. Thus, NSAE-LCN incorporates feature extraction and fault recognition into a general-purpose learning procedure. A gearbox dataset and a bearing dataset are used to validate the performance of the proposed NSAE-LCN. The results indicate that the learned features of NSAE are meaningful and dissimilar, and LCN helps to produce shift-invariant features and recognizes mechanical health conditions effectively. Through comparing with commonly used diagnosis methods, the superiority of the proposed NSAE-LCN is verified. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As storage, high-end servers, and network devices, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is designed to replace purpose-built network elements with VNFs (Virtualized Network Functions). A Software Defined Network Function Virtualization (SDNFV) network is designed in this paper to boost network performance. Stateful firewall services are deployed as VNFs in the SDN network in this article to offer security and boost network scalability. The SDN controller's role is to develop a set of guidelines and rules to avoid hazardous network connectivity. Intruder assaults that employ numerous socket addresses cannot be adequately protected by these strategies. Machine learning algorithms are trained using traditional network threat intelligence data to identify potentially malicious linkages and probable attack targets. Based on conventional network data (DT), Bayesian Network (BayesNet), Naive-Bayes, C4.5, and Decision Table (DT) algorithms are used to predict the target host that will be attacked. The experimental results shows that the Bayesian Network algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 92.87%, Native-Bayes Algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 87.81%, C4.5 Algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 84.92%, and the Decision Tree algorithm achieved an average prediction accuracy of 83.18%.

Besides classic control design approaches, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods are present in almost all of these fields. Another part of research focuses on different layers of Motion Planning, such as strategic decisions, trajectory planning, and control. A wide range of techniques in Machine Learning itself have been developed, and this article describes one of these fields, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The paper provides insight into the hierarchical motion planning problem and describes the basics of DRL. The main elements of designing such a system are the modeling of the environment, the modeling abstractions, the description of the state and the perception models, the appropriate rewarding, and the realization of the underlying neural network. The paper describes vehicle models, simulation possibilities and computational requirements. Strategic decisions on different layers and the observation models, e.g., continuous and discrete state representations, grid-based, and camera-based solutions are presented. The paper surveys the state-of-art solutions systematized by the different tasks and levels of autonomous driving, such as car-following, lane-keeping, trajectory following, merging, or driving in dense traffic. Finally, open questions and future challenges are discussed.

However, this is a challenging task due to the intermittent and chaotic nature of renewable energy data. To date, various methods have been developed, including physical models, statistical methods, artificial intelligence techniques, and their hybrids to improve the forecasting accuracy of renewable energy. Among them, deep learning, as a promising type of machine learning capable for discovering the inherent nonlinear features and high-level invariant structures in data, has been frequently reported in the literature. This paper provides a comprehensive and extensive review of renewable energy forecasting methods based on deep learning to explore its effectiveness, efficiency and application potential. We divide the existing deterministic and probabilistic forecasting methods based on deep learning into four groups, namely deep belief network, stack auto-encoder, deep recurrent neural network and others. We also dissect the feasible data preprocessing techniques and error post-correction methods to improve the forecasting accuracy. Extensive analysis and discussion of various deep learning based forecasting methods are given. Finally, we explore the current research activities, challenges and potential future research directions in this topic.

Here, we present iLearn, a comprehensive and versatile Python-based toolkit, integrating the functionality of feature extraction, clustering, normalization, selection, dimensionality reduction, predictor construction, best descriptor/model selection, ensemble learning and results visualization for DNA, RNA and protein sequences. iLearn was designed for users that only want to upload their data set and select the functions they need calculated from it, while all necessary procedures and optimal settings are completed automatically by the software. iLearn includes a variety of descriptors for DNA, RNA and proteins, and four feature output formats are supported so as to facilitate direct output usage or communication with other computational tools. In total, iLearn encompasses 16 different types of feature clustering, selection, normalization and dimensionality reduction algorithms, and five commonly used machine-learning algorithms, thereby greatly facilitating feature analysis and predictor construction. iLearn is made freely available via an online web server and a stand-alone toolkit.

Electronic skins and machine learning for intelligent soft robots	SCIENCE ROBOTICS			English	Review							ARTIFICIAL SKIN; STRAIN SENSORS; SPATIAL ACUITY; HUMAN HAND; TACTILE; FABRICATION; DESIGN; SHAPE; RECOGNITION; SURFACES	Soft robots have garnered interest for real-world applications because of their intrinsic safety embedded at the material level. These robots use deformable materials capable of shape and behavioral changes and allow conformable physical contact for manipulation. Yet, with the introduction of soft and stretchable materials to robotic systems comes a myriad of challenges for sensor integration, including multimodal sensing capable of stretching, embedment of high-resolution but large-area sensor arrays, and sensor fusion with an increasing volume of data. This Review explores the emerging confluence of e-skins and machine learning, with a focus on how roboticists can combine recent developments from the two fields to build autonomous, deployable soft robots, integrated with capabilities for informative touch and proprioception to stand up to the challenges of real-world environments.

However, the knowledge libraries or deep networks for most recent lifelong learning models are of prescribed size and can degenerate the performance for both learned tasks and coming ones when facing with a new task environment (cluster). To address this challenge, we propose a novel incremental clustered lifelong learning framework with two knowledge libraries: feature learning library and model knowledge library, called Flexible Clustered Lifelong Learning (FCL3). Specifically, the feature learning library modeled by an autoencoder architecture maintains a set of representation common across all the observed tasks, and the model knowledge library can be self-selected by identifying and adding new representative models (clusters). When a new task arrives, our FCL3 model firstly transfers knowledge from these libraries to encode the new task, i.e., effectively and selectively soft-assigning this new task to multiple representative models over feature learning library. Then: 1) the new task with a higher outlier probability will be judged as a new representative, and used to redefine both feature learning library and representative models over time; or 2) the new task with lower outlier probability will only refine the feature learning library. For model optimization, we cast this lifelong learning problem as an alternating direction minimization problem as a new task comes. Finally, we evaluate the proposed framework by analyzing several multitask data sets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our FCL3 model can achieve better performance than most lifelong learning frameworks, even batch clustered multitask learning models.

The accuracy of cancer prognosis prediction will greatly benefit clinical management of cancer patients. The improvement of biomedical translational research and the application of advanced statistical analysis and machine learning methods are the driving forces to improve cancer prognosis prediction. Recent years, there is a significant increase of computational power and rapid advancement in the technology of artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning. In addition, the cost reduction in large scale next-generation sequencing, and the availability of such data through open source databases (e.g., TCGA and GEO databases) o ffer us opportunities to possibly build more powerful and accurate models to predict cancer prognosis more accurately. In this review, we reviewed the most recent published works that used deep learning to build models for cancer prognosis prediction. Deep learning has been suggested to be a more generic model, requires less data engineering, and achieves more accurate prediction when working with large amounts of data. The application of deep learning in cancer prognosis has been shown to be equivalent or better than current approaches, such as Cox-PH. With the burst of multi-omics data, including genomics data, transcriptomics data and clinical information in cancer studies, we believe that deep learning would potentially improve cancer prognosis.

Concept drift research involves the development of methodologies and techniques for drift detection, understanding, and adaptation. Data analysis has revealed that machine learning in a concept drift environment will result in poor learning results if the drift is not addressed. To help researchers identify which research topics are significant and how to apply related techniques in data analysis tasks, it is necessary that a high quality, instructive review of current research developments and trends in the concept drift field is conducted. In addition, due to the rapid development of concept drift in recent years, the methodologies of learning under concept drift have become noticeably systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in literature. This paper reviews over 130 high quality publications in concept drift related research areas, analyzes up-to-date developments in methodologies and techniques, and establishes a framework of learning under concept drift including three main components: concept drift detection, concept drift understanding, and concept drift adaptation. This paper lists and discusses 10 popular synthetic datasets and 14 publicly available benchmark datasets used for evaluating the performance of learning algorithms aiming at handling concept drift. Also, concept drift related research directions are covered and discussed. By providing state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers in their understanding of research developments in the field of learning under concept drift.

Generative Deep Neural Networks for Inverse Materials Design Using Backpropagation and Active Learning	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						composites; inverse problem; machine learning; materials design; optimization algorithms	MACHINE; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATICS; MODELS; GENE	In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques are seen to be promising tools to discover and design novel materials. However, the lack of robust inverse design approaches to identify promising candidate materials without exploring the entire design space causes a fundamental bottleneck. A general-purpose inverse design approach is presented using generative inverse design networks. This ML-based inverse design approach uses backpropagation to calculate the analytical gradients of an objective function with respect to design variables. This inverse design approach is capable of overcoming local minima traps by using backpropagation to provide rapid calculations of gradient information and running millions of optimizations with different initial values. Furthermore, an active learning strategy is adopted in the inverse design approach to improve the performance of candidate materials and reduce the amount of training data needed to do so. Compared to passive learning, the active learning strategy is capable of generating better designs and reducing the amount of training data by at least an order-of-magnitude in the case study on composite materials. The inverse design approach is compared with conventional gradient-based topology optimization and gradient-free genetic algorithms and the pros and cons of each method are discussed when applied to materials discovery and design problems.

In this study, we demonstrate that a neural network can learn to perform phase recovery and holographic image reconstruction after appropriate training. This deep learning-based approach provides an entirely new framework to conduct holographic imaging by rapidly eliminating twin-image and self-interference-related spatial artifacts. This neural network-based method is fast to compute and reconstructs phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, requiring fewer measurements in addition to being computationally faster. We validated this method by reconstructing the phase and amplitude images of various samples, including blood and Pap smears and tissue sections. These results highlight that challenging problems in imaging science can be overcome through machine learning, providing new avenues to design powerful computational imaging systems.

J	Kunzel, SR; Sekhon, JS; Bickel, PJ; Yu, B				Kunzel, Soren R.; Sekhon, Jasjeet S.; Bickel, Peter J.; Yu, Bin			Metalearners for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using machine learning	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						observational studies; randomized controlled trials; conditional average treatment effect; heterogeneous treatment effects; minimax optimality	FIELD EXPERIMENT; SOCIAL PRESSURE	There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms-such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks-to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.

Machine learning for data-driven discovery in solid Earth geoscience	SCIENCE			English	Review							SEISMIC EVENT CLASSIFICATION; DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; AUTOMATIC DISCRIMINATION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; AIRBORNE GEOPHYSICS; INVERSE PROBLEMS; FACIES ANALYSIS; RANDOM FORESTS	Understanding the behavior of Earth through the diverse fields of the solid Earth geosciences is an increasingly important task. It is made challenging by the complex, interacting, and multiscale processes needed to understand Earth's behavior and by the inaccessibility of nearly all of Earth's subsurface to direct observation. Substantial increases in data availability and in the increasingly realistic character of computer simulations hold promise for accelerating progress, but developing a deeper understanding based on these capabilities is itself challenging. Machine learning will play a key role in this effort. We review the state of the field and make recommendations for how progress might be broadened and accelerated.

Materials and Methods: This institutional review board-approved prospective study included 38 women (median age, 46.5 years; range, 25-70 years) with breast cancer who were scheduled for NAC and underwent mpMRI of the breast at 3 T with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and T2-weighted imaging before and after 2 cycles of NAC. For each lesion, 23 features were extracted: qualitative T2-weighted and DCE-MRI features according to BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System), quantitative pharmacokinetic DCE features (mean plasma flow, volume distribution, mean transit time), and DWI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. To apply machine learning to mpMRI, 8 classifiers including linear support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, random forests, stochastic gradient descent, decision tree, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to rank the features. Histopathologic residual cancer burden (RCB) class (with RCB 0 being a pCR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were used as the standards of reference. Classification accuracy with area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) was assessed using all the extracted qualitative and quantitative features for pCR as defined by RCB class, RFS, and DSS using recursive feature elimination. To overcome overfitting, 4-fold cross-validation was used. Results: Machine learning with mpMRI achieved stable performance as shown by mean classification accuracies for the prediction of RCB class (AUC, 0.86) and DSS (AUC, 0.92) based on XGBoost and the prediction of RFS (AUC, 0.83) with logistic regression. The XGBoost classifier achieved the most stable performance with high accuracies compared with other classifiers. The most relevant features for the prediction of RCB class were as follows: changes in lesion size, complete pattern of shrinkage, and mean transit time on DCE-MRI; minimum ADC on DWI; and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted imaging. The most relevant features for prediction of RFS were as follows: volume distribution, mean plasma flow, andmean transit time; DCE-MRI lesion size; minimum, maximum, and mean ADC with DWI. The most relevant features for prediction of DSS were as follows: lesion size, volume distribution, and mean plasma flow on DCE-MRI, and maximum ADC with DWI. Conclusions: Machine learning with mpMRI of the breast enables early prediction of pCR to NAC as well as survival outcomes in breast cancer patients with high accuracy and thus may provide valuable predictive information to guide treatment decisions.

The GDPR is designed to give users more control over their personal data, which motivates us to explore machine learning frameworks for data sharing that do not violate user privacy. To meet this goal, in this article, we propose a novel lossless privacy-preserving tree-boosting system known as SecureBoost in the setting of federated learning. SecureBoost first conducts entity alignment under a privacy-preserving protocol and then constructs boosting trees across multiple parties with a carefully designed encryption strategy. This federated learning system allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over multiple parties with common user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds to a vertically partitioned dataset. An advantage of SecureBoost is that it provides the same level of accuracy as the non -privacy-preserving approach while at the same time, reveals no information of each private data provider. We show that the SecureBoost framework is as accurate as other nonfederated gradient tree-boosting algorithms that require centralized data, and thus, it is highly scalable and practical for industrial applications such as credit risk analysis. To this end, we discuss information leakage during the protocol execution and propose ways to provably reduce it.

Here, we provide novel stemness indices for assessing the degree of oncogenic dedifferentiation. We used an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm to extract transcriptomic and epigenetic feature sets derived from non-transformed pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny. Using OCLR, we were able to identify previously undiscovered biological mechanisms associated with the dedifferentiated oncogenic state. Analyses of the tumor microenvironment revealed unanticipated correlation of cancer stemness with immune checkpoint expression and infiltrating immune cells. We found that the dedifferentiated oncogenic phenotype was generally most prominent in metastatic tumors. Application of our stemness indices to single-cell data revealed patterns of intra-tumor molecular heterogeneity. Finally, the indices allowed for the identification of novel targets and possible targeted therapies aimed at tumor differentiation.

Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial-and-error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. In current study, the effect of sp(2)-hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end-capping has significantly decreased the electron-reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron-mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB-T polymer donor. Florgy-Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB-T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB-T has a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end-capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.

Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.

An Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Accurate Prediction of Sepsis in the ICU	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						informatics; machine learning; organ failure; prognostication; sepsis	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; EPIDEMIOLOGY; STATES	Objectives: Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost overruns in critically ill patients. Early intervention with antibiotics improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015. Patients: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: High-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation cohorts was indistinguishable. Conclusions: Using data available in the ICU in real-time, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in an ICU patient 4-12 hours prior to clinical recognition. A prospective study is necessary to determine the clinical utility of the proposed sepsis prediction model.

In this regard, a 15-layered convolutional neural network architecture is developed which extracts deep features from the selected image samples ? collected from the Radiopeadia. Deep features are collected from two different layers, global average pool and fully connected layers, which are later combined using the max-layer detail (MLD) approach. Subsequently, a Correntropy technique is embedded in the main design to select the most discriminant features from the pool of features. One-class kernel extreme learning machine classifier is utilized for the final classification to achieving an average accuracy of 95.1%, and the sensitivity, specificity & precision rate of 95.1%, 95%, & 94% respectively. To further verify our claims, detailed statistical analyses based on standard error mean (SEM) is also provided, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed prediction design.

Prior knowledge embedded in the physics computation itself rarely draws attention. We show that solving the Kohn-Sham equations when training neural networks for the exchange-correlation functional provides an implicit regularization that greatly improves generalization. Two separations suffice for learning the entire one-dimensional H-2 dissociation curve within chemical accuracy, including the strongly correlated region. Our models also generalize to unseen types of molecules and overcome self-interaction error.

Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a set of tools that can improve discovery and decision making for well-specified questions with abundant, high-quality data. Opportunities to apply ML occur in all stages of drug discovery. Examples include target validation, identification of prognostic biomarkers and analysis of digital pathology data in clinical trials. Applications have ranged in context and methodology, with some approaches yielding accurate predictions and insights. The challenges of applying ML lie primarily with the lack of interpretability and repeatability of ML-generated results, which may limit their application. In all areas, systematic and comprehensive high-dimensional data still need to be generated. With ongoing efforts to tackle these issues, as well as increasing awareness of the factors needed to validate ML approaches, the application of ML can promote data-driven decision making and has the potential to speed up the process and reduce failure rates in drug discovery and development.

Stable machine-learning parameterization of subgrid processes for climate modeling at a range of resolutions	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CONVECTION; CIRCULATION; SENSITIVITY	Global climate models represent small-scale processes such as convection using subgrid models known as parameterizations, and these parameterizations contribute substantially to uncertainty in climate projections. Machine learning of new parameterizations from high-resolution model output is a promising approach, but such parameterizations have been prone to issues of instability and climate drift, and their performance for different grid spacings has not yet been investigated. Here we use a random forest to learn a parameterization from coarse-grained output of a three-dimensional high-resolution idealized atmospheric model. The parameterization leads to stable simulations at coarse resolution that replicate the climate of the high-resolution simulation. Retraining for different coarse-graining factors shows the parameterization performs best at smaller horizontal grid spacings. Our results yield insights into parameterization performance across length scales, and they also demonstrate the potential for learning parameterizations from global high-resolution simulations that are now emerging. Machine learning has been used to represent small-scale processes, such as clouds, in atmospheric models but this can lead to instability in simulations of climate. Here, the authors demonstrate a use of machine learning in an atmospheric model that leads to stable simulations of climate at a range of grid spacings.

In this approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation. Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power, neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking neurons' transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many fewer operations and are the better candidates to process spatio-temporal data.

In the smart cities concept, ICT is playing a vital role in policy design, decision, implementation, and ultimate productive services. The primary objective of this review is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the evolution of smart cities. The preceding techniques are efficiently used to design optimal policy regarding various smart city-oriented complex problems. In this survey, we present in-depth details of the applications of the prior techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), cyber-security, energy-efficient utilization of smart grids (SGs), effective use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assure the best services of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communications, and smart health care system in a smart city. Finally, we present various research challenges and future research directions where the aforementioned techniques can play an outstanding role to realize the concept of a smart city.

The resulting features can be used to inform imaging diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response in oncology. However, major challenges remain for methodologic developments to optimize feature extraction and provide rapid information flow in clinical settings. Equally important, to be clinically useful, predictive radiomic properties must be clearly linked to meaningful biologic characteristics and qualitative imaging properties familiar to radiologists. Here we use a cross-disciplinary approach to highlight studies in radiomics. We review brain tumor radiologic studies (eg, imaging interpretation) through computational models (eg, computer vision and machine learning) that provide novel clinical insights. We outline current quantitative image feature extraction and prediction strategies with different levels of available clinical classes for supporting clinical decision-making.

J	Choudhary, A; Goyal, D; Letha, SS				Choudhary, Anurag; Goyal, Deepam; Letha, Shimi Sudha			Infrared Thermography-Based Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motor Bearings Using Machine Learning	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Feature extraction; Induction motors; Fault diagnosis; Support vector machines; Sensors; Principal component analysis; Fault detection; Bearings; fault diagnosis; induction motor; infrared thermography; principal component analysis; support vector machines	DECISION TREE; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; GEAR	Bearing is one of the most crucial parts in induction motor (IM) as a result there is a constant call for effective diagnosis of bearing faults for reliable operation. Infrared thermography (IRT) is appreciably used as a non-destructive and non-contact method to detect the bearing defects in a rotary machine. However, its performance is limited by insignificant information and string noise present in the infrared thermal image. To address this issue, an emergent two dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) based IRT method has been proposed in this article for diagnosing the different bearing faults in IM, namely, inner and outer race defects, and lack of lubrication. The dimensionality of the extracted features was reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) and thereafter the selected features were ranked in the order of most relevant features using the Mahalanobis distance (MD) method to achieve the optimal feature set. Finally these selected features have been passed to the complex decision tree (CDT), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) for fault classification and performance evaluation. The classification results reveal that the SVM outperformed CDT and LDA. The proposed strategy can be used for self-adaptive recognition of bearing faults in IM which helps to avoid the unplanned and unwanted system shutdowns due to the bearing failure.

Although large amounts of interests have been paid in the house price modeling, limited work has focused on evaluating the price appreciation rate. In this study, we propose a data-fusion framework to examine how well house price appreciation potentials can be predicted by combining multiple data sources. We used data sets including house structural attributes, house photos, locational amenities, street view images, transportation accessibility, visitor patterns, and socioeconomic attributes of neighborhoods to enrich our understanding of the real estate appreciation and its predictive modeling. As a case study, we investigate more than 20,000 houses in the Greater Boston Area, and discuss the spatial dependency of house price appreciations, influential variables and their relationships. In detail, we extract deep features from street view images and house photos using a deep learning model, merging features from multi-source data and modeling house price appreciation using machine learning models and the geographically weighted regression at two spatial scales: fine-scale point level and aggregated neighborhood level. Results show that the house price appreciation rate can be modeled with high accuracy using the proposed framework (R-2 = 0.74 for gradient boosting machine at neighborhood-scale). We discovered that houses with low house prices and small house areas may have a higher house appreciation potential. Our results provide insights into how multi-source big geo-data can be employed in machine learning frameworks to characterize real estate price trends and help understand human settlements for policy-making.

Deep Learning in Alzheimer's Disease: Diagnostic Classification and Prognostic Prediction Using Neuroimaging Data	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						artificial intelligence; machine learning; deep learning; classification; Alzheimer's disease; neuroimaging; magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography	NEURAL-NETWORKS; FEATURE REPRESENTATION; MODEL; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM	Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as-omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.

J	Zhang, JL; Qu, G				Zhang, Jiliang; Qu, Gang			Physical Unclonable Function-Based Key Sharing via Machine Learning for IoT Security	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Key-sharing; machine learning (ML); physical unclonable function (PUF)	PUF; IMPLEMENTATION; DESIGN	In many industry Internet of Things applications, resources like CPU, memory, and battery power are limited and cannot afford the classic cryptographic security solutions. Silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) is a lightweight security primitive that exploits manufacturing variations during the chip fabrication process for key generation and/or device authentication. However, traditional weak PUFs such as ring oscillator (RO) PUF generate chip-unique key for each device, which restricts their application in security protocols where the same key is required to be shared in resource-constrained devices. In this article, in order to address this issue, we propose a PUF-based key sharing method for the first time. The basic idea is to implement one-to-one input-output mapping with lookup table (LUT)-based interstage crossing structures in each level of inverters of RO PUF. Individual customization on configuration bits of interstage crossing structure and different RO selections with challenges bring high flexibility. Therefore, with the flexible configuration of interstage crossing structures and challenges, crossover RO PUF can generate the same shared key for resource-constrained devices, which enables a new application for lightweight key sharing protocols.

J	Bakay, MS; Agbulut, U				Bakay, Melahat Sevgul; Agbulut, Umit			Electricity production based forecasting of greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey with deep learning, support vector machine and artificial neural network algorithms	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						CO2 emission; Electricity production; GHG; Greenhouse gases; Machine learning algorithm	GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; CO2 EMISSIONS; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; GHG EMISSIONS; PREDICTION; PERFORMANCE; MODELS; REGIONS; GENERATION	Today, the world's primary energy demand has been met by the burning of fossil-based fuels at a rate of 85%. This dominant use of fossil-based fuels has led to an accelerating increase in the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) all across the world. The largest share in total GHG emissions belongs to the electricity and heat production sector with a rate of 25%. With this viewpoint, this paper is aiming to forecast the GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, F-gases, and total GHG) using deep learning (DL), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms from the electricity production sector in Turkey. The dataset is supplied from the Turkish Statistical Institute and covers the years 1990-2018. In the study, the last four years (2015-2018) is being forecasted. To evaluate the performance success of the algorithms, five metrics (RMSE, MBE, rRMSE, R-2, and MAPE) are discussed in detail. In the results, this research is reporting that all algorithms used in the study are giving separately satisfying results for the forecasting of GHG emissions in Turkey. Based on the forecasting results, it is seen that the highest R-2 value for the emissions varies from 0.861 to 0.998 and all results are categorized as "excellent" in terms of rRMSE (all rRMSE values < 10%). Besides, MBE changes between -2.427 and 2.235, and all MAPE values are smaller than 1.2%. Total GHG emission is forecasted in DL algorithm with very satisfied R-2, RMSE, MBE, rRMSE, and MAPE of 0.998, 2.046, 0.419, 0.406%, and 0.021%, respectively. On the other hand, CO2 accounted for 69.05% of total GHG emissions of Turkey in 1990 but rising by 80.48% in the year 2018. In comparison with those of 1990, electricity production and total GHG emissions of Turkey in 2018 increased by 429.7% and 137.4%, respectively. Total GHG emission corresponding to electricity production is calculated to be 0.3813 Mt-total GHG/MWh in 1990 and 0.1709 Mt-total GHG/MWh in 2018. In conclusion, GHG emissions have recently increased at a high rate, but it is noticed that this increase is considerably higher as compared to the increase in energy production for Turkey.

J	Qi, CC; Chen, QS; Kim, SS				Qi, Chongchong; Chen, Qiusong; Kim, S. Sonny			Integrated and intelligent design framework for cemented paste backfill: A combination of robust machine learning modelling and multi-objective optimization	MINERALS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cemented paste backfill; Integrated and intelligent design framework; Machine learning modelling; Multi-objective optimization	TAILINGS; STRENGTH; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; BEHAVIOR	Modern mining industry thrives for energy-efficient, clean and sustainable mining processes. The cemented paste backfill (CPB) technology, which may constitute 25-30% of the total mining cost, is no exception. One of the major bottlenecks for the current CPB design is that different steps were considered separately. No integrated design frameworks have been proposed, hindering the selection of the optimal CPB processing parameters. Towards this end, this study introduces an integrated and intelligent design framework for CPB (IIDF_CPB). The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed IIDF_CPB rely on two important parts. For one thing, robust machine learning (ML) modelling from constituent materials/processing parameters to performance indicators is established. Accurate ML modelling can save lots of time and substantially reduce the number of lab experiments. For another, IIDF_CPB is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem where two or more objectives need to be optimized simultaneously. The methodology of IIDF_CPB is presented and its feasibility is validated using a comprehensive case study. In the case study, ML modelling is conducted using a hybrid method that combines gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to maximize two conflicting performance indicators, namely slump and unconfined compressive strength at 28 days (28-UCS). The case study shows that the GBRT-PSO is robust in the slump and 28-UCS predictions. The average correlation coefficient between experimental and predicted outputs is 0.970 for slump and 0.991 for UCS. NSGA-II is effective in the concurrent optimization of slump and 28-UCS, which determines the Pareto front and maintains the diversity of non-dominated points.

A total of 249 landslide sites have been identified to date and were used in this study to model and validate the LSMs of the study region. Of the 249 landslide locations, 70% were used as training data and 30% for the validation of the resulting LSMs. Sixteen factors related to topographical, hydrological, soil type, geological and environmental conditions were used and a multi-collinearity test of the landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) was performed. Using the natural break method (NBM) in a geographic information system (GIS), the LSMs generated by the RF, FLDA, and ADTree models were categorized into five classes, namely very low, low, medium, high and very high landslide susceptibility (LS) zones. The very high susceptibility zones cover 15.37% (ADTree), 16.10% (FLDA) and 11.36% (RF) of the total catchment area. The results of the different models (FLDA, RF, and ADTree) were explained and compared using the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI), efficiency and true skill statistic (TSS). The accuracy of models was calculated considering both the training and validation data. The results revealed that the AUROC success rates are 0.89 (ADTree), 0.92 (FLDA) and 0.97 (RF) and predication rates are 0.82 (ADTree), 0.79 (FLDA) and 0.98 (RF), which justifies the approach and indicates a reasonably good landslide prediction. The results of the SCAI, efficiency and TSS methods showed that all models have an excellent modeling capability. In a comparison of the models, the RF model outperforms the boosted regression tree (BRT) and ADTree models. The results of the landslide susceptibility modeling could be useful for land-use planning and decision-makers, for managing and controlling the current and future landslides, as well as for the protection of society and the ecosystem.

Social media is increasingly used to share news and opinions about it. A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach.

J	Duraisamy, K				Duraisamy, Karthik			Perspectives on machine learning-augmented Reynolds-averaged and large eddy simulation models of turbulence	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS			English	Article							DATA-DRIVEN; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; DECONVOLUTION; EQUATIONS; SYSTEMS; FLOWS	This work presents a review and perspectives on recent developments in the use of machine learning (ML) to augment Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) models of turbulent flows. Different approaches of applying supervised learning to represent unclosed terms, model discrepancies, and subfilter scales are discussed in the context of RANS and LES modeling. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of the training procedure on the consistency of ML augmentations with the underlying physical model. Techniques to promote model-consistent training, and to avoid the requirement of full fields of direct numerical simulation data are detailed. This is followed by a discussion of physics-informed and mathematical considerations on the choice of the feature space, and imposition of constraints on the ML model. With a view towards developing generalizable ML-augmented RANS and LES models, outstanding challenges are discussed, and perspectives are provided. While the promise of ML-augmented turbulence modeling is clear, and successes have been demonstrated in isolated scenarios, a general consensus of this paper is that truly generalizable models require model-consistent training with careful characterization of underlying assumptions and imposition of physically and mathematically informed priors and constraints to account for the inevitable shortage of data relevant to predictions of interest. Thus, machine learning should be viewed as one tool in the turbulence modeler's toolkit. This modeling endeavor requires multidisciplinary advances, and thus the target audience for this paper is the fluid mechanics community, as well as the computational science and machine learning communities.

Machine learning-aided engineering of hydrolases for PET depolymerization	NATURE			English	Article							PLASTICS	Plastic waste poses an ecological challenge(1-3) and enzymatic degradation offers one, potentiallygreen and scalable, route for polyesters waste recycling(4). Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) accounts for 12% of global solid waste(5), and a circular carbon economy for PET istheoretically attainable through rapid enzymatic depolymerization followed by repolymerization or conversion/valorization into other products(6-10). Application of PET hydrolases, however, has been hampered by their lack of robustness to pH and temperature ranges, slow reaction rates and inability to directly use untreated postconsumer plastics(11). Here, we use a structure-based, machine learning algorithm to engineer a robust and active PET hydrolase. Our mutant and scaffold combination (FAST-PETase: functional, active, stable and tolerant PETase) contains five mutations compared to wild-type PETase (N233K/R224Q/S121E from prediction and D186H/R280A from scaffold) and shows superior PET-hydrolytic activity relative to both wild-type and engineered alternatives(12) between 30 and 50 degrees C and a range of pH levels. We demonstrate that untreated, postconsumer-PET from 51 different thermoformed products can all be almost completely degraded by FAST-PETase in 1 week. FAST-PETase can also depolymerize untreated, amorphous portions of a commercial water bottle and an entire thermally pretreated water bottle at 50 degrees C. Finally, we demonstrate a closed-loop PET recycling process by using FAST-PETase and resynthesizing PET from the recovered monomers. Collectively, our results demonstrate a viable route for enzymatic plastic recycling at the industrial scale.

The prediction is not straightforward due to the uncertain geological conditions and the complex rock-machine interactions. Based on the big data obtained from the 72.1 km long tunnel in the Yin-Song Diversion Project in China, this study developed a machine learning model to predict the TBM performance in a real-time manner. The total thrust and the cutterhead torque during a stable period in a boring cycle was predicted in advance by using the machine-returned parameters in the rising period. A long short-term memory model was developed and its accuracy was evaluated. The results show that the variation in the total thrust and cutterhead torque with various geological conditions can be well reflected by the proposed model. This real-time predication shows superior performance than the classical theoretical model in which only a single value can be obtained based on the single measurement of the rock properties. To improve the accuracy of the model a filtering process was proposed. Results indicate that filtering the unnecessary parameters can enhance both the accuracy and the computational efficiency. Finally, the data deficiency was discussed by assuming a parameter was missing. It is found that the missing of a key parameter can significantly reduce the accuracy of the model, while the supplement of a parameter that highly-correlated with the missing one can improve the prediction.

A wearable biosensing system with in-sensor adaptive machine learning for hand gesture recognition	NATURE ELECTRONICS			English	Article							PATTERN-RECOGNITION; REAL-TIME; ADAPTATION; WIRELESS; STRATEGY; ROBUST	Wearable devices that monitor muscle activity based on surface electromyography could be of use in the development of hand gesture recognition applications. Such devices typically use machine-learning models, either locally or externally, for gesture classification. However, most devices with local processing cannot offer training and updating of the machine-learning model during use, resulting in suboptimal performance under practical conditions. Here we report a wearable surface electromyography biosensing system that is based on a screen-printed, conformal electrode array and has in-sensor adaptive learning capabilities. Our system implements a neuro-inspired hyperdimensional computing algorithm locally for real-time gesture classification, as well as model training and updating under variable conditions such as different arm positions and sensor replacement. The system can classify 13 hand gestures with 97.12% accuracy for two participants when training with a single trial per gesture. A high accuracy (92.87%) is preserved on expanding to 21 gestures, and accuracy is recovered by 9.5% by implementing model updates in response to varying conditions, without additional computation on an external device. A surface electromyography biosensing system that is based on a screen-printed, conformal electrode array and has in-sensor adaptive learning capabilities can classify human gestures in real time and with high accuracy.

Pavement service quality and service life are of great importance for civil engineers as they directly affect the regular service for the users. Therefore, monitoring the health status of pavement before irreversible damage occurs is essential for timely maintenance, which in turn ensures public transportation safety. Many pavement damages can be detected and analyzed by monitoring the structure dynamic responses and evaluating road surface conditions. Advanced technologies can be employed for the collection and analysis of such data, including various intrusive sensing techniques, image processing techniques, and machine learning methods.

For this aim, a database of 538 soil samples collected from the Long Phu 1 power plant project, Vietnam, was utilized to generate the datasets for the modeling process. Different ratios (i.e., 10/90, 20/80, 30/70, 40/60, 50/50, 60/40, 70/30, 80/20, and 90/10) were used to divide the datasets into the training and testing datasets for the performance assessment of models. Popular statistical indicators, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Correlation Coefficient (R), were employed to evaluate the predictive capability of the models under different training and testing ratios. Besides, Monte Carlo simulation was simultaneously carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed models, taking into account the random sampling effect. The results showed that although all three ML models performed well, the ANN was the most accurate and statistically stable model after 1000 Monte Carlo simulations (Mean R = 0.9348) compared with other models such as Boosted (Mean R = 0.9192) and ELM (Mean R = 0.8703). Investigation on the performance of the models showed that the predictive capability of the ML models was greatly affected by the training/testing ratios, where the 70/30 one presented the best performance of the models. Concisely, the results presented herein showed an effective manner in selecting the appropriate ratios of datasets and the best ML model to predict the soil shear strength accurately, which would be helpful in the design and engineering phases of construction projects.

Particularly, using prosthetic and rehabilitation devices with human-machine interfaces can greatly improve the quality of life for impaired patients. In recent years, flexible electronic interfaces and soft robotics have attracted tremendous attention in this field due to their high biocompatibility, functionality, conformability, and low-cost. Flexible human-machine interfaces on soft robotics will make a promising alternative to conventional rigid devices, which can potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics in terms of rehabilitation feedback and user experience. In this review, the fundamental components of the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human-machine interfaces are summarized by recent and renowned applications in five primary areas: physical and chemical sensing, physiological recording, information processing and communication, soft robotic actuation, and feedback stimulation. This review further concludes by discussing the outlook and current challenges of these technologies as a human-machine interface in medical robotics.

The main objective of this study was to produce flood susceptibility maps for the province of Salzburg, Austria, using two multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models including analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and analytical network process (ANP) and two machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, we compare which of the MCDA and ML models are better suited for flood susceptibility and evaluate the use of Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility maps based on eleven flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), geology, rainfall, land cover, distance to roads and distance to drainage. The accuracy evaluation of the flood susceptibility maps through the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) method along with the relative flood density (R-Index) shows that RF (AUC = 87.8%) and SVM (AUC = 87%) outperform the ANP (AUC = 86.6%) and AHP (AUC = 85.9%) models. Therefore, the predictive performance of ML models was slightly better than the MCDA models. The DST could further increase the accuracy of both ML models (AUC = 88.3%) and MCDA models (AUC = 87.3%). However, the best accuracy (AUC = 89.3%) is reached through an ensemble of all four models.

Integration of machine learning and genome-scale metabolic modeling identifies multi-omics biomarkers for radiation resistance	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CANCER-CELLS; DNA-DAMAGE; RADIOTHERAPY; EXPRESSION; SURVIVAL; ASPIRIN; METHYLATION; HALLMARKS; APOPTOSIS; THERAPY	Resistance to ionizing radiation, a first-line therapy for many cancers, is a major clinical challenge. Personalized prediction of tumor radiosensitivity is not currently implemented clinically due to insufficient accuracy of existing machine learning classifiers. Despite the acknowledged role of tumor metabolism in radiation response, metabolomics data is rarely collected in large multi-omics initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and consequently omitted from algorithm development. In this study, we circumvent the paucity of personalized metabolomics information by characterizing 915 TCGA patient tumors with genome-scale metabolic Flux Balance Analysis models generated from transcriptomic and genomic datasets. Metabolic biomarkers differentiating radiation-sensitive and -resistant tumors are predicted and experimentally validated, enabling integration of metabolic features with other multi-omics datasets into ensemble-based machine learning classifiers for radiation response. These multi-omics classifiers show improved classification accuracy, identify clinical patient subgroups, and demonstrate the utility of personalized blood-based metabolic biomarkers for radiation sensitivity. The integration of machine learning with genome-scale metabolic modeling represents a significant methodological advancement for identifying prognostic metabolite biomarkers and predicting radiosensitivity for individual patients. Personalized prediction of tumor radiosensitivity would facilitate development of precision medicine workflows for cancer treatment. Here, the authors integrate machine learning and genome-scale metabolic modeling approaches to identify multi-omics biomarkers predictive of radiation response.

The early and accurate categorisation of patients is hugely important, as MND phenotypes are associated with markedly different prognoses, progression rates, care needs and benefit from divergent management strategies. The categorisation of patients shortly after symptom onset is challenging, and often lengthy clinical monitoring is needed to assign patients to the appropriate phenotypic subgroup. In this study, a multi-class machine-learning strategy was implemented to classify 300 patients based on their radiological profile into diagnostic labels along the UMN-LMN spectrum. A comprehensive panel of cortical thickness measures, subcortical grey matter variables, and white matter integrity metrics were evaluated in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Additional exploratory analyses were also carried out using discriminant function analyses (DFA). Excellent classification accuracy was achieved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the testing cohort (93.7%) using the MLP model, but poor diagnostic accuracy was detected for primary lateral sclerosis (43.8%) and poliomyelitis survivors (60%). Feature importance analyses highlighted the relevance of white matter diffusivity metrics and the evaluation of cerebellar indices, cingulate measures and thalamic radiation variables to discriminate MND phenotypes. Our data suggest that radiological data from single patients may be meaningfully interpreted if large training data sets are available and the provision of diagnostic probability outcomes may be clinically useful in patients with short symptom duration. The computational interpretation of multimodal radiology datasets herald viable diagnostic, prognostic and clinical trial applications.

Although advances have been made by viewing phonons as particles, the controllability should be enhanced by fully utilizing their wave nature. By considering phonons as coherent waves, herein we design an optimized aperiodic superlattice that minimizes the coherent phonon heat conduction by alternatingly coupling coherent phonon transport calculations and machine learning. The thermal conductivity of the fabricated aperiodic superlattice agrees well with the calculations over a temperature range of 77-300 K, indicating that complex aperiodic wave interference of coherent phonons can be controlled. The thermal conductivity of the aperiodic superlattice is significantly smaller than the conventional periodic superlattice due to enhanced phonon localization. The optimized aperiodic structure is formed by connecting weakly correlated local structures that introduce interference over broad phonon frequencies. Controlling coherent phonons by aperiodic interferences opens a new route for phonon engineering.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning in design of mechanical materials	MATERIALS HORIZONS			English	Review							DEEP MATERIAL NETWORK; CONSISTENT CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; STRUCTURE-PROPERTY LINKAGES; HIGH-CONTRAST COMPOSITES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOCALIZATION LINKAGES; ELASTIC LOCALIZATION; STRUCTURE PREDICTION; BIOLOGICAL-MATERIALS; MATERIALS DISCOVERY	Artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, is becoming an important tool in the fields of materials and mechanical engineering, attributed to its power to predict materials properties, design de novo materials and discover new mechanisms beyond intuitions. As the structural complexity of novel materials soars, the material design problem to optimize mechanical behaviors can involve massive design spaces that are intractable for conventional methods. Addressing this challenge, ML models trained from large material datasets that relate structure, properties and function at multiple hierarchical levels have offered new avenues for fast exploration of the design spaces. The performance of a ML-based materials design approach relies on the collection or generation of a large dataset that is properly preprocessed using the domain knowledge of materials science underlying chemical and physical concepts, and a suitable selection of the applied ML model. Recent breakthroughs in ML techniques have created vast opportunities for not only overcoming long-standing mechanics problems but also for developing unprecedented materials design strategies. In this review, we first present a brief introduction of state-of-the-art ML models, algorithms and structures. Then, we discuss the importance of data collection, generation and preprocessing. The applications in mechanical property prediction, materials design and computational methods using ML-based approaches are summarized, followed by perspectives on opportunities and open challenges in this emerging and exciting field.

However, sharing data is full of challenges due to the increasing demands of privacy and security with the growing use of smart mobile devices and Internet of thing (IoT) devices. Federated learning provides a potential solution to privacy-preserving and secure machine learning, by means of jointly training a global model without uploading data distributed on multiple devices to a central server. However, most existing work on federated learning adopts machine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these models contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be transmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication costs. To address this issue, we propose a federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ) algorithm, which optimizes the quantized networks on the clients through a self-learning quantization factor. Theoretical proofs of the convergence of quantization factors, unbiasedness of FTTQ, as well as a reduced weight divergence are given. On the basis of FTTQ, we propose a ternary federated averaging protocol (T-FedAvg) to reduce the upstream and downstream communication of federated learning systems. Empirical experiments are conducted to train widely used deep learning models on publicly available data sets, and our results demonstrate that the proposed T-FedAvg is effective in reducing communication costs and can even achieve slightly better performance on non-IID data in contrast to the canonical federated learning algorithms.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress to a severe form of pneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. While medical imaging is not currently recommended in Canada for primary diagnosis of COVID-19, computer-aided diagnosis systems could assist in the early detection of COVID-19 abnormalities and help to monitor the progression of the disease, potentially reduce mortality rates. In this study, we compare popular deep learningbased feature extraction frameworks for automatic COVID-19 classification. To obtain the most accurate feature, which is an essential component of learning, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, ResNet, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, VGGNet, NASNet were chosen amongst a pool of deep convolutional neural networks. The extracted features were then fed into several machine learning classifiers to classify subjects as either a case of COVID-19 or a control. This approach avoided task-specific data pre-processing methods to support a better generalization ability for unseen data. The performance of the proposed method was validated on a publicly available COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray and CT images. The DenseNet121 feature extractor with Bagging tree classifier achieved the best performance with 99% classification accuracy. The second-best learner was a hybrid of the a ResNet50 feature extractor trained by LightGBM with an accuracy of 98%.

Anatole			Alchemical and structural distribution based representation for universal quantum machine learning	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-PROPERTIES; CHEMICAL SPACE; MODELS; APPROXIMATION; PREDICTIONS; POTENTIALS; NETWORKS; SOLIDS; KERNEL	We introduce a representation of any atom in any chemical environment for the automatized generation of universal kernel ridge regression-based quantum machine learning (QML) models of electronic properties, trained throughout chemical compound space. The representation is based on Gaussian distribution functions, scaled by power laws and explicitly accounting for structural as well as elemental degrees of freedom. The elemental components help us to lower the QML model's learning curve, and, through interpolation across the periodic table, even enable "alchemical extrapolation" to covalent bonding between elements not part of training. This point is demonstrated for the prediction of covalent binding in single, double, and triple bonds among main-group elements as well as for atomization energies in organic molecules. We present numerical evidence that resulting QML energy models, after training on a few thousand random training instances, reach chemical accuracy for out-of-sample compounds. Compound datasets studied include thousands of structurally and compositionally diverse organic molecules, non-covalently bonded protein side-chains, (H2O)(40)-clusters, and crystalline solids. Learning curves for QML models also indicate competitive predictive power for various other electronic ground state properties of organic molecules, calculated with hybrid density functional theory, including polarizability, heat-capacity, HOMO-LUMO eigenvalues and gap, zero point vibrational energy, dipole moment, and highest vibrational fundamental frequency.

Impairment in patient screening and risk management plays a fundamental role on how governments and authorities are directing resources, planning reopening, as well as sanitary countermeasures, especially in regions where poverty is a major component in the equation. An efficient diagnostic method must be highly accurate, while having a cost-effective profile. We combined a machine learning-based algorithm with mass spectrometry to create an expeditious platform that discriminate COVID-19 in plasma samples within minutes, while also providing tools for risk assessment, to assist healthcare professionals in patient management and decision-making. A cross-sectional study enrolled 815 patients (442 COVID-19, 350 controls and 23 COVID-19 suspicious) from three Brazilian epicenters from April to July 2020. We were able to elect and identify 19 molecules related to the disease's pathophysiology and several discriminating features to patient's health-related outcomes. The method applied for COVID-19 diagnosis showed specificity >96% and sensitivity >83%, and specificity >80% and sensitivity >85% during risk assessment, both from blinded data. Our method introduced a new approach for COVID-19 screening, providing the indirect detection of infection through metabolites and contextualizing the findings with the disease's pathophysiology. The pairwise analysis of biomarkers brought robustness to the model developed using machine learning algorithms, transforming this screening approach in a tool with great potential for real-world application.

The immune system may represent a new target to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic procedures but reliable biomarkers still need to be found. Methods: In our study we predicted the differential diagnosis of mood disorders by considering the plasma levels of 54 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors of 81 BD and 127 MDD depressed patients. Clinical diagnoses were predicted also against 32 healthy controls. Elastic net models, including 5000 non-parametric boot-strapping procedure and inner and outer 10-fold nested cross-validation were performed in order to identify the signatures for the disorders. Results: Results showed that the immune-inflammatory signature classifies the two disorders with a high accuracy (AUC = 97%), specifically 92% and 86% respectively for MDD and BD. MDD diagnosis was predicted by high levels of markers related to both pro-inflammatory (i.e. IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-7, IL-16) and regulatory responses (IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10), whereas BD by high levels of inflammatory markers (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL25, CCL27, CXCL11, IL-9 and TNF-alpha). Conclusions: Our findings provide novel tools for early diagnosis of BD, strengthening the impact of biomarkers research into clinical practice, and new insights for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for depressive disorders.

Overwhelmed health facilities have endeavored to mitigate the pandemic, but mortality of COVID-19 continues to increase. Here, we present a mortality risk prediction model for COVID-19 (MRPMC) that uses patients' clinical data on admission to stratify patients by mortality risk, which enables prediction of physiological deterioration and death up to 20 days in advance. This ensemble model is built using four machine learning methods including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, and Neural Network. We validate MRPMC in an internal validation cohort and two external validation cohorts, where it achieves an AUC of 0.9621 (95% CI: 0.9464-0.9778), 0.9760 (0.9613-0.9906), and 0.9246 (0.8763-0.9729), respectively. This model enables expeditious and accurate mortality risk stratification of patients with COVID-19, and potentially facilitates more responsive health systems that are conducive to high risk COVID-19 patients. Methods to stratify patients according to mortality risk are essential to allocate limited heath resources during the COVID-19 crisis. Here, using machine learning methods, the authors present a mortality risk prediction model for COVID-19 that uses patients' clinical data on admission to stratify patients by mortality risk.

Machine learning the quantum-chemical properties of metal-organic frameworks for accelerated materials discovery	MATTER			English	Article							SINGLE-CRYSTAL; MOLECULAR SIMULATION; COMPUTATION-READY; HYDROGEN STORAGE; REDOX ACTIVITY; BIG DATA; EFFICIENT; ADSORPTION; OXIDATION; MOFS	The modular nature of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) enables synthetic control over their physical and chemical properties, but it can be difficult to know which MOFs would be optimal for a given application. High-throughput computational screening and machine learning are promising routes to efficiently navigate the vast chemical space of MOFs but have rarely been used for the prediction of properties that need to be calculated by quantum mechanical methods. Here, we introduce the Quantum MOF (QMOF) database, a publicly available database of computed quantum-chemical properties for more than 14,000 experimentally synthesized MOFs. Throughout this study, we demonstrate how machine learning models trained on the QMOF database can be used to rapidly discover MOFs with targeted electronic structure properties, using the prediction of theoretically computed band gaps as a representative example. We conclude by highlighting several MOFs predicted to have low band gaps, a challenging task given the electronically insulating nature of most MOFs.

Upcoming 5G systems are evolving to support exploding mobile traffic volumes, real-time extraction of fine-grained analytics, and agile management of network resources, so as to maximize user experience. Fulfilling these tasks is challenging, as mobile environments are increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and evolving. One potential solution is to resort to advanced machine learning techniques, in order to help manage the rise in data volumes and algorithm-driven applications. The recent success of deep learning underpins new and powerful tools that tackle problems in this space. In this paper, we bridge the gap between deep learning and mobile and wireless networking research, by presenting a comprehensive survey of the crossovers between the two areas. We first briefly introduce essential background and state-of-the-art in deep learning techniques with potential applications to networking. We then discuss several techniques and platforms that facilitate the efficient deployment of deep learning onto mobile systems. Subsequently, we provide an encyclopedic review of mobile and wireless networking research based on deep learning, which we categorize by different domains. Drawing from our experience, we discuss how to tailor deep learning to mobile environments. We complete this survey by pinpointing current challenges and open future directions for research.

Standard approaches assume separate computation and communication, where local gradient estimates are compressed and transmitted to the PS over orthogonal links. Following this digital approach, we introduce D-DSGD, in which the wireless devices employ gradient quantization and error accumulation, and transmit their gradient estimates to the PS over a multiple access channel (MAC). We then introduce a novel analog scheme, called A-DSGD, which exploits the additive nature of the wireless MAC for over-the-air gradient computation, and provide convergence analysis for this approach. In A-DSGD, the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates, and then project them to a lower dimensional space imposed by the available channel bandwidth. These projections are sent directly over the MAC without employing any digital code. Numerical results show that A-DSGD converges faster than D-DSGD thanks to its more efficient use of the limited bandwidth and the natural alignment of the gradient estimates over the channel. The improvement is particularly compelling at low power and low bandwidth regimes. We also illustrate for a classification problem that, A-DSGD is more robust to bias in data distribution across devices, while D-DSGD significantly outperforms other digital schemes in the literature. We also observe that both D-DSGD and A-DSGD perform better with the number of devices, showing their ability in harnessing the computation power of edge devices.

Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.

However, its practical benefits still remain unproven in real-world applications, particularly in polymer science. We demonstrate the successful discovery of new polymers with high thermal conductivity, inspired by machine-learning-assisted polymer chemistry. This discovery was made by the interplay between machine intelligence trained on a substantially limited amount of polymeric properties data, expertise from laboratory synthesis and advanced technologies for thermophysical property measurements. Using a molecular design algorithm trained to recognize quantitative structure-property relationships with respect to thermal conductivity and other targeted polymeric properties, we identified thousands of promising hypothetical polymers. From these candidates, three were selected for monomer synthesis and polymerization because of their synthetic accessibility and their potential for ease of processing in further applications. The synthesized polymers reached thermal conductivities of 0.18-0.41 W/mK, which are comparable to those of state-of-the-art polymers in non-composite thermo-plastics.

The 2016 Dyn cyberattack exposed the critical fault-lines among smart networks. Security of IoT has become a critical concern. The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of IoT but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved both ways, in terms of complexity and diversity. Hence, to identify and prevent or detect novel attacks, it is important to analyze techniques in IoT context. This survey classifies the IoT security threats and challenges for IoT networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs); hence, this paper reviews existing NIDS implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art NIDS proposals in the IoT context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning (ML) NIDS techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on IoT NIDS deployed via ML since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of NIDSs deploying different aspects of learning techniques for IoT, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems. We believe that, this paper will be useful for academia and industry research, first, to identify IoT threats and challenges, second, to implement their own NIDS and finally to propose new smart techniques in IoT context considering IoT limitations. Moreover, the survey will enable security individuals differentiate IoT NIDS from traditional ones.

Unsupervised representation learning becomes meritorious as it has no necessity of label information with observed data. Due to the highly time-consuming learning of deep-learning models, there are many machine-learning models directly adapting well-trained deep models that are obtained in a supervised and end-to-end manner as feature abstractors to distinct problems. However, it is obvious that different machine-learning tasks require disparate representation of original input data. Taking human action recognition as an example, it is well known that human actions in a video sequence are 3-D signals containing both visual appearance and motion dynamics of humans and objects. Therefore, the data representation approaches with the capabilities to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in videos are meaningful. Most of the existing human motion recognition models build classifiers based on deep-learning structures such as deep convolutional networks. These models require a large quantity of training videos with annotations. Meanwhile, these supervised models cannot recognize samples from the distinct dataset without retraining. In this article, we propose a new 3-D deconvolutional network (3DDN) for representation learning of high-dimensional video data, in which the high-level features are obtained through the optimization approach. The proposed 3DDN decomposes the video frames into spatiotemporal features under a sparse constraint in an unsupervised way. In addition, it also can be regarded as a building block to develop deep architectures by stacking. The high-level representation of input sequential data can be used in multiple downstream machine-learning tasks, we evaluate the proposed 3DDN and its deep models in human action recognition. The experimental results from three datasets: 1) KTH data; 2) HMDB-51; and 3) UCF-101, demonstrate that the proposed 3DDN is an alternative approach to feedforward convolutional neural networks (CNNs), that attains comparable results.

Up to this moment, there have been no signs of remission, and there is no proven effective cure. Vaccination is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have a significant impact on the progression toward achieving herd immunity. Objective: This study aimed to use machine learning methods to extract topics and sentiments relating to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. Methods: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed tweets by visualizing high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model to identify commonly discussed topics in a large sample of tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions related to COVID-19 vaccination in Australia. Results: Our analysis identified 3 LDA topics: (1) attitudes toward COVID-19 and its vaccination, (2) advocating infection control measures against COVID-19, and (3) misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control. Nearly two-thirds of the sentiments of all tweets expressed a positive public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine; around one-third were negative. Among the 8 basic emotions, trust and anticipation were the two prominent positive emotions observed in the tweets, while fear was the top negative emotion. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that some Twitter users in Australia supported infection control measures against COVID-19 and refuted misinformation. However, those who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 may have rationalized their position on COVID-19 vaccination with conspiracy theories. We also noticed that the level of positive sentiment among the public may not be sufficient to increase vaccination coverage to a level high enough to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. Governments should explore public opinion and sentiments toward COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme in addition to supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.

Accurate prediction of protein subcellular localization is a fundamental and challenging problem, for which machine learning algorithms have been widely used. Traditionally, the performance of PSL prediction highly depends on handcrafted feature descriptors to represent proteins. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a hot research topic in the field of machine learning, achieving outstanding success in learning high-level latent features within data samples. In this paper, to accurately predict protein subcellular locations, we propose a deep learning based predictor called DeepPSL by using Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) networks. In this predictor, we automatically learn high-level and abstract feature representations of proteins by exploring non-linear relations among diverse subcellular locations, addressing the problem of the need of handcrafted feature representations. Experimental results evaluated with three-fold cross validation show that the proposed DeepPSL outperforms traditional machine learning based methods. It is expected that DeepPSL, as the first predictor in the field of PSL prediction, has great potential to be a powerful computational method complementary to existing tools. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study provides an exhaustive comparison of sentiment analysis methods, using a validation set of Dutch economic headlines to compare the performance of manual annotation, crowd coding, numerous dictionaries and machine learning using both traditional and deep learning algorithms. The three main conclusions of this article are that: (1) The best performance is still attained with trained human or crowd coding; (2) None of the used dictionaries come close to acceptable levels of validity; and (3) machine learning, especially deep learning, substantially outperforms dictionary-based methods but falls short of human performance. From these findings, we stress the importance of always validating automatic text analysis methods before usage. Moreover, we provide a recommended step-by-step approach for (automated) text analysis projects to ensure both efficiency and validity.	[van Atteveldt, Wouter; van der Velden, Mariken A. C.

While primarily designed for archiving patient information and performing administrative healthcare tasks like billing, many researchers have found secondary use of these records for various clinical informatics applications. Over the same period, the machine learning community has seen widespread advances in the field of deep learning. In this review, we survey the current research on applying deep learning to clinical tasks based on EHR data, where we find a variety of deep learning techniques and frameworks being applied to several types of clinical applications including information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, and deidentification. We identify several limitations of current research involving topics such as model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and lack of universal benchmarks. We conclude by summarizing the state of the field and identifying avenues of future deep EHR research.

We consider classical ML models that perform a measurement and record the classical outcome after each run of epsilon, and quantum ML models that can access epsilon coherently to acquire quantum data; the classical or quantum data are then used to predict the outcomes of future experiments. We prove that for any input distribution D(x), a classical ML model can provide accurate predictions on average by accessing epsilon a number of times comparable to the optimal quantum ML model. In contrast, for achieving an accurate prediction on all inputs, we prove that the exponential quantum advantage is possible. For example, to predict the expectations of all Pauli observables in an n-qubit system rho, classical ML models require 2(Omega)((n)) copies of rho, but we present a quantum ML model using only O(n) copies. Our results clarify where the quantum advantage is possible and highlight the potential for classical ML models to address challenging quantum problems in physics and chemistry.

Accordingly, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been optimized to estimate the moment and rotation in steel rack connection based on variable input characteristics as beam depth, column thickness, connector depth, moment and loading. The prediction and estimating of ELM has been juxtaposed with genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) methods. Test outcomes have indicated a surpass in accuracy predicting and the capability of generalization in ELM approach than GP or ANN. Therefore, the application of ELM has been basically promised as an alternative way to estimate the moment and rotation of steel rack connection. Further particulars are presented in details in results and discussion.

A good product is more vital than having more of the same item for a customer's enjoyment. The client has a significant role in determining the quality of a product. Another way to think about quality is as the total of all the characteristics that contribute to the creation of items that the client enjoys. Recently, the application of machine vision and image processing technology to improve the surface quality of fruits and other foods has increased significantly. This is primarily because these technologies make significant advancements in areas where the human eye falls short. This means that, by utilizing computer vision and image processing techniques, time-consuming and subjective industrial quality control processes can be eliminated. This article discusses how to check and assess food using picture segmentation and machine learning. It is capable of classifying fruits and determining whether a piece of fruit is rotten. To begin, Gaussian elimination is used to remove noise from images. Then, photos are subjected to histogram equalization in order to improve their quality. Segmentation of the image is carried out using the K-means clustering technique. Then, fruit photos are classified using machine learning methods such as KNN, SVM, and C4.5. These algorithms determine if a fruit is damaged or not.

After initial screening, 62 studies are analysed and the authors find they all have methodological flaws standing in the way of clinical utility. The authors have several recommendations to address these issues. Machine learning methods offer great promise for fast and accurate detection and prognostication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from standard-of-care chest radiographs (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT) images. Many articles have been published in 2020 describing new machine learning-based models for both of these tasks, but it is unclear which are of potential clinical utility. In this systematic review, we consider all published papers and preprints, for the period from 1 January 2020 to 3 October 2020, which describe new machine learning models for the diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 from CXR or CT images. All manuscripts uploaded to bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv along with all entries in EMBASE and MEDLINE in this timeframe are considered. Our search identified 2,212 studies, of which 415 were included after initial screening and, after quality screening, 62 studies were included in this systematic review. Our review finds that none of the models identified are of potential clinical use due to methodological flaws and/or underlying biases. This is a major weakness, given the urgency with which validated COVID-19 models are needed. To address this, we give many recommendations which, if followed, will solve these issues and lead to higher-quality model development and well-documented manuscripts.

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms provide efficient and effective data analysis models to uncover hidden patterns and other meaningful information from the considerable amount of health data that conventional analytics are not able to discover in a reasonable time. In particular, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been shown as promising methods in pattern recognition in the healthcare systems. Motivated by this consideration, the contribution of this paper is to investigate the deep learning approaches applied to healthcare systems by reviewing the cutting-edge network architectures, applications, and industrial trends. The goal is first to provide extensive insight into the application of deep learning models in healthcare solutions to bridge deep learning techniques and human healthcare interpretability. And then, to present the existing open challenges and future directions.

While there are some emerging practices surrounding responsible ML as well as regulatory frameworks, the traditional role of research ethics oversight has been relatively unexplored regarding its relevance for clinical ML. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive research ethics framework that can apply to the systematic inquiry of ML research across its development cycle. The pathway consists of three stages: (1) exploratory, hypothesis-generating data access; (2) silent period evaluation; (3) prospective clinical evaluation. We connect each stage to its literature and ethical justification and suggest adaptations to traditional paradigms to suit ML while maintaining ethical rigor and the protection of individuals. This pathway can accommodate a multitude of research designs from observational to controlled trials, and the stages can apply individually to a variety of ML applications.

A new era: artificial intelligence and machine learning in prostate cancer	NATURE REVIEWS UROLOGY			English	Review							GENOMIC CLASSIFIER; METASTASIS; DIAGNOSIS; IMAGES; RISK; MRI	Artificial intelligence (AI)-the ability of a machine to perform cognitive tasks to achieve a particular goal based on provided data-is revolutionizing and reshaping our health-care systems. The current availability of ever-increasing computational power, highly developed pattern recognition algorithms and advanced image processing software working at very high speeds has led to the emergence of computer-based systems that are trained to perform complex tasks in bioinformatics, medical imaging and medical robotics. Accessibility to 'big data' enables the 'cognitive' computer to scan billions of bits of unstructured information, extract the relevant information and recognize complex patterns with increasing confidence. Computer-based decision-support systems based on machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize medicine by performing complex tasks that are currently assigned to specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. These characteristics could be especially helpful in the management of prostate cancer, with growing applications in diagnostic imaging, surgical interventions, skills training and assessment, digital pathology and genomics. Medicine must adapt to this changing world, and urologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, as high-volume users of imaging and pathology, need to understand this burgeoning science and acknowledge that the development of highly accurate AI-based decision-support applications of ML will require collaboration between data scientists, computer researchers and engineers.

Remote sensing (RS) systems are being more widely used in building decision support tools for contemporary farming systems to improve yield production and nitrogen management while reducing operating costs and environmental impact. However, RS based approaches require processing of enormous amounts of remotely sensed data from different platforms and, therefore, greater attention is currently being devoted to machine learning (ML) methods. This is due to the capability of machine learning based systems to process a large number of inputs and handle non-linear tasks. This paper discusses research developments conducted within the last 15 years on machine learning based techniques for accurate crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation. The paper concludes that the rapid advances in sensing technologies and ML techniques will provide cost-effective and comprehensive solutions for better crop and environment state estimation and decision making. More targeted application of the sensor platforms and ML techniques, the fusion of different sensor modalities and expert knowledge, and the development of hybrid systems combining different ML and signal processing techniques are all likely to be part of precision agriculture (PA) in the near future.

J	Huang, FM; Zhang, J; Zhou, CB; Wang, YH; Huang, JS; Zhu, L				Huang, Faming; Zhang, Jing; Zhou, Chuangbing; Wang, Yuhao; Huang, Jinsong; Zhu, Li			A deep learning algorithm using a fully connected sparse autoencoder neural network for landslide susceptibility prediction	LANDSLIDES			English	Article						Landslide susceptibility prediction; Deep learning; Fully connected sparse autoencoder; Support vector machine; Back-propagation neural network	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SPATIAL PREDICTION; FREQUENCY RATIO; MODEL; MAP; PROVINCE; COUNTY; CHINA	The environmental factors of landslide susceptibility are generally uncorrelated or non-linearly correlated, resulting in the limited prediction performances of conventional machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP). Deep learning methods can exploit low-level features and high-level representations of information from environmental factors. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based algorithm, the fully connected spare autoencoder (FC-SAE), is proposed for LSP. The FC-SAE consists of four steps: raw feature dropout in input layers, a sparse feature encoder in hidden layers, sparse feature extraction in output layers, and classification and prediction. The Sinan County of Guizhou Province in China, with a total of 23,195 landslide grid cells (306 recorded landslides) and 23,195 randomly selected non-landslide grid cells, was used as study case. The frequency ratio values of 27 environmental factors were taken as the input variables of FC-SAE. All 46,390 landslide and non-landslide grid cells were randomly divided into a training dataset (70%) and a test dataset (30%). By analyzing real landslide/non-landslide data, the performances of the FC-SAE and two other conventional machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN), were compared. The results show that the prediction rate and total accuracies of the FC-SAE are 0.854 and 85.2% which are higher than those of the SVM-only (0.827 and 81.56%) and BPNN (0.819 and 80.86%), respectively. In conclusion, the asymmetric and unsupervised FC-SAE can extract optimal non-linear features from environmental factors successfully, outperforms some conventional machine learning methods, and is promising for LSP.

The parallel machines are speed-scaling. To solve the problem, we propose a memetic differential evolution (MDE) algorithm. Since the problem involves assigning jobs to machines and selecting an appropriate processing speed level for each job, we characterize each individual by two vectors: a job-machine assignment vector and a speed vector. To accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, only the speed vector of each individual evolves and a list scheduling heuristic is applied to derive its job-machine assignment vector based on its speed vector. To further enhance the algorithm, we propose efficient speed adjusting and job-machine swap heuristics and integrate them into the algorithm as a local search approach by an adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy. Computational results reveal that the incorporation of list scheduling heuristic and local search greatly strengthens the algorithm. Computational experiments also show that the proposed MDE algorithm outperforms SPEA-II and NSGA-II significantly. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the high attrition rates in MOOCs have often been cited as a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Traditional educational approaches are usually unable to identify such large-scale number of at-risk students in danger of dropping out in time to support effective intervention design. While building dropout prediction models using learning analytics are promising in informing intervention design for these at-risk students, results of the current prediction model construction methods do not enable personalized intervention for these students. In this study, we take an initial step to optimize the dropout prediction model performance toward intervention personalization for at-risk students in MOOCs. Specifically, based on a temporal prediction mechanism, this study proposes to use the deep learning algorithm to construct the dropout prediction model and further produce the predicted individual student dropout probability. By taking advantage of the power of deep learning, this approach not only constructs more accurate dropout prediction models compared with baseline algorithms but also comes up with an approach to personalize and prioritize intervention for at-risk students in MOOCs through using individual drop out probabilities. The findings from this study and implications are then discussed.

In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generativemodels have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials.

Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.

However, the electrocardiogram signal is very weak, the anti-interference ability is poor, easy to be affected by the noise. Doctors face difficulties in diagnosing arrhythmias. Therefore, automatic recognition and classification of ECG signals is an important and indispensable task. Since the beginning of the 21 st century, deep learning has developed rapidly and has shown the most advanced performance in various fields. This paper presents a method of combining (Convolutional neural network) CNN and ELM (extreme learning machine). The accuracy rate is 97.50%.

Automated cognitive health assessment in smart homes using machine learning	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Cognitive assessment; Healthcare; Internet of Things; Remote Monitoring; Smart cities; Smart homes; Sustainability; MCI; Dementia; Machine learning	ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CITIES	The Internet of Things (IoT) provides smart solutions for future urban communities to address key benefits with the least human intercession. A smart home offers the necessary capabilities to promote efficiency and sustainability to a resident with their healthcare-related, social, and emotional needs. In particular, it provides an opportunity to assess the functional health ability of the elderly or individuals with cognitive impairment in performing daily life activities. This work proposes an approach named Cognitive Assessment of Smart Home Resident (CA-SHR) to measure the ability of smart home residents in executing simple to complex activities of daily living using pre-defined scores assigned by a neuropsychologist. CA-SHR also measures the quality of tasks performed by the participants using supervised classification. Furthermore, CA-SHR provides a temporal feature analysis to estimate if the temporal features help to detect impaired individuals effectively. The goal of this study is to detect cognitively impaired individuals in their early stages. CA-SHR assess the health condition of individuals through significant features and improving the representation of dementia patients. For the classification of individuals into healthy, Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and dementia categories, we use ensemble AdaBoost. This results in improving the reliability of the CA-SHR through the correct assignment of labels to the smart home resident compared with existing techniques.

This highly contagious disease can easily spread, and if not controlled in a timely fashion, can rapidly incapacitate healthcare systems. The current standard diagnosis method, the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT- PCR), is time consuming, and subject to low sensitivity. Chest Radiograph (CXR), the first imaging modality to be used, is readily available and gives immediate results. However, it has notoriously lower sensitivity than Computed Tomography (CT), which can be used efficiently to complement other diagnostic methods. This paper introduces a new COVID-19 CT scan dataset, referred to as COVID-CT-MD, consisting of not only COVID-19 cases, but also healthy and participants infected by Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

These multiple properties must be simultaneously optimized in a very broad design space of protein sequences and buffer compositions. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI), and especially machine learning (ML), have great potential to accelerate and improve the optimization of protein properties, increasing their activity and safety as well as decreasing their development time and manufacturing costs. We highlight the emerging applications of ML in biologics discovery and development, focusing on protein engineering, early biophysical screening, and formulation. We discuss the power of ML in extracting information from complex datasets and in reducing the necessary experimental effort to simultaneously achieve multiple quality targets. We finally anticipate possible future interventions of AI in several steps of the biological landscape.

These dimensions include a myriad of properties describing genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, phenotype, and lifestyle. No single data type, however, can capture the complexity of all the factors relevant to understanding a phenomenon such as a disease. Integrative methods that combine data from multiple technologies have thus emerged as critical statistical and computational approaches. The key challenge in developing such approaches is the identification of effective models to provide a comprehensive and relevant systems view. An ideal method can answer a biological or medical question, identifying important features and predicting outcomes, by harnessing heterogeneous data across several dimensions of biological variation. In this Review, we describe the principles of data integration and discuss current methods and available implementations. We provide examples of successful data integration in biology and medicine. Finally, we discuss current challenges in biomedical integrative methods and our perspective on the future development of the field.

J	Yang, K; Jiang, T; Shi, YM; Ding, Z				Yang, Kai; Jiang, Tao; Shi, Yuanming; Ding, Zhi			Federated Learning via Over-the-Air Computation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Federated learning; over-the-air computation; edge machine learning; sparse optimization; low-rank optimization; difference-of-convex-functions; DC programming	ANALOG FUNCTION COMPUTATION; OPTIMIZATION; SPARSE; DESIGN	The stringent requirements for low-latency and privacy of the emerging high-stake applications with intelligent devices such as drones and smart vehicles make the cloud computing inapplicable in these scenarios. Instead, edge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training and inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized data center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for training a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth limited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and address the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different devices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model aggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each selected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main bottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel. This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in the procedure of device selection. A DC algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC program with global convergence guarantees. The algorithmic advantages and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical results.

Learning-Based Model Predictive Control: Toward Safe Learning in Control	ANNUAL REVIEW OF CONTROL, ROBOTICS, AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS, VOL 3, 2020	Annual Review of Control Robotics and Autonomous Systems		English	Article; Book Chapter						model predictive control; learning-based control; safe learning; adaptive control; autonomous systems	LINEAR-SYSTEMS; STOCHASTIC MPC; SCENARIO; OPTIMIZATION; UNCERTAINTY; STABILITY; TRACKING; LOOP; VIEW	Recent successes in the field of machine learning, as well as the availability of increased sensing and computational capabilities in modern control systems, have led to a growing interest in learning and data-driven control techniques. Model predictive control (MPC), as the prime methodology for constrained control, offers a significant opportunity to exploit the abundance of data in a reliable manner, particularly while taking safety constraints into account. This review aims at summarizing and categorizing previous research on learning-based MPC, i.e., the integration or combination of MPC with learning methods, for which we consider three main categories. Most of the research addresses learning for automatic improvement of the prediction model from recorded data. There is, however, also an increasing interest in techniques to infer the parameterization of the MPC controller, i.e., the cost and constraints, that lead to the best closed-loop performance. Finally, we discuss concepts that leverage MPC to augment learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.

ML has recently exploded in popularity in many fields, including meteorology. Although ML has been successful in meteorology, it has not been as widely accepted, primarily due to the perception that ML models are "black boxes," meaning the ML methods are thought to take inputs and provide outputs but not to yield physically interpretable information to the user. This paper introduces and demonstrates multiple MIV techniques for both traditional ML and deep learning, to enable meteorologists to understand what ML models have learned. We discuss permutation-based predictor importance, forward and backward selection, saliency maps, class-activation maps, backward optimization, and novelty detection. We apply these methods at multiple spatiotemporal scales to tornado, hail, winter precipitation type, and convective-storm mode. By analyzing such a wide variety of applications, we intend for this work to demystify the black box of ML, offer insight in applying MIV techniques, and serve as a MIV toolbox for meteorologists and other physical scientists.

Peter; Thomas, Luc; Zalaudek, Iris; Kittler, Harald			Comparison of the accuracy of human readers versus machine-learning algorithms for pigmented skin lesion classification: an open, web-based, international, diagnostic study	LANCET ONCOLOGY			English	Article							MELANOMA; PERFORMANCE; DERMATOSCOPY; MULTICENTER; DERMOSCOPY; COMPUTER; CANCER; SYSTEM	Background Whether machine-learning algorithms can diagnose all pigmented skin lesions as accurately as human experts is unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms with human readers for all clinically relevant types of benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions. Methods For this open, web-based, international, diagnostic study, human readers were asked to diagnose dermatoscopic images selected randomly in 30-image batches from a test set of 1511 images. The diagnoses from human readers were compared with those of 139 algorithms created by 77 machine-learning labs, who participated in the International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 challenge and received a training set of 10 015 images in advance. The ground truth of each lesion fell into one of seven predefined disease categories: intraepithelial carcinoma including actinic keratoses and Bowen's disease; basal cell carcinoma; benign keratinocytic lesions including solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis and lichen planus-like keratosis; dermatofibroma; melanoma; melanocytic nevus; and vascular lesions. The two main outcomes were the differences in the number of correct specific diagnoses per batch between all human readers and the top three algorithms, and between human experts and the top three algorithms. Findings Between Aug 4, 2018, and Sept 30, 2018, 511 human readers from 63 countries had at least one attempt in the reader study. 283 (55.4%) of 511 human readers were board-certified dermatologists, 118 (23.1%) were dermatology residents, and 83 (16.2%) were general practitioners. When comparing all human readers with all machine-learning algorithms, the algorithms achieved a mean of 2.01 (95% CI 1.97 to 2.04; p<0.0001) more correct diagnoses (17.91 [SD 3.42] vs 19.92 [4.27]). 27 human experts with more than 10 years of experience achieved a mean of 18.78 (SD 3.15) correct answers, compared with 25.43 (1.95) correct answers for the top three machine algorithms (mean difference 6.65, 95% CI 6.06-7.25; p<0.0001). The difference between human experts and the top three algorithms was significantly lower for images in the test set that were collected from sources not included in the training set (human underperformance of 11.4%, 95% CI 9.9-12.9 vs 3.6%, 0.8-6.3; p<0.0001). Interpretation State-of-the-art machine-learning classifiers outperformed human experts in the diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions and should have a more important role in clinical practice. However, a possible limitation of these algorithms is their decreased performance for out-of-distribution images, which should be addressed in future research. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The strength of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is comparatively lower than that of natural aggregate concrete. Several factors, including the recycled aggregate replacement ratio, parent concrete strength, water-cement ratio, water absorption, density of the recycled aggregate, etc., affect the RAC's strength. Several studies have been performed to study the impact of these factors individually. However, it is challenging to examine their combined impact on the strength of RAC through experimental investigations. Experimental studies involve casting, curing, and testing samples, for which substantial effort, price, and time are needed. For rapid and cost-effective research, it is critical to apply new methods to the stated purpose. In this research, the compressive and flexural strengths of RAC were predicted using ensemble machine learning methods, including gradient boosting and random forest. Twelve input factors were used in the dataset, and their influence on the strength of RAC was analyzed. The models were validated and compared using correlation coefficients (R-2), variance between predicted and experimental results, statistical tests, and k-fold analysis. The random forest approach outperformed gradient boosting in anticipating the strength of RAC, with an R-2 of 0.91 and 0.86 for compressive and flexural strength, respectively. The models' decreased error values, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE), confirmed the higher precision of the random forest models. The MAE values for the random forest models were 4.19 MPa and 0.56 MPa, whereas the MAE values for the gradient boosting models were 4.78 MPa and 0.64 MPa, for compressive and flexural strengths, respectively. Machine learning technologies will benefit the construction sector by facilitating the evaluation of material properties in a quick and cost-effective manner.

Here, we develop universal MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) models for accurate property prediction in both molecules and crystals. We demonstrate that the MEGNet models outperform prior ML models such as the SchNet in 11 out of 13 properties of the QM9 molecule data set. Similarly, we show that MEGNet models trained on similar to 60 000 crystals in the Materials Project substantially outperform prior ML models in the prediction of the formation energies, band gaps, and elastic moduli of crystals, achieving better than density functional theory accuracy over a much larger data set. We present two new strategies to address data limitations common in materials science and chemistry. First, we demonstrate a physically intuitive approach to unify four separate molecular MEGNet models for the internal energy at 0 K and room temperature, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy into a single free energy MEGNet model by incorporating the temperature, pressure, and entropy as global state inputs. Second, we show that the learned element embeddings in MEGNet models encode periodic chemical trends and can be transfer-learned from a property model trained on a larger data set (formation energies) to improve property models with smaller amounts of data (band gaps and elastic moduli).

There is a growing interest in obtaining such datasets for medical image analysis applications. However, the impact of label noise has not received sufficient attention. Recent studies have shown that label noise can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models in many machine learning and computer vision applications. This is especially concerning for medical applications, where datasets are typically small, labeling requires domain expertise and suffers from high interand intra-observer variability, and erroneous predictions may influence decisions that directly impact human health. In this paper, we first review the state-of-theart in handling label noise in deep learning. Then, we review studies that have dealt with label noise in deep learning for medical image analysis. Our review shows that recent progress on handling label noise in deep learning has gone largely unnoticed by the medical image analysis community. To help achieve a better understanding of the extent of the problem and its potential remedies, we conducted experiments with three medical imaging datasets with different types of label noise, where we investigated several existing strategies and developed new methods to combat the negative effect of label noise. Based on the results of these experiments and our review of the literature, we have made recommendations on methods that can be used to alleviate the effects of different types of label noise on deep models trained for medical image analysis. We hope that this article helps the medical image analysis researchers and developers in choosing and devising new techniques that effectively handle label noise in deep learning.

While medical imaging datasets have been growing in size, a challenge for supervised ML algorithms that is frequently mentioned is the lack of annotated data. As a result, various methods that can learn with less/other types of supervision, have been proposed. We give an overview of semi-supervised, multiple instance, and transfer learning in medical imaging, both in diagnosis or segmentation tasks. We also discuss connections between these learning scenarios, and opportunities for future research.

Machine learning algorithm validation with a limited sample size	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION	Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion tracking, eye-tracking and many other technology-based data collection methods have led to a torrent of high dimensional datasets, which commonly have a small number of samples because of the intrinsic high cost of data collection involving human participants. High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.

Recently, the security vulnerability of DL algorithms to adversarial samples has been widely recognized. The fabricated samples can lead to various misbehaviors of the DL models while being perceived as benign by humans. Successful implementations of adversarial attacks in real physical-world scenarios further demonstrate their practicality. Hence, adversarial attack and defense techniques have attracted increasing attention from both machine learning and security communities and have become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we first introduce the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of adversarial attack techniques. We then describe a few research efforts on the defense techniques, which cover the broad frontier in the field.

J	Nguyen, VN; Jenssen, R; Roverso, D				Van Nhan Nguyen; Jenssen, Robert; Roverso, Davide			Automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection: A review of current status and the potential role of deep learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Review						Power line inspection; Vision-based inspection; Deep learning; UAVs		To maintain the reliability, availability, and sustainability of electricity supply, electricity companies regularly perform visual inspections on their transmission and distribution networks. These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges. Finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook for the future of this field and propose potential next steps for implementing the concept.

Irrigation accounts for a sizable amount of water use. Crop irrigation is an important step in crop yield prediction. Field harvesting is very reliant on human supervision and experience. It is critical to safeguard the field's water supply. The shortage of fresh water is a major challenge for the world, and the situation will deteriorate further in the next years. As a result of the aforementioned challenges, smart irrigation and precision farming are the only viable solutions. Only with the emergence of the Internet of Things and machine learning have smart irrigation and precision agriculture become economically viable. Increased efficiency, expense optimization, energy maximization, forecasting, and general public convenience are all benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT). As systems and data processing become more diversified, security issues arise. Security and privacy concerns are impeding the growth of the Internet of Things. This article establishes a framework for detecting and classifying intrusions into IoT networks used in agriculture. Security and privacy are major concerns not only in agriculture-related IoT networks but in all applications of the Internet of Things as well. In this framework, the NSL KDD data set is used as an input data set. In the preprocessing of the NSL-KDD data set, first all symbolic features are converted to numeric features. Feature extraction is performed using principal component analysis. Then, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, linear regression, and random forest are used to classify preprocessed data set. Performance comparisons of machine learning algorithms are evaluated on the basis of accuracy, precision, and recall parameters.

Illness diagnosis plays a critical role in designating treatment strategies, which are highly related to patient safety. Nowadays, numerous classification models in data mining domains are adapted to breast cancer diagnosis based on patients' historical medical records. However, the performance of each algorithm depends on various model configurations, such as input feature types and model parameters. To tackle the limitation of individual model performance, this research focuses on breast cancer diagnosis that uses an SVM-based ensemble learning algorithm to reduce the diagnosis variance and increase diagnosis accuracy. Twelve different SVMs, based on the proposed Weighted Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Ensemble (WAUCE) approach, are hybridized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program breast cancer datasets have been studied. The experimental results show that the WAUCE model achieves a higher accuracy with a significantly lower variance for breast cancer diagnosis compared to five other ensemble mechanisms and two common ensemble models, i.e., adaptive boosting and bagging classification tree. The proposed WAUCE model reduces the variance by 97.89% and increases accuracy by 33.34%, compared to the best single SVM model on the SEER dataset. In practice, the proposed methodology can be further applied to other illness diagnoses, which offers an alternative to a safer, more reliable, and more robust illness diagnosis process.

Over the past decade, an emerging trend for combining these approaches with the study of natural products (NPs) has developed in order to manage the challenge of the discovery of bioactive NPs. In the present review, we will introduce the basic principles and protocols for using the ML approach to investigate the bioactivity of NPs, citing a series of practical examples regarding the study of anti-microbial, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory NPs, etc. ML algorithms manage a variety of classification and regression problems associated with bioactive NPs, from those that are linear to non-linear and from pure compounds to plant extracts. Inspired by cases reported in the literature and our own experience, a number of key points have been emphasized for reducing modeling errors, including dataset preparation and applicability domain analysis.

In this context, it becomes an important topic in the data mining field that how to effectively construct an efficient knowledge discovery and mining model. Ensemble learning, as one research hot spot, aims to integrate data fusion, data modeling, and data mining into a unified framework. Specifically, ensemble learning firstly extracts a set of features with a variety of transformations. Based on these learned features, multiple learning algorithms are utilized to produce weak predictive results. Finally, ensemble learning fuses the informative knowledge from the above results obtained to achieve knowledge discovery and better predictive performance via voting schemes in an adaptive way. In this paper, we review the research progress of the mainstream approaches of ensemble learning and classify them based on different characteristics. In addition, we present challenges and possible research directions for each mainstream approach of ensemble learning, and we also give an extra introduction for the combination of ensemble learning with other machine learning hot spots such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.	[Dong, Xibin; Yu, Zhiwen; Shi, Yifan; Ma, Qianli] South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Cao, Wenming] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China		Yu, ZW (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.	zhwyu@scut.edu.cn; wenmincao2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk			National Natural Science Foundation of China [61722205, 61751205, 61572199, 61502174, 61872148, U1611461]; key research and development program of Guangdong province of China [2018B010107002]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2016A050503015, 2017A030313355]; Guangzhou science and technology planning project [201704030051]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); key research and development program of Guangdong province of China; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China; Guangzhou science and technology planning project	The authors are grateful for the constructive advice received from the anonymous reviewers of this paper.

However, reliable and scalable analysis of large imaging datasets in three dimensions remains a challenge. Here we developed a deep learning-based framework to quantify and analyze brain vasculature, named Vessel Segmentation & Analysis Pipeline (VesSAP). Our pipeline uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a transfer learning approach for segmentation and achieves human-level accuracy. By using VesSAP, we analyzed the vascular features of whole C57BL/6J, CD1 and BALB/c mouse brains at the micrometer scale after registering them to the Allen mouse brain atlas. We report evidence of secondary intracranial collateral vascularization in CD1 mice and find reduced vascularization of the brainstem in comparison to the cerebrum. Thus, VesSAP enables unbiased and scalable quantifications of the angioarchitecture of cleared mouse brains and yields biological insights into the vascular function of the brain. VesSAP is a tissue clearing- and deep learning-based pipeline for comprehensively analyzing mouse vasculature, from large vessels to small capillaries.

However, these maps are accepted as end products that can be used for land use planning. The main goal of this study is to assess and compare four advanced machine learning techniques, namely the Bayes' net (BN), radical basis function (RBF) classifier, logisticmodel tree (LMT), and randomforest (RF) models, for landslide susceptibility modelling in Chongren County, China. A total of 222 landslide locations were identified in the study area using historical reports, interpretation of aerial photographs, and extensive field surveys. The landslide inventory data was randomly split into two groups with a ratio of 70/30 for training and validation purposes. Fifteen landslide conditioning factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility modelling. The spatial correlation between landslides and conditioning factors was analyzed using the information gain (IG) method. The BN, RBF classifier, LMT, and RF models were constructed using the training dataset. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and statistical measures, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, were employed to validate and compare the predictive capabilities of the models. Out of the tested models, the RF model had the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values of 0.787, 0.716, and 0.752, respectively, for the training dataset. Overall, the RF model produced an optimized balance for the training and validation datasets in terms of AUC values and statistical measures. The results of this study also demonstrate the benefit of selecting optimal machine learning techniques with proper conditioning selection methods for landslide susceptibility modelling.

DP-GEN: A concurrent learning platform for the generation of reliable deep learning based potential energy models	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Many-body potential energy; Deep learning; Concurrent learning	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS	In recent years, promising deep learning based interatomic potential energy surface (PES) models have been proposed that can potentially allow us to perform molecular dynamics simulations for large scale systems with quantum accuracy. However, making these models truly reliable and practically useful is still a very non-trivial task. A key component in this task is the generation of datasets used in model training. In this paper, we introduce the Deep Potential GENerator (DP-GEN), an open-source software platform that implements the recently proposed "on-the-fly" learning procedure (Zhang et al. 2019) and is capable of generating uniformly accurate deep learning based PES models in a way that minimizes human intervention and the computational cost for data generation and model training. DP-GEN automatically and iteratively performs three steps: exploration, labeling, and training. It supports various popular packages for these three steps: LAMMPS for exploration, Quantum Espresso, VASP, CP2K, etc. for labeling, and DeePMD-kit for training. It also allows automatic job submission and result collection on different types of machines, such as high performance clusters and cloud machines, and is adaptive to different job management tools, including Slurm, PBS, and LSF. As a concrete example, we illustrate the details of the process for generating a general-purpose PES model for Cu using DP-GEN.

However, it already represents 17% of the National Interconnected System. Due to the high level of uncertainty and fluctuations in wind speed, predicting wind energy with high accuracy is challenging. In this context, this paper proposes a novel decomposition-ensemble learning approach that combines Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) and Stacking-ensemble learning (STACK) based on Machine Learning algorithms to forecast the wind energy of a turbine in a wind farm at Parazinho city, Brazil, using multi-step ahead forecasting strategy. The approached forecasting models were k-Nearest Neighbors, Partial Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Cubist Regression. Additionally, Box-Cox transformation, correlation matrix, and principal component analysis were used to pre-process the data. The performance of the proposed forecasting models was evaluated by using three performance metrics: mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error, and the Diebold-Mariano statistical test to evaluate the forecasting error signals. The proposed models outperform the CEEMD, STACK, and single models in all forecasting horizons, with a performance improvement that ranges 0.06%-97.53%. Indeed, the decomposition-ensemble learning model is an efficient and accurate model for wind energy forecasting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They have been applied to solve a variety of real-world problems in science and engineering. Bayesian approximation and ensemble learning techniques are two widely-used types of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. In this regard, researchers have proposed different UQ methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as computer vision (e.g., self driving cars and object detection), image processing (e.g., image restoration), medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation), natural language processing (e.g., text classification, social media texts and recidivism risk-scoring), bioinformatics, etc. This study reviews recent advances in UQ methods used in deep learning, investigates the application of these methods in reinforcement learning, and highlights fundamental research challenges and directions associated with UQ.

J	Zhao, HL; Liu, ZH; Yao, XM; Yang, Q				Zhao, Huiliang; Liu, Zhenghong; Yao, Xuemei; Yang, Qin			A machine learning-based sentiment analysis of online product reviews with a novel term weighting and feature selection approach	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Sentiment analysis; Polarity classification; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis of online product reviews; Term weighting; Elman Neural Network (ENN); Bat algorithm (BA)	TWITTER DATA; EXTRACTION; RANKING	Recently, online shopping has turned into a mainstream means for users to purchase as well as consume with the upsurge development of Internet technology. User satisfaction can be improved effectively by doing Sentiment Analysis (SA) of a large quantity of user reviews on e-commerce platforms. It is still challenging to envisage the accurate sentiment polarities of the user reviews because of the changes in sequence length, textual order, along with complicated logic. This paper proposes a new optimized Machine Learning (ML) algorithm called the Local Search Improvised Bat Algorithm based Elman Neural Network (LSIBA-ENN) for the SA of online product reviews. The proposed work of SA encompasses '4' major steps: i) Data Collection (DC), ii) preprocessing, iii) Features Extraction (FE) or Term Weighting (TW), Feature Selection (FS), and polarity or Sentiment Classifications (SC). Initially, the Web Scrapping Tool (WST) is utilized to extract the customer reviews of the products for which the data is gathered as of the E-commerce websites. Next, preprocessing is carried out on the web scrap extracted data. Those preprocessed data go through TW and FS for additional processing by means of Log Term Frequency-based Modified Inverse Class Frequency (LTF-MICF) and Hybrid Mutation based Earth Warm Algorithm (HMEWA). Lastly, the HM-EWA data is rendered to the LSIBA-ENN, which classifies the customer reviews' sentiment as positive, negative, and neutral. For the performance analysis of the proposed and prevailing classifiers, '2' yardstick datasets are taken. The outcomes exhibit that the LSIBA-ENN attains the best performance in SC when weighted against the existing top-notch algorithms. The observations of the reviewer are exact. The prevailing ENN proffers recall of 87.79 when utilizing the proposed LTF-MICF scheme, whereas ENN only achieve 83.55, 84.03, 85.48, and 86.04 of recall whilst utilizing W2V, TF, TF-IDF, and TF-DFS schemes respectively.

This review asks the question: How can a classifier learn from a source domain and generalize to a target domain? We present a categorization of approaches, divided into, what we refer to as, sample-based, feature-based, and inference-based methods. Sample-based methods focus on weighting individual observations during training based on their importance to the target domain. Feature-based methods revolve around on mapping, projecting, and representing features such that a source classifier performs well on the target domain and inference-based methods incorporate adaptation into the parameter estimation procedure, for instance through constraints on the optimization procedure. Additionally, we review a number of conditions that allow for formulating bounds on the cross-domain generalization error. Our categorization highlights recurring ideas and raises questions important to further research.

Due to the complex nonlinear correlations among environmental factors, traditional machine learning (ML) models have unsatisfactory LSP accuracies. In this letter, a sparse feature extraction network (SFE+) is proposed for LSP. First, the landslides and environmental factors are collected, and frequency ratios of environmental factors are calculated as the model inputs. Second, the input data are passed through the input layer with the dropout, and then, the features are passed through the hidden layers, that is, the k% lifetime sparsity layers. The hidden layers are employed to further sparse these factors to obtain the independent and redundant prediction features as much as possible. Finally, certain classifiers are used to realize the LSP in the study area. SFE-support vector machine (SVM), SFE-logistic regression (LR), and SFE-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models are built. For comparison, principal component analysis (PCA)-SVM, PCA-LR, PCA-SGD, SVM, LR, and SGD models are also built for LSP in Shicheng County, China. Results show that the SFE-based ML models, especially the SFE-SVM, can effectively extract the sparse nonlinear features of environmental factors to improve LSP accuracies and have promising prospects for LSP.

A State-of-the-Art Survey on Deep Learning Theory and Architectures	ELECTRONICS			English	Review						deep learning; convolutional neural network (CNN); recurrent neural network (RNN); auto-encoder (AE); restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM); deep belief network (DBN); generative adversarial network (GAN); deep reinforcement learning (DRL); transfer learning	NETWORK; REPRESENTATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHM	In recent years, deep learning has garnered tremendous success in a variety of application domains. This new field of machine learning has been growing rapidly and has been applied to most traditional application domains, as well as some new areas that present more opportunities. Different methods have been proposed based on different categories of learning, including supervised, semi-supervised, and un-supervised learning. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance using deep learning when compared to traditional machine learning approaches in the fields of image processing, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, art, medical imaging, medical information processing, robotics and control, bioinformatics, natural language processing, cybersecurity, and many others. This survey presents a brief survey on the advances that have occurred in the area of Deep Learning (DL), starting with the Deep Neural Network (DNN). The survey goes on to cover Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Auto-Encoder (AE), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Additionally, we have discussed recent developments, such as advanced variant DL techniques based on these DL approaches. This work considers most of the papers published after 2012 from when the history of deep learning began. Furthermore, DL approaches that have been explored and evaluated in different application domains are also included in this survey. We also included recently developed frameworks, SDKs, and benchmark datasets that are used for implementing and evaluating deep learning approaches. There are some surveys that have been published on DL using neural networks and a survey on Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, those papers have not discussed individual advanced techniques for training large-scale deep learning models and the recently developed method of generative models.

However, advances made via 3DP have been slow due to the lengthy trialand-error approach in optimization. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that could revolutionize pharmaceutical 3DP through analyzing large datasets. Herein, literature-mined data for developing AI machine learning (ML) models was used to predict key aspects of the 3DP formulation pipeline and in vitro dissolution properties. A total of 968 formulations were mined and assessed from 114 articles. The ML techniques explored were able to learn and provide accuracies as high as 93% for values in the filament hot melt extrusion process. In addition, ML algorithms were able to use data from the composition of the formulations with additional input features to predict the drug release of 3D printed medicines. The best prediction was obtained by an artificial neural network that was able to predict drug release times of a formulation with a mean error of +/- 24.29 min. In addition, the most important variables were revealed, which could be leveraged in formulation development. Thus, it was concluded that ML proved to be a suitable approach to modelling the 3D printing workflow.

J	O'Gorman, PA; Dwyer, JG				O'Gorman, Paul A.; Dwyer, John G.			Using Machine Learning to Parameterize Moist Convection: Potential for Modeling of Climate, Climate Change, and Extreme Events	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC GENERAL-CIRCULATION; NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH; CLOUD PARAMETERIZATION; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; STATIC STABILITY; WIDE-RANGE; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; ENSEMBLE; ROBUST	The parameterization of moist convection contributes to uncertainty in climate modeling and numerical weather prediction. Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and nonnegativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large-scale environment. Plain Language Summary Small-scale features such as clouds are typically represented in climate models by simplified physical models, and these simplified models introduce errors and uncertainties. A promising alternative approach is to use machine learning to train a statistical model to represent small-scale processes based on output from expensive physics-based models that better represent the small-scale processes. Here we use idealized tests to explore the implications of incorporating a machine-learning model of atmospheric convection in a climate model. We find that such an approach can give accurate simulations of mean climate and heavy rainfall events. The machine-learning model does not work well for global warming if it is only trained on the current climate. However, it does work well for global warming if trained on both the current and warmer climates, and it works surprisingly well if only trained on the warmer climate. We also show that the machine-learning model can be used to better understand the underlying physical processes.

Despite much promising research currently being undertaken, particularly in imaging, the literature as a whole lacks transparency, clear reporting to facilitate replicability, exploration for potential ethical concerns, and clear demonstrations of effectiveness. Among the many reasons why these problems exist, one of the most important (for which we provide a preliminary solution here) is the current lack of best practice guidance specific to machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, we believe that interdisciplinary groups pursuing research and impact projects involving machine learning and artificial intelligence for health would benefit from explicitly addressing a series of questions concerning transparency, reproducibility, ethics, and effectiveness (TREE). The 20 critical questions proposed here provide a framework for research groups to inform the design, conduct, and reporting; for editors and peer reviewers to evaluate contributions to the literature; and for patients, clinicians and policy makers to critically appraise where new findings may deliver patient benefit.

However, in real-world applications, collecting long-term cycling data is a costly and time-consuming process. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a deep learning-based capacity estimation method that incorporates the concepts of transfer learning and ensemble learning. We target the applications where only a relatively small set of training data is available. Transfer learning is a knowledge learning method that leverages the knowledge learned from a source task to improve learning in a related but different target task. Ensemble learning can reduce the risk of choosing a learning algorithm with poor performance by combining prediction results from multiple learning algorithms. In this study, 10-year daily cycling data from eight implantable Li-ion cells is first used as the source dataset to pre-train eight deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models. The learned parameters of the pre-trained DCNN models are then transferred from the source task to the target task, resulting in eight DCNN with transfer learning (DCNN-TL) models, respectively. These DCNN-TL models are then integrated to build an ensemble model called the DCNN with ensemble learning and transfer learning (DCNN-ETL). The effectiveness of the DCNN-ETL model is verified using a target dataset consisting of 20 commercial 18650 Li-ion cells, and the performance of the model on the target dataset is compared with that of five other data-driven methods including random forest regression, Gaussian process regression, DCNN, DCNN-TL, and DCNN-EL. The verification and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed DCNN-ETL method can produce a higher accuracy and robustness than these other data-driven methods in estimating the capacities of the Li-ion cells in the target task.

In the era of big machinery data, data-driven MHMS have achieved remarkable results in the detection of faults after the occurrence of certain failures (diagnosis) and prediction of the future working conditions and the remaining useful life (prognosis). The numerical representation for raw sensory data is the key stone for various successful MHMS. Conventional methods are the labor-extensive as they usually depend on handcrafted features, which require expert knowledge. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods that redefine representation learning from raw data, we propose local feature-based gated recurrent unit (LFGRU) networks. It is a hybrid approach that combines handcrafted feature design with automatic feature learning for machine health monitoring. First, features from windows of input time series are extracted. Then, an enhanced bidirectional GRU network is designed and applied on the generated sequence of local features to learn the representation. A supervised learning layer is finally trained to predict machine condition. Experiments on three machine health monitoring tasks: tool wear prediction, gearbox fault diagnosis, and incipient bearing fault detection verify the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed LFGRU.

The authors' goal was to apply machine learning to arterial pressure waveforms and create an algorithm to predict hypotension. The algorithm detects early alteration in waveforms that can herald the weakening of cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms affecting preload, afterload, and contractility. Methods: The algorithm was developed with two different data sources: (1) a retrospective cohort, used for training, consisting of 1,334 patients' records with 545,959 min of arterial waveform recording and 25,461 episodes of hypotension; and (2) a prospective, local hospital cohort used for external validation, consisting of 204 patients' records with 33,236 min of arterial waveform recording and 1,923 episodes of hypotension. The algorithm relates a large set of features calculated from the high-fidelity arterial pressure waveform to the prediction of an upcoming hypotensive event (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the algorithm's success in predicting hypotension, defined as mean arterial pressure less than 65 mmHg. Results: Using 3,022 individual features per cardiac cycle, the algorithm predicted arterial hypotension with a sensitivity and specificity of 88% (85 to 90%) and 87% (85 to 90%) 15 min before a hypotensive event (area under the curve, 0.95 [0.94 to 0.95]); 89% (87 to 91%) and 90% (87 to 92%) 10 min before (area under the curve, 0.95 [0.95 to 0.96]); 92% (90 to 94%) and 92% (90 to 94%) 5 min before (area under the curve, 0.97 [0.97 to 0.98]). Conclusions: The results demonstrate that a machine-learning algorithm can be trained, with large data sets of high-fidelity arterial waveforms, to predict hypotension in surgical patients' records.

J	Liu, B; Li, CC; Yan, K				Liu, Bin; Li, Chen-Chen; Yan, Ke			DeepSVM-fold: protein fold recognition by combining support vector machines and pairwise sequence similarity scores generated by deep learning networks	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						protein fold recognition; convolutional neural network; long short-term memory; support vector machine; pairwise sequence similarity scores	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; HOMOLOGY DETECTION; INFORMATION; EVOLUTIONARY; PROFILES; FEATURES	Protein fold recognition is critical for studying the structures and functions of proteins. The existing protein fold recognition approaches failed to efficiently calculate the pairwise sequence similarity scores of the proteins in the same fold sharing low sequence similarities. Furthermore, the existing feature vectorization strategies are not able to measure the global relationships among proteins from different protein folds. In this article, we proposed a new computational predictor called DeepSVM-fold for protein fold recognition by introducing a new feature vector based on the pairwise sequence similarity scores calculated from the fold-specific features extracted by deep learning networks. The feature vectors are then fed into a support vector machine to construct the predictor. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset (LE) show that DeepSVM-fold obviously outperforms all the other competing methods.

In this paper, we give an overview of MTL by first giving a definition of MTL. Then several different settings of MTL are introduced, including multi-task supervised learning, multi-task unsupervised learning, multi-task semi-supervised learning, multi-task active learning, multi-task reinforcement learning, multi-task online learning and multi-task multi-view learning. For each setting, representative MTL models are presented. In order to speed up the learning process, parallel and distributed MTL models are introduced. Many areas, including computer vision, bioinformatics, health informatics, speech, natural language processing, web applications and ubiquitous computing, use MTL to improve the performance of the applications involved and some representative works are reviewed. Finally, recent theoretical analyses for MTL are presented.

J	Mousavi, SM; Beroza, GC				Mousavi, S. Mostafa; Beroza, Gregory C.			A Machine-Learning Approach for Earthquake Magnitude Estimation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							QUANTIFICATION; SCALE; NOISE; DEEP	In this study, we present a fast and reliable method for end-to-end estimation of earthquake magnitude from raw waveforms recorded at single stations. We design a regressor (MagNet) composed of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that is not sensitive to the data normalization, hence waveform amplitude information can be utilized during the training. The network can learn distance-dependent and site-dependent functions directly from the training data. Our model can predict local magnitudes with an average error close to zero and standard deviation of similar to 0.2 based on single-station waveforms without instrument response correction. We test the network for both local and duration magnitude scales and show a station-based learning can be an effective approach for improving the performance. The proposed approach has a variety of potential applications from routine earthquake monitoring to early warning systems.	[Mousavi, S.

J	Shi, H; Xu, MH; Li, R				Shi, Heng; Xu, Minghao; Li, Ran			Deep Learning for Household Load Forecasting-A Novel Pooling Deep RNN	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Big data; deep learning; load forecasting; long short-term memory; machine learning; neural network; smart meter	SMART-METER DATA; LEVEL; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; ACCURACY; NETWORKS; CURVES	The key challenge for household load forecasting lies in the high volatility and uncertainty of load profiles. Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland. Compared with the state-of-the-art techniques in household load tore casting, the proposed method outperforms ARIMA by 19.5%, SVR by 13.1% and classical deep RNN by 6.5% in terms of RMSE.

Role of biological Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques in Detecting and Diagnosing the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Systematic Review	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Review						Coronaviruses; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Artificial Intelligence; Biological Data Mining; Machine Learning		Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that are common in many animal species, including camels, cattle, cats and bats. Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called 'COVID-19', as a 'public health emergency of international concern'. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements. The growing emphasis on data mining and ML techniques in medical fields can provide the right environment for change and improvement.	[Zaidan, A. A.; Zaidan, B. B.; Albahri, A. O. S.; AlAmoodi, A.

M.; Mirjalili, Seyedali			Improved Salp Swarm Algorithm based on opposition based learning and novel local search algorithm for feature selection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Salp Swarm Algorithm; Classification; Feature selection; Optimization; Machine Learning; Algorithm; Opposition Based Learning	INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM; INTEGRATING FEATURE-SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; GENETIC-ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORK	Many fields such as data science, data mining suffered from the rapid growth of data volume and high data dimensionality. The main problems which are faced by these fields include the high computational cost, memory cost, and low accuracy performance. These problems will occur because these fields are mainly used machine learning classifiers. However, machine learning accuracy is affected by the noisy and irrelevant features. In addition, the computational and memory cost of the machine learning is mainly affected by the size of the used datasets. Thus, to solve these problems, feature selection can be used to select optimal subset of features and reduce the data dimensionality. Feature selection represents an important preprocessing step in many intelligent and expert systems such as intrusion detection, disease prediction, and sentiment analysis. An improved version of Salp Swarm Algorithm (ISSA) is proposed in this study to solve feature selection problems and select the optimal subset of features in wrapper-mode. Two main improvements were included into the original SSA algorithm to alleviate its drawbacks and adapt it for feature selection problems. The first improvement includes the use of Opposition Based Learning (OBL) at initialization phase of SSA to improve its population diversity in the search space. The second improvement includes the development and use of new Local Search Algorithm with SSA to improve its exploitation. To confirm and validate the performance of the proposed improved SSA (ISSA), ISSA was applied on 18 datasets from UCI repository. In addition, ISSA was compared with four well-known optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm, and Ant Lion Optimizer. In these experiments four different assessment criteria were used. The rdemonstrate that ISSA outperforms all baseline algorithms in terms of fitness values, accuracy, convergence curves, and feature reduction in most of the used datasets. The wrapper feature selection mode can be used in different application areas of expert and intelligent systems and this is confirmed from the obtained results over different types of datasets.

The method introduces a modified version of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model for identification purposes. The modification is based on proposing and designing a new improved metaheuristic, called the developed Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (dAOA). The algorithm is then verified by various algorithms to demonstrate its effectiveness and is then employed for optimizing the ELM configuration with the aim of minimizing the sum of the square error between the output voltage of the real PEMFC data and the output voltage achieved by the network. Simulation results of the proposed system are validated based on four scenarios that their results are as follows: for 3/5bar with 353.15 K, the maximum training error for dAOA and AOA are 6.01 and 9.899, respectively. For 1/1bar with 343.15 K, the maximum training error for dAOA and AOA are 0.0045 and 0.012, respectively. For 2.5/3bar with 343.15 K, the maximum training error for dAOA and AOA are 0.0132 and 0.0177, respectively, and for 1.5/1.5 bar with 343.15 K, the maximum training error for dAOA and AOA are 0.01and 0.01584, respectively. This shows the better results of the proposed dAOA to provide accurate parameters of the PEMFC stack system. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Renewable energy resources are one possibility to mitigate the dependence of residential buildings on the electrical grid. However, their integration into the existing grid infrastructure must be done carefully to avoid instability, and guarantee availability and security of supply. Demand response, or demand-side management, improves grid stability by increasing demand flexibility, and shifts peak demand towards periods of peak renewable energy generation by providing consumers with economic incentives. This paper reviews the use of reinforcement learning, a machine learning algorithm, for demand response applications in the smart grid. Reinforcement learning has been utilized to control diverse energy systems such as electric vehicles, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, smart appliances, or batteries. The future of demand response greatly depends on its ability to prevent consumer discomfort and integrate human feedback into the control loop. Reinforcement learning is a potentially model-free algorithm that can adapt to its environment, as well as to human preferences by directly integrating user feedback into its control logic. Our review shows that, although many papers consider human comfort and satisfaction, most of them focus on single-agent systems with demand-independent electricity prices and a stationary environment. However, when electricity prices are modelled as demand-dependent variables, there is a risk of shifting the peak demand rather than shaving it. We identify a need to further explore reinforcement learning to coordinate multi-agent systems that can participate in demand response programs under demand-dependent electricity prices. Finally, we discuss directions for future research, e.g., quantifying how RL could adapt to changing urban conditions such as building refurbishment and urban or population growth.

Human emotion is the basic component of human cognitive activities. Electroencephalogram (EEG) computer signals obtained from a brain computer interface are difficult to conceal, and using machine learning methods to analyze EEG emotion is a hot topic in artificial intelligence. However, the EEG signal is non-stationary, making it difficult to select sufficient data from the same person to train a classifier for a subject. To promote the performance of emotion recognition methods, a multi-source domain transfer discriminative dictionary learning modeling (MDTDDL) is proposed in this study. The method integrates transfer learning and dictionary learning in a learning model, including the concepts of subspace learning, manifold smoothness, margin-based discriminant embedding, and large margin. The domain-specific transformation matrix projects EEG signals from various domains into the transfer subspace. The domain-invariant dictionary can find potential connections between multiple source domains and target domain. The manifold smoothness and margin-based discriminant embedding term further improve the model's learning ability. The alternating optimization technique is used in model solving to efficiently compute model parameters. Experiments on the SEED and DEAP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MDTDDL.

Rapid accumulation of sequences requires equally pervasive development of new predictive models, which depends on the availability of effective tools that support these efforts. We introduce iLearnPlus, the first machine-learning platform with graphical- and web-based interfaces for the construction of machine-learning pipelines for analysis and predictions using nucleic acid and protein sequences. iLearnPlus provides a comprehensive set of algorithms and automates sequence-based feature extraction and analysis, construction and deployment of models, assessment of predictive performance, statistical analysis, and data visualization; all without programming. iLearnPlus includes a wide range of feature sets which encode information from the input sequences and over twenty machine-learning algorithms that cover several deep-learning approaches, outnumbering the current solutions by a wide margin. Our solution caters to experienced bioinformaticians, given the broad range of options, and biologists with no programming background, given the point-and-click interface and easy-to-follow design process. We showcase iLearnPlus with two case studies concerning prediction of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) from RNA transcripts and prediction of crotonylation sites in protein chains. iLearnPlus is an open-source platform available at https://github.com/Superzchen/iLearnPlus/ with the webserver at http://ilearnplus.erc.monash.edu/.

Long short-term memory for machine remaining life prediction	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Prognostics; Health index; Deep learning; Remaining useful life	PROGNOSTICS; STATE	Reliable tracking of performance degradation in dynamical systems such as manufacturing machines or aircraft engines and consequently, prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) are one of the major challenges in realizing smart manufacturing. Traditional machine learning algorithms are often constrained in adapting to the complex and non-linear characteristics of manufacturing systems and processes. With the rapid development of modern computational hardware, Deep Learning has emerged as a promising computational technique for dynamical system prediction due to its enhanced capability to characterize the system complexity, overcoming the shortcomings of those traditional methods. In this paper, a new approach based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, an architecture that is specialized in discovering the underlying patterns embedded in time series, is proposed to track the system degradation and consequently, to predict the RUL. The objectives of this paper are; 1) translating the raw sensor data to an interpretable health index with the aim of better describing the system health condition; and 2) tracking the historical system degradation for accurate prediction of its future health condition. Evaluation using NASA's C-MAPSS dataset verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with other machine learning techniques, LSTM turns out to be more powerful and accurate in revealing degradation patterns, enabled by its time-dependent structure in nature.

Prediction models that combine several features to estimate the risk of infection have been developed. These aim to assist medical staff worldwide in triaging patients, especially in the context of limited healthcare resources. We established a machine-learning approach that trained on records from 51,831 tested individuals (of whom 4769 were confirmed to have COVID-19). The test set contained data from the subsequent week (47,401 tested individuals of whom 3624 were confirmed to have COVID-19). Our model predicted COVID-19 test results with high accuracy using only eight binary features: sex, age >= 60 years, known contact with an infected individual, and the appearance of five initial clinical symptoms. Overall, based on the nationwide data publicly reported by the Israeli Ministry of Health, we developed a model that detects COVID-19 cases by simple features accessed by asking basic questions. Our framework can be used, among other considerations, to prioritize testing for COVID-19 when testing resources are limited.

The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, typical meta-learning models use shallow neural networks, thus limiting its effectiveness. In order to achieve top performance, some recent works tried to use the DNNs pre-trained on large-scale datasets but mostly in straight-forward manners, e.g., (1) taking their weights as a warm start of meta-training, and (2) freezing their convolutional layers as the feature extractor of base-learners. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called meta-transfer learning (MTL), which learns to transfer the weights of a deep NN for few-shot learning tasks. Specifically, meta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights (and biases) for each task. To further boost the learning efficiency of MTL, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum of few-shot classification tasks. We conduct experiments for five-class few-shot classification tasks on three challenging benchmarks, miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and Fewshot-CIFAR100 (FC100), in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our MTL approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both components contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.

Generalizing from a Few Examples: A Survey on Few-shot Learning	ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS			English	Article						Few-shot learning; one-shot learning; low-shot learning; small sample learning; meta-learning; prior knowledge	OPTIMIZATION	Machine learning has been highly successful in data-intensive applications but is often hampered when the data set is small. Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSI we distinguish PSI, from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.

However, the general composition and functional profiles of bacterial community in soils which suppress multiple diseases for various plants remain largely unknown. Here, we combined metadata analysis with machine learning to identify the general patterns of bacterial-community composition in disease-suppressive soils. Disease-suppressive soils significantly enriched Firmicutes and Actinobacteria but showed a decrease in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Our machine-learning models accurately identified the disease-conducive and -suppressive soils with 54 biomarker genera, 28 of which were potentially beneficial. We further carried out a successive passaging experiment with the susceptible rps2 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana invaded by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (avrRpt2) for functional verification of potential beneficial bacteria. The disease-suppressive ability of Kribbella, Nocardioides and Bacillus was confirmed, and they positively activated the pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity pathway. Results also showed that chemical control by pesticides in agricultural production decreased the disease-suppressive ability of soil. This study provides a method for accurately predicting the occurrence of multiple diseases in soil and identified potential beneficial bacteria to guide a wide range of multiple-strain biological control strategies in agricultural management.

Although there are established screening methods - fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography for detection of the disease but in majority of the cases, the patients remain ignorant and fail to undertake such tests at an appropriate time. The early detection of the disease plays an extremely important role in preventing vision loss which is the consequence of diabetes mellitus remaining untreated among patients for a prolonged time period. Various machine learning and deep learning approaches have been implemented on diabetic retinopathy dataset for classification and prediction of the disease but majority of them have neglected the aspect of data pre-processing and dimensionality reduction, leading to biased results. The dataset used in the present study is a diabetes retinopathy dataset collected from the UCI machine learning repository. At its inceptions, the raw dataset is normalized using the Standardscalar technique and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the most significant features in the dataset. Further, Firefly algorithm is implemented for dimensionality reduction. This reduced dataset is fed into a Deep Neural Network Model for classification. The results generated from the model is evaluated against the prevalent machine learning models and the results justify the superiority of the proposed model in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity and Specificity.

However, it is little reported for CAD. This study therefore aimed to screen an optimal classier model of CAD with liver metastasis and explore the metastatic mechanisms of genes when applying this classier model. Methods The differentially expressed genes between primary CAD samples and CAD with metastasis samples were screened from the Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) dataset . The classification performances of six selected algorithms, namely, LR, RF, SVM, GBDT, NN, and CatBoost, for classification of CAD with liver metastasis samples were compared using the MCC dataset by detecting their classification test accuracy. In addition, the consortium datasets of and were used as internal and external validation sets to screen the optimal method. Subsequently, functional analyses and a drug-targeted network construction of the feature genes when applying the optimal method were conducted. Results The optimal CatBoost model with the highest accuracy of 99%, and an area under the curve of 1, was screened, which consisted of 33 feature genes. A functional analysis showed that the feature genes were closely associated with a "steroid metabolic process" and "lipoprotein particle receptor binding" (eg APOB and APOC3). In addition, the feature genes were significantly enriched in the "complement and coagulation cascade" pathways (eg FGA, F2, and F9). In a drug-target interaction network, F2 and F9 were predicted as targets of menadione. Conclusion The CatBoost model constructed using 33 feature genes showed the optimal classification performance for identifying CAD with liver metastasis.

The meta-combined brand equity analysis is based on two main research perspectives: financial perspective and customer perspective. While the financial perspective is based on the incremental discounted future cash flows that would result from a branded product's revenue over the revenue of an unbranded product, the brand equity from the customer's perspective is the consumer's reaction to brand marketing behavior, the impact on brand knowledge. The decision-making of marketing behaviors often faces choices related to ethics. Therefore, once the moral value of a company through marketing behavior is recognized by consumers, the ethical behavior presented in this article through marketing behavior will make consumers feel more about the brand. How does the brand equity of your customer's products affect you? In this experiment, shopping groups with the same shopping experience were selected. During the survey process, all customers in different periods and the same time were selected as far as possible based on the practicability of the survey. The study survey covered 4 main aspects; customer satisfaction, overall overview of customer satisfaction; the advantages and disadvantages of marketing strategies through quantitative analysis and to put forward reasonable marketing strategy improvement opinions and suggestions to improve customer satisfaction. Using the technique of parameter prediction of the financial industry, the experiment proved that the non-standard promotion behavior, the integrity of the enterprise and the social responsibility are three aspects (P<0.05) that have an impact on the customer's brand equity among the corporate marketing components. It was a detailed study of the current state of brand marketing strategies and customer satisfaction, found key indicators of brands that could improve customer satisfaction, and presented corresponding suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies. It shows that. It has the importance of good guidance and references to improve customer satisfaction in the industry.

The micromechanical model was developed based on the rule of mixture and grain and grain boundary sizes evolution to predict the elastic modulus of the produced nanocomposites. Then, a FE model was developed to simulate the microindentation test. The input for the FE model was the elastic modulus that was computed using the micromechanics model and wide range of yield and tangent stresses values. Finally, the output load-displacement response from the FE model, the elastic modulus, the yield and tangent strengths used for the FE simulations, and the residual indentation depth were used to train the machine learning model (Random vector functional link network) for the prediction of the yield and tangent stresses of the produced nanocomposites. Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposites with different Al2O3 concentration were manufactured using insitu chemical method to validate the proposed model. After training the model, the microindentation experimental load-displacement curve for Cu-Al2O3 nanocomposites was fed to the machine learning model and the mechanical properties were obtained. The obtained mechanical properties were in very good agreement with the experimental ones achieving 0.99 coefficient of determination R2 for the yield strength.	[Najjar, I. M. R.; Sadoun, A.

This popularity has led to a rapid raise of Android malware in recent years. The sophistication of Android malware obfuscation and detection avoidance methods have significantly improved, making many traditional malware detection methods obsolete. In this paper, we propose DL-Droid, a deep learning system to detect malicious Android applications through dynamic analysis using stateful input generation. Experiments performed with over 30,000 applications (benign and malware) on real devices are presented. Furthermore, experiments were also conducted to compare the detection performance and code coverage of the stateful input generation method with the commonly used stateless approach using the deep learning system. Our study reveals that DL-Droid can achieve up to 97.8% detection rate (with dynamic features only) and 99.6% detection rate (with dynamic + static features) respectively which outperforms traditional machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the results highlight the significance of enhanced input generation for dynamic analysis as DL-Droid with the state-based input generation is shown to outperform the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

With the advances in electronic and information technologies, machine vision combined with image processing techniques has become a promising tool for precise real-time weed and crop detection in the field, providing valuable sensing information for site-specific weed management. This review summarized the advances of weed detection using ground-based machine vision and image processing techniques. Concretely, the four procedures, i.e., pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification, for weed detection were presented in detail. To separate vegetation from background, different color indices and classification approaches like color index-based, threshold-based and learning-based ones, were developed. The difficulty of weed detection lies in discriminating between crops and weeds that often have similar properties. Generally, four categories of features, i.e., biological morphology, spectral features, visual textures and spatial contexts, were used for the task, which were discussed in this review. Application of conventional machine learning-based and recently developed deep learning-based approaches for weed detection were also presented. Finally, challenges and solutions provided by researchers for weed detection in the field, including occlusion and overlap of leaves, varying lighting conditions and different growth stages, were discussed.

In this letter, a high-resolution machine learning (ML) method for detecting inland water content using the CYGNSS data is implemented via the random undersampling boosted (RUSBoost) algorithm. The CYGNSS data of the year 2018 over the Congo and Amazon basins are gridded into cells. The RUSBoost-based classifier is trained and tested with the CYGNSS data over the Congo basin. The data of the Amazon basin that is unknown to the classifier are then used for further evaluation. By only using the observables extracted from the CYGNSS data, the proposed technique is able to detect 95.4x0025; and 93.3x0025; of the water bodies over the Congo and Amazon basins, respectively. The performance of the RUSBoost-based classifier is also compared with an image processing-based inland water detection method. For the Congo and Amazon basins, the RUSBoost-based classifier has a 3.9x0025; and 14.2x0025; higher water detection accuracy, respectively.

An emerging model, called federated learning (FL), is rising above both centralized systems and on-site analysis, to be a new fashioned design for ML implementation. It is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach, which keeps raw data on devices and involves local ML training while eliminating data communication overhead. A federation of the learned and shared models is then performed on a central server to aggregate and share the built knowledge among participants. This article starts by examining and comparing different ML-based deployment architectures, followed by in-depth and in-breadth investigation on FL. Compared to the existing reviews in the field, we provide in this survey a new classification of FL topics and research fields based on thorough analysis of the main technical challenges and current related work. In this context, we elaborate comprehensive taxonomies covering various challenging aspects, contributions, and trends in the literature, including core system models and designs, application areas, privacy and security, and resource management. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges and open research directions toward more robust FL systems.

Realizing this in practice, though, requires overcoming several challenges. First, the use of narrow beams and the sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockage greatly impact the coverage and reliability of highly-mobile links. Second, highly-mobile users in dense mmWave deployments need to frequently hand-off between base stations (BSs), which is associated with critical control and latency overhead. Furthermore, identifying the optimal beamforming vectors in large antenna array mmWave systems requires considerable training overhead, which significantly affects the efficiency of these mobile systems. In this paper, a novel integrated machine learning and coordinated beamforming solution is developed to overcome these challenges and enable highly-mobile mmWave applications. In the proposed solution, a number of distributed yet coordinating BSs simultaneously serve a mobile user. This user ideally needs to transmit only one uplink training pilot sequence that will be jointly received at the coordinating BSs using omni or quasi-omni beam patterns. These received signals draw a de fining signature not only for the user location, but also for its interaction with the surrounding environment. The developed solution then leverages a deep learning model that learns how to use these signatures to predict the beamforming vectors at the BSs. This renders a comprehensive solution that supports highly mobile mmWave applications with reliable coverage, low latency, and negligible training overhead. Extensive simulation results based on accurate ray-tracing, show that the proposed deep-learning coordinated beamforming strategy approaches the achievable rate of the genie-aided solution that knows the optimal beamforming vectors with no training overhead. Compared with traditional beamforming solutions, the results show that the proposed deep learning-based strategy attains higher rates, especially in high-mobility large-array regimes.

The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model's internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-ns), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model's effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by E-ns = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61-22.53%) and (8.26-8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.

SVMs are one of the most powerful and robust classification and regression algorithms in multiple fields of application. The SVM has been playing a significant role in pattern recognition which is an extensively popular and active research area among the researchers. Research in some fields where SVMs do not perform well has spurred development of other applications such as SVM for large data sets, SVM for multi classification and SVM for unbalanced data sets. Further, SVM has been integrated with other advanced methods such as evolve algorithms, to enhance the ability of classification and optimize parameters. SVM algorithms have gained recognition in research and applications in several scientific and engineering areas. This paper provides a brief introduction of SVMs, describes many applications and summarizes challenges and trends. Furthermore, limitations of SVMs will be identified. The future of SVMs will be discussed in conjunction with further applications. The applications of SVMs will be reviewed as well, especially in the some fields. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A deep learning based traffic crash severity prediction framework	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Traffic collision; accident severity; Deep learning; Transfer learning; Numeric to image transformation; Customized loss function	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; INJURY SEVERITY; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; MODELS	Highway work zones are most vulnerable roadway segments for congestion and traffic collisions. Hence, providing accurate and timely prediction of the severity of traffic collisions at work zones is vital to reduce the response time for emergency units (e.g., medical aid), accordingly improve traffic safety and reduce congestion. In predicting the severity of traffic collisions, previous studies used different statistical and machine learning models with accuracy as the main evaluating factor. However, the performance of these models was generally not good, especially on fatal and injury crashes. Also, looking into the prediction accuracy only is misleading.& nbsp; This paper aims to propose a novel deep learning-based approach with a customized f1-loss function to predict the severity of traffic crashes. Underlying this objective is to compare the results of deep learning models with machine learning model considering two performance indicators, namely precision, and recall. The data used in the analysis include a sample of traffic crashes that occurred at work zones in Louisiana from 2014 to 2018. This dataset includes valuable information (features) related to road, vehicle, and human factors affecting the occurrence and severity of those crashes.& nbsp; The proposed methodology is based on transforming these features/variables into images. Image transformation is conducted using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE and convex hull algorithm. A CNN based deep learning algorithm with a customized loss function was used to directly optimize the model for precision and recall. The results showed improved performance in predicting the crash severity of fatal and injury crashes using the deep learning approach, which can help to improve traffic safety as well as traffic congestion at work zones and possibly other roadways segments.

Among these machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have drawn attention to image classification in several remote sensing applications. This article reviews RF and SVM concepts relevant to remote sensing image classification and applies a meta-analysis of 251 peer-reviewed journal papers. A database with more than 40 quantitative and qualitative fields was constructed from these reviewed papers. The meta-analysis mainly focuses on 1) the analysis regarding the general characteristics of the studies, such as geographical distribution, frequency of the papers considering time, journals, application domains, and remote sensing software packages used in the case studies, and 2) a comparative analysis regarding the performances of RF and SVM classification against various parameters, such as data type, RS applications, spatial resolution, and the number of extracted features in the feature engineering step. The challenges, recommendations, and potential directions for future research are also discussed in detail. Moreover, a summary of the results is provided to aid researchers to customize their efforts in order to achieve the most accurate results based on their thematic applications.

A number of studies have been recently undertaken to study this process and to predict it over space and ultimately, in a broader national effort, to limit its negative effects on local communities. We focused on the Bastam watershed where 9.3% of its surface is currently affected by gullying. Machine learning algorithms are currently under the magnifying glass across the geomorphological community for their high predictive ability. However, unlike the bivariate statistical models, their structure does not provide intuitive and quantifiable measures of environmental preconditioning factors. To cope with such weakness, we interpret preconditioning causes on the basis of a bivariate approach namely, Index of Entropy. And, we performed the susceptibility mapping procedure by testing three extensions of a decision tree model namely, Alternating Decision Tree (ADTree), Naive-Bayes tree (NBTree), and Logistic Model Tree (LMT). We dichotomized the gully information over space into gully presence/absence conditions, which we further explored in their calibration and validation stages. Being the presence/absence information and associated factors identical, the resulting differences are only due to the algorithmic structures of the three models we chose. Such differences are not significant in terms of performances; in fact, the three models produce outstanding predictive AUC measures (ADTree = 0.922; NBTree = 0.939; LMT = 0.944). However, the associated mapping results depict very different patterns where only the LMT is associated with reasonable susceptibility patterns. This is a strong indication of what model combines best performance and mapping for any natural hazard - oriented application.

Here the authors developed a machine learning-based integrative procedure to construct a consensus immune-related lncRNA signature to predict prognosis, recurrence and treatment benefits in colorectal cancer. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are recently implicated in modifying immunology in colorectal cancer (CRC). Nevertheless, the clinical significance of immune-related lncRNAs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we develope a machine learning-based integrative procedure for constructing a consensus immune-related lncRNA signature (IRLS). IRLS is an independent risk factor for overall survival and displays stable and powerful performance, but only demonstrates limited predictive value for relapse-free survival. Additionally, IRLS possesses distinctly superior accuracy than traditional clinical variables, molecular features, and 109 published signatures. Besides, the high-risk group is sensitive to fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, while the low-risk group benefits more from bevacizumab. Notably, the low-risk group displays abundant lymphocyte infiltration, high expression of CD8A and PD-L1, and a response to pembrolizumab. Taken together, IRLS could serve as a robust and promising tool to improve clinical outcomes for individual CRC patients.

For this purpose, firstly ETo data were estimated using meteorological data and the FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) method. Then, ETo modeling by six machine learning techniques including multiple linear regression (MLR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), model tree M5 (M5), random forest (RF) and least-squares boost (LSBoost) was carried out. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method was used under seven scenarios to rank models with evaluation and time criteria in the next step. After proving the acceptable performance of the LSBoost model, the downscaling of temperature (T) and precipitation (P) by the delta change factor (CF) method under three models ACCESS-ESM1-5, CanESM5 and MRI-ESM2-0 (scenarios SSP245-cov-fossil (SCF), SSP245-cov-modgreen (SCM) and SSP245-cov-strgreen (SCS)) was performed. The results showed that the monthly changes in the average T increases at all stations for all scenarios. Also, the average monthly change ratio of P increases in most stations and scenarios. In the next step, ETo forecasting under climate change for periods (2021-2050) was performed using the best model. Prediction results showed that ETo increases in all scenarios and stations in a pessimistic and optimistic state. In addition, the Monte Carlo method (MCM) showed that the lowest uncertainty is related to the Mianeh station in the MRI-ESM2-0 model and SCS scenario.

Satellite remote sensing measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were statistically associated with in-situ observations after 2013 to predict PM2.5 concentrations nationwide, while the lack of surface monitoring data before 2013 have created difficulties in historical PM2.5 exposure estimates. Hindcast approaches using statistical models or chemical transport models (CTMs) were developed to overcome this limitation, while those approaches still suffer from incomplete daily coverage due to missing AOD data or limited accuracy due to uncertainties of CTMs. Here we developed a new machine learning (ML) model with high-dimensional expansion (HD-expansion) of numerous predictors (including AOD and other satellite covariates, meteorological variables and CTM simulations). Through comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear effects of, and interactions among different predictors, the HD-expansion parameterized the association between PM2.5 and AOD as a nonlinear function of space and time covariates (e.g., planetary boundary layer height and relative humidity). In this way, the PM2.5-AOD association can vary spatiotemporally. We trained the model with data from 2013 to 2016 and evaluated its performance using annually-iterated cross-validation, which iteratively held out the in-situ observations for a whole calendar year (as testing data) to examine the predictions from a model trained by the rest of the observations. Our estimates were found to be in good agreement with in-situ observations, with correlation coefficients (R-2) of 0.61, 0.68, and 0.75 for daily, monthly and annual averages, respectively. To interpolate the missing predictions due to incomplete AOD data, we incorporated a generalized additive model into the ML model. The two-stage estimates of PM2.5 sacrificed the prediction accuracy on a daily timescale (R-2 = 0.55), but achieved complete spatiotemporal coverage and improved the accuracy of monthly (R-2 = 0.71) and annual (R-2 = 0.77) averages. The model was then used to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations during 2000-2016 across China and estimate long-term trends in PM2.5 for the period. We found that population-weighted concentrations of PM2.5 significantly increased, by 2.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.74, 2.46) mu g/m(3)/year during 2000-2007, and rapidly decreased by 4.51 (3.12, 5.90) mu g/m(3)/year during 2013-2016. In this study, we produced AOD-based estimates of historical PM2.5 with complete spatiotemporal coverage, which were evidenced as accurate, particularly in middle and long term. The products could support large-scale epidemiological studies and risk assessments of ambient PM2.5 in China.

While AM has many advantages over subtractive manufacturing processes, one of the primary limitations of AM is surface integrity. To improve the surface integrity of additively manufactured parts, a data-driven predictive modeling approach to predicting surface roughness in AM is introduced. Multiple sensors of different types, including thermocouples, infrared temperature sensors, and accelerometers, are used to collect temperature and vibration data. An ensemble learning algorithm is introduced to train the predictive model of surface roughness. Features in the time and frequency domains are extracted from sensor-based condition monitoring data. A subset of these features is selected to improve computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. The predictive model is validated using the condition monitoring data collected from a set of AM tests conducted on a fused filament fabrication (FFF) machine. Experimental results have shown that the proposed predictive modeling approach is capable of predicting the surface roughness of 3D printed components with high accuracy.

This growing interest, started in the last decades, might be explained by the multitude of potential applications that could use the results of this research field, e.g. robotics, entertainment, surveillance, care for the elderly and disabled, and content-based indexing. In this survey paper, vision-based pedestrian detection systems are analysed based on their field of application, acquisition technology, computer vision techniques and classification strategies. Three main application fields have been individuated and discussed: video surveillance, human-machine interaction and analysis. Due to the large variety of acquisition technologies, this paper discusses both the differences between 2D and 3D vision systems, and indoor and outdoor systems. The authors reserved a dedicated section for the analysis of the Deep Learning methodologies, including the Convolutional Neural Networks in pedestrian detection and tracking, considering their recent exploding adoption for such a land systems. Finally, focusing on the classification point of view, different Machine Learning techniques have been analysed, basing the discussion on the classification performances on different benchmark datasets. The reported results highlight the importance of testing pedestrian detection systems on different datasets to evaluate the robustness of the computed groups of features used as input to classifiers.

J	Liu, HW; Hu, B; Chen, L; Lu, L				Liu, Hongwei; Hu, Bin; Chen, Lei; Lu, Lin			Identifying Protein Subcellular Location with Embedding Features Learned from Networks	CURRENT PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Protein subcellular location prediction; network embedding algorithm; deepWalk; Node2vec; mashup; machine learning algorithm; support vector machine; random forest	AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; FUNCTIONAL DOMAIN COMPOSITION; PREDICTION; LOCALIZATION; ALGORITHM	Background: Identification of protein subcellular location is an important problem be-cause the subcellular location is highly related to protein function. It is fundamental to determine the locations with biology experiments. However, these experiments are of high costs and time-con-suming. The alternative way to address such a problem is to design effective computational meth-ods. Objective: To date, several computational methods have been proposed in this regard. However, th-ese methods mainly adopted the features derived from the proteins themselves. On the other hand, with the development of the network technique, several embedding algorithms have been pro-posed, which can encode nodes in the network into feature vectors. Such algorithms connected the network and traditional classification algorithms. Thus, they provided a new way to construct mod -els for the prediction of protein subcellular location. Methods: In this study, we analyzed features produced by three network embedding algorithms (DeepWalk, Node2vec and Mashup) that were applied on one or multiple protein networks. Ob-tained features were learned by one machine learning algorithm (support vector machine or ran-dom forest) to construct the model. The cross-validation method was adopted to evaluate all con-structed models. Results: After evaluating models with the cross-validation method, embedding features yielded by Mashup on multiple networks were quite informative for predicting protein subcellular location. The model based on these features were superior to some classic models. Conclusion: Embedding features yielded by a proper and powerful network embedding algorithm were effective for building the model for prediction of protein subcellular location, providing new pipelines to build more efficient models.

J	Zhu, QM; Liu, ZL; Yan, JH				Zhu, Qiming; Liu, Zeliang; Yan, Jinhui			Machine learning for metal additive manufacturing: predicting temperature and melt pool fluid dynamics using physics-informed neural networks	COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS			English	Article						CFD; Thermal multiphase flows; Additive manufacturing	POWDER-BED FUSION; CONSISTENT CLUSTERING ANALYSIS; ALLOYING ELEMENT VAPORIZATION; SPACE-TIME; TIRE AERODYNAMICS; TURBULENCE MODELS; ROAD CONTACT; FLOW; FRAMEWORK; GEOMETRY	The recent explosion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in the breakthrough of metal additive manufacturing (AM) process modeling, which is an indispensable step to derive the process-structure-property relationship. However, the success of conventional machine learning tools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented large amount of labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or first-principle simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are expensive to obtain in AM due to the high expense of the AM experiments and prohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, hindering the direct applications of big-data based ML tools to metal AM problems. To fully exploit the power of machine learning for metal AM while alleviating the dependence on "big data", we put forth a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that fuses both data and first physical principles, including conservation laws of momentum, mass, and energy, into the neural network to inform the learning processes. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application of physics-informed deep learning to three dimensional AM processes modeling. Besides, we propose a hard-type approach for Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) based on a Heaviside function, which can not only exactly enforce the BCs but also accelerate the learning process. The PINN framework is applied to two representative metal manufacturing problems, including the 2018 NIST AM-Benchmark test series. We carefully assess the performance of the PINN model by comparing the predictions with available experimental data and high-fidelity simulation results, using finite element based variational multi-scale formulation method. The investigations show that the PINN, owed to the additional physical knowledge, can accurately predict the temperature and melt pool dynamics during metal AM processes with only a moderate amount of labeled data-sets. The foray of PINN to metal AM shows the great potential of physics-informed deep learning for broader applications to advanced manufacturing. All the data-sets and the PINN code will be made open-sourced in https://yan.cee.illinois.edu/ once the paper is published.

Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, from an implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an educational tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly, DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging scientific machine learning field.

To address this gap in knowledge, we used machine learning to decipher clinically relevant signatures from immunophenotypic, proteomic, and clinical data and then examined transcriptome changes in the lymphocyte subsets that predicted major posttransplant outcomes. Kinetics of immune subset reconstitution after day 28 were similar for 70 patients undergoing haplo and 75 patients undergoing HLA-matched BMT. Machine learning based on 35 candidate factors (10 clinical, 18 cellular, and 7 proteomic) revealed that combined elevations in effector CD4(+) conventional T cells (Tconv) and CXCL9 at day 28 predicted acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Furthermore, higher NK cell counts predicted improved overall survival (OS) due to a reduction in both nonrelapse mortality and relapse. Transcriptional and flow-cytometric analyses of recovering lymphocytes in patients with aGVHD identified preserved hallmarks of functional CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) while highlighting a Tconv-driven inflammatory and metabolic axis distinct from that seen with conventional GVHD prophylaxis. Patients developing early relapse displayed a loss of inflammatory gene signatures in NK cells and a transcriptional exhaustion phenotype in CD8(+) T cells. Using a multimodality approach, we highlight the utility of systems biology in BMT biomarker discovery and offer a novel understanding of how PTCy influences alloimmune responses. Our work charts future directions for novel therapeutic interventions after these increasingly used GVHD prophylaxis platforms.

Tools to study glycans are rapidly evolving; however, the majority of our knowledge is deeply dependent on binding by glycan binding proteins (e.g., lectins). The specificities of lectins, which are often naturally isolated proteins, have not been well-defined, making it difficult to leverage their full potential for glycan analysis. Herein, we use a combination of machine learning algorithms and expert annotation to define lectin specificity for this important probe set. Our analysis uses comprehensive glycan microarray analysis of commercially available lectins we obtained using version 5.0 of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics glycan microarray (CFGv5). This data set was made public in 2011. We report the creation of this data set and its use in large-scale evaluation of lectin-glycan binding behaviors. Our motif analysis was performed by integrating 68 manually defined glycan features with systematic probing of computational rules for significant binding motifs using mono- and disaccharides and linkages. Combining machine learning with manual annotation, we create a detailed interpretation of glycan-binding specificity for 57 unique lectins, categorized by their major binding motifs: mannose, complex-type N-glycan, O-glycan, fucose, sialic acid and sulfate, GlcNAc and chitin, Gal and LacNAc, and GalNAc. Our work provides fresh insights into the complex binding features of commercially available lectins in current use, providing a critical guide to these important reagents.

Several researches have been reported by mimicking the basilar membrane but still have dimensional drawback due to limitation of controlling a multifrequency band and broadening resonant spectrum for full-cover phonetic frequencies. Here, highly sensitive piezoelectric mobile acoustic sensor (PMAS) is demonstrated by exploiting an ultrathin membrane for biomimetic frequency band control. Simulation results prove that resonant bandwidth of a piezoelectric film can be broadened by adopting a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) membrane on the ultrathin polymer to cover the entire voice spectrum. Machine learning-based biometric authentication is demonstrated by the integrated acoustic sensor module with an algorithm processor and customized Android app. Last, exceptional error rate reduction in speaker identification is achieved by a PMAS module with a small amount of training data, compared to a conventional microelectromechanical system microphone.

Evaluation of global terrestrial evapotranspiration using state-of-the-art approaches in remote sensing, machine learning and land surface modeling	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; PLANT FUNCTIONAL TYPES; ATMOSPHERE WATER FLUX; LATENT-HEAT FLUX; LEAF-AREA INDEX; VEGETATION INDEX; EDDY COVARIANCE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLIMATE MODELS; USE EFFICIENCY	Evapotranspiration (ET) is critical in linking global water, carbon and energy cycles. However, direct measurement of global terrestrial ET is not feasible. Here, we first reviewed the basic theory and state-of-the-art approaches for estimating global terrestrial ET, including remote-sensing-based physical models, machine-learning algorithms and land surface models (LSMs). We then utilized 4 remote-sensing-based physical models, 2 machine-learning algorithms and 14 LSMs to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in global terrestrial ET. The results showed that the ensemble means of annual global terrestrial ET estimated by these three categories of approaches agreed well, with values ranging from 589.6 mm yr(-1) (6.56 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1)) to 617.1 mm yr(-1) (6.87 x 10(4) km(3) yr(-1)). For the period from 1982 to 2011, both the ensembles of remote-sensing-based physical models and machine-learning algorithms suggested increasing trends in global terrestrial ET (0.62 mm yr(-2) with a significance level of p < 0.05 and 0.38 mm yr(-2) with a significance level of p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the ensemble mean of the LSMs showed no statistically significant change (0.23 mm yr(-2), p > 0.05), although many of the individual LSMs reproduced an increasing trend. Nevertheless, all 20 models used in this study showed that anthropogenic Earth greening had a positive role in increasing terrestrial ET. The concurrent small interannual variability, i.e., relative stability, found in all estimates of global terrestrial ET, suggests that a potential planetary boundary exists in regulating global terrestrial ET, with the value of this boundary being around 600mm yr(-1). Uncertainties among approaches were identified in specific regions, particularly in the Amazon Basin and arid/semiarid regions. Improvements in parameterizing water stress and canopy dynamics, the utilization of new available satellite retrievals and deep-learning methods, and model-data fusion will advance our predictive understanding of global terrestrial ET.

It has already made a huge impact in areas, such as cancer diagnosis, precision medicine, self-driving cars, predictive forecasting, and speech recognition. The painstakingly handcrafted feature extractors used in traditional learning, classification, and pattern recognition systems are not scalable for large-sized data sets. In many cases, depending on the problem complexity, DL can also overcome the limitations of earlier shallow networks that prevented efficient training and abstractions of hierarchical representations of multi-dimensional training data. Deep neural network (DNN) uses multiple (deep) layers of units with highly optimized algorithms and architectures. This paper reviews several optimization methods to improve the accuracy of the training and to reduce training time. We delve into the math behind training algorithms used in recent deep networks. We describe current shortcomings, enhancements, and implementations. The review also covers different types of deep architectures, such as deep convolution networks, deep residual networks, recurrent neural networks, reinforcement learning, variational autoencoders, and others.

FL is a new research area often referred to as a new dawn in AI, is in its infancy, and has not yet gained much trust in the community, mainly because of its (unknown) security and privacy implications. To advance the state of the research in this area and to realize extensive utilization of the FL approach and its mass adoption, its security and privacy concerns must be first identified, evaluated, and documented. FL is preferred in use-cases where security and privacy are the key concerns and having a clear view and understanding of risk factors enable an implementer/adopter of FL to successfully build a secure environment and gives researchers a clear vision on possible research areas. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study concerning FL's security and privacy aspects that can help bridge the gap between the current state of federated AI and a future in which mass adoption is possible. We present an illustrative description of approaches and various implementation styles with an examination of the current challenges in FL and establish a detailed review of security and privacy concerns that need to be considered in a thorough and clear context. Findings from our study suggest that overall there are fewer privacy-specific threats associated with FL compared to security threats. The most specific security threats currently are communication bottlenecks, poisoning, and backdoor attacks while inference-based attacks are the most critical to the privacy of FL. We conclude the paper with much needed future research directions to make FL adaptable in realistic scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, X; Zhang, W; Xu, NX; Ding, Q				Li, Xiang; Zhang, Wei; Xu, Nan-Xi; Ding, Qian			Deep Learning-Based Machinery Fault Diagnostics With Domain Adaptation Across Sensors at Different Places	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Sensors; Training; Testing; Machinery; Fault diagnosis; Task analysis; Vibrations; Deep learning; fault diagnosis; rotating machines; transfer learning	BEARINGS	In the recent years, data-driven machinery fault diagnostic methods have been successfully developed, and the tasks where the training and testing data are from the same distribution have been well addressed. However, due to sensor malfunctions, the training and testing data can be collected at different places of machines, resulting in the feature space with significant distribution discrepancy. This challenging issue has received less attention in the current literature, and the existing approaches generally fail in such scenarios. This article proposes a domain adaptation method for machinery fault diagnostics based on deep learning. Adversarial training is introduced for marginal domain fusion, and unsupervised parallel data are explored to achieve conditional distribution alignments with respect to different machine health conditions. Experiments on two rotating machinery datasets are carried out for validations. The results suggest the proposed method is promising to address the fault diagnostic tasks with data from different places of machines, further enhancing applicability of data-driven methods in real industries.

In recent years, this study area has been greatly influenced by several head-cut gullies due to unusual climatic factors and human induced activity. The present study is therefore intended to address this issue by developing head-cut gully erosion prediction maps using boosting ensemble machine learning algorithms, namely Boosted Tree (BT), Boosted Generalized Linear Models (BGLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Deep Boost (DB). Initially, we produced a gully erosion inventory map using a variety of resources, including published reports, Google Earth images, and field records of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Subsequently, we distributed this information randomly and choose 70% (102) of the test gullies and the remaining 30% (43) for validation. The methodology was designed using morphometric and thematic determinants, including 14 head-cut gully erosion conditioning features. We have also investigated the following: (a) Multi-collinearity analysis to determine the linearity of the independent variables, (b) Predictive capability of piping models using train and test dataset and (c) Variables importance affecting head-cut gully erosion. The study reveals that altitude, land use, distances from road and soil characteristics influenced the method with the greatest impact on head-cut gully erosion susceptibility. We presented five head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps and investigated their predictive accuracy through area under curve (AUC). The AUC test reveals that the DB machine learning method demonstrated significantly higher accuracy (AUC = 0.95) than the BT (AUC = 0.93), BGLM (AUC = 0.91), BRT (AUC = 0.94) and XGB (AUC = 0.92) approaches. The predicted head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps can be used by policy makers and local authorities for soil conservation and to prevent threats to human activities.

Identifying degradation patterns of lithium ion batteries from impedance spectroscopy using machine learning	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							STATE-OF-HEALTH; GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION; CAPACITY; PERFORMANCE; CELLS; PACKS; CALENDAR; MODEL	Forecasting the state of health and remaining useful life of Li-ion batteries is an unsolved challenge that limits technologies such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles. Here, we build an accurate battery forecasting system by combining electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-a real-time, non-invasive and information-rich measurement that is hitherto underused in battery diagnosis-with Gaussian process machine learning. Over 20,000 EIS spectra of commercial Li-ion batteries are collected at different states of health, states of charge and temperatures-the largest dataset to our knowledge of its kind. Our Gaussian process model takes the entire spectrum as input, without further feature engineering, and automatically determines which spectral features predict degradation. Our model accurately predicts the remaining useful life, even without complete knowledge of past operating conditions of the battery. Our results demonstrate the value of EIS signals in battery management systems.

Here, we develop a target-driven method to predict undiscovered hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) for photovoltaics. This strategy, combining machine learning techniques and density functional theory calculations, aims to quickly screen the HOIPs based on bandgap and solve the problems of toxicity and poor environmental stability in HOIPs. Successfully, six orthorhombic lead-free HOIPs with proper bandgap for solar cells and room temperature thermal stability are screened out from 5158 unexplored HOIPs and two of them stand out with direct bandgaps in the visible region and excellent environmental stability.

Federated Learning With Differential Privacy: Algorithms and Performance Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Federated learning; differential privacy; convergence performance; information leakage; client selection	COMMUNICATION	Federated learning (FL), as a type of distributed machine learning, is capable of significantly preserving clients' private data from being exposed to adversaries. Nevertheless, private information can still be divulged by analyzing uploaded parameters from clients, e.g., weights trained in deep neural networks. In this paper, to effectively prevent information leakage, we propose a novel framework based on the concept of differential privacy (DP), in which artificial noise is added to parameters at the clients' side before aggregating, namely, noising before model aggregation FL (NbAFL). First, we prove that the NbAFL can satisfy DP under distinct protection levels by properly adapting different variances of artificial noise. Then we develop a theoretical convergence bound on the loss function of the trained FL model in the NbAFL. Specifically, the theoretical bound reveals the following three key properties: 1) there is a tradeoff between convergence performance and privacy protection levels, i.e., better convergence performance leads to a lower protection level; 2) given a fixed privacy protection level, increasing the number N of overall clients participating in FL can improve the convergence performance; and 3) there is an optimal number aggregation times (communication rounds) in terms of convergence performance for a given protection level. Furthermore, we propose a K-client random scheduling strategy, where K (1 <= K <= N) clients are randomly selected from the N overall clients to participate in each aggregation. We also develop a corresponding convergence bound for the loss function in this case and the K -client random scheduling strategy also retains the above three properties. Moreover, we find that there is an optimal K that achieves the best convergence performance at a fixed privacy level. Evaluations demonstrate that our theoretical results are consistent with simulations, thereby facilitating the design of various privacy-preserving FL algorithms with different tradeoff requirements on convergence performance and privacy levels.

Survey on deep learning with class imbalance	JOURNAL OF BIG DATA			English	Article						Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Class imbalance; Big data	CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; FRAUD; SMOTE	The purpose of this study is to examine existing deep learning techniques for addressing class imbalanced data. Effective classification with imbalanced data is an important area of research, as high class imbalance is naturally inherent in many real-world applications, e.g., fraud detection and cancer detection. Moreover, highly imbalanced data poses added difficulty, as most learners will exhibit bias towards the majority class, and in extreme cases, may ignore the minority class altogether. Class imbalance has been studied thoroughly over the last two decades using traditional machine learning models, i.e. non-deep learning. Despite recent advances in deep learning, along with its increasing popularity, very little empirical work in the area of deep learning with class imbalance exists. Having achieved record-breaking performance results in several complex domains, investigating the use of deep neural networks for problems containing high levels of class imbalance is of great interest. Available studies regarding class imbalance and deep learning are surveyed in order to better understand the efficacy of deep learning when applied to class imbalanced data. This survey discusses the implementation details and experimental results for each study, and offers additional insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Several areas of focus include: data complexity, architectures tested, performance interpretation, ease of use, big data application, and generalization to other domains. We have found that research in this area is very limited, that most existing work focuses on computer vision tasks with convolutional neural networks, and that the effects of big data are rarely considered. Several traditional methods for class imbalance, e.g. data sampling and cost-sensitive learning, prove to be applicable in deep learning, while more advanced methods that exploit neural network feature learning abilities show promising results. The survey concludes with a discussion that highlights various gaps in deep learning from class imbalanced data for the purpose of guiding future research.

DL was proven to have the potential to predict complex system states accurately and relieve the "curse of dimensionality" in large temporal and spatial geophysical applications. We address the basic concepts, state-of-the-art literature, and future trends by reviewing DL approaches in various geosciences scenarios. Exploration geophysics, earthquakes, and remote sensing are the main focuses. More applications, including Earth structure, water resources, atmospheric science, and space science, are also reviewed. Additionally, the difficulties of applying DL in the geophysical community are discussed. The trends of DL in geophysics in recent years are analyzed. Several promising directions are provided for future research involving DL in geophysics, such as unsupervised learning, transfer learning, multimodal DL, federated learning, uncertainty estimation, and active learning. A coding tutorial and a summary of tips for rapidly exploring DL are presented for beginners and interested readers of geophysics.

Secure, privacy-preserving and federated machine learning in medical imaging	NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Review							BREAST-CANCER; INFERENCE; ATTACKS; AGE	The broad application of artificial intelligence techniques in medicine is currently hindered by limited dataset availability for algorithm training and validation, due to the absence of standardized electronic medical records, and strict legal and ethical requirements to protect patient privacy. In medical imaging, harmonized data exchange formats such as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and electronic data storage are the standard, partially addressing the first issue, but the requirements for privacy preservation are equally strict. To prevent patient privacy compromise while promoting scientific research on large datasets that aims to improve patient care, the implementation of technical solutions to simultaneously address the demands for data protection and utilization is mandatory. Here we present an overview of current and next-generation methods for federated, secure and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence with a focus on medical imaging applications, alongside potential attack vectors and future prospects in medical imaging and beyond. Medical imaging data is often subject to privacy and intellectual property restrictions. AI techniques can help out by offering tools like federated learning to bridge the gap between personal data protection and data utilisation for research and clinical routine, but these tools need to be secure.

Deep Learning-Based Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things towards Effective Energy Management for Smart Buildings	SENSORS			English	Article						smart systems; internet of things; machine learning; energy management	BIG DATA; IOT; STRATEGIES; SYSTEM	Worldwide, energy consumption and saving represent the main challenges for all sectors, most importantly in industrial and domestic sectors. The internet of things (IoT) is a new technology that establishes the core of Industry 4.0. The IoT enables the sharing of signals between devices and machines via the internet. Besides, the IoT system enables the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to manage and control the signals between different machines based on intelligence decisions. The paper's innovation is to introduce a deep learning and IoT based approach to control the operation of air conditioners in order to reduce energy consumption. To achieve such an ambitious target, we have proposed a deep learning-based people detection system utilizing the YOLOv3 algorithm to count the number of persons in a specific area. Accordingly, the operation of the air conditioners could be optimally managed in a smart building. Furthermore, the number of persons and the status of the air conditioners are published via the internet to the dashboard of the IoT platform. The proposed system enhances decision making about energy consumption. To affirm the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed approach, intensive test scenarios are simulated in a specific smart building considering the existence of air conditioners. The simulation results emphasize that the proposed deep learning-based recognition algorithm can accurately detect the number of persons in the specified area, thanks to its ability to model highly non-linear relationships in data. The detection status can also be successfully published on the dashboard of the IoT platform. Another vital application of the proposed promising approach is in the remote management of diverse controllable devices.

A standard methodwas applied for assessing the vulnerability of groundwater to nitrate pollution in Lenjanat plain, Iran. Nitrate concentration were collected from 102 wells of the plain and used to provide pollution occurrence and probability maps. Three machine learning models including boosted regression trees (BRT), multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), and support vector machine (SVM) were used for the probability of groundwater pollution occurrence. Afterwards, an ensemble modeling approachwas applied for production of the groundwater pollution occurrence probabilitymap. Validation of the models was carried out using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve method (AUC); values above 80% were selected to contribute in ensembling process. Results indicated that accuracy for the three models ranged from 0.81 to 0.87, therefore all models were considered for ensemble modeling process. The resultant groundwater pollution risk (produced by vulnerability, pollution, and probability maps) indicated that the central regions of the plain have high and very high risk of nitrate pollution further confirmed by the exiting landuse map. The findings may provide very helpful information in decision making for groundwater pollution risk management especially in semi-arid regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID-19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 US. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, economic inequality enhanced the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The per capita hospital beds correlated negatively with COVID-19 deaths. Blood types B and AB were protective factors for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV and influenza and pneumonia was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Increased intake of vegetables, edible oil, protein, vitamin D, and vitamin K was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk, while increased intake of alcohol was associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included age, sex, temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, health investment, urbanization level, and race. High temperature is a more compelling factor mitigating COVID-19 transmission than low temperature.

J	Sezer, OB; Gudelek, MU; Ozbayoglu, AM				Sezer, Omer Berat; Gudelek, Mehmet Ugur; Ozbayoglu, Ahmet Murat			Financial time series forecasting with deep learning : A systematic literature review: 2005-2019	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Review						Deep learning; Finance; Computational intelligence; Machine learning; Time series forecasting; CNN; LSTM; RNN	MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; TECHNICAL ANALYSIS; PREDICTION; VOLATILITY; RECURRENT; PRICE; LSTM; INTELLIGENCE; ECONOMICS	Financial time series forecasting is undoubtedly the top choice of computational intelligence for finance researchers in both academia and the finance industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial impact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers have created various models, and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant number of surveys exist covering ML studies on financial time series forecasting. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models have appeared within the field, with results that significantly outperform their traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting, there is a lack of review papers that solely focus on DL for finance. Hence, the motivation of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review of DL studies on financial time series forecasting implementation. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, and commodity forecasting, but we also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future of the field by highlighting its possible setbacks and opportunities for the benefit of interested researchers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Because of the noncommutative nature of quantum mechanics, the training process of the quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM) can become nontrivial. We circumvent the problem by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities. This allows us to train the QBM efficiently by sampling. We show examples of QBM training with and without the bound, using exact diagonalization, and compare the results with classical Boltzmann training. We also discuss the possibility of using quantum annealing processors for QBM training and application.

Alternative tools are needed that can help in diagnosis of the coronavirus. Researchers of this article investigated the potential of machine learning methods for automatic diagnosis of corona virus with high accuracy from X-ray images. Two most commonly used classifiers were selected: logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The main reason was to make the system fast and efficient. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction approach was also investigated based on principal component analysis (PCA) to further speed up the learning process and improve the classification accuracy by selecting the highly discriminate features. The deep learning-based methods demand large amount of training samples compared to conventional approaches, yet adequate amount of labelled training samples was not available for COVID-19 X-ray images. Therefore, data augmentation technique using generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed to further increase the training samples and reduce the overfitting problem. We used the online available dataset and incorporated GAN to have 500 X-ray images in total for this study. Both CNN and LR showed encouraging results for COVID-19 patient identification. The LR and CNN models showed 95.2-97.6% overall accuracy without PCA and 97.6-100% with PCA for positive cases identification, respectively.

These biological networks provide a wealth of raw materials for further understanding of biological systems, the discovery of complex diseases and the search for therapeutic drugs. However, the increase in data also increases the difficulty of biological networks analysis. Therefore, algorithms that can handle large, heterogeneous and complex data are needed to better analyze the data of these network structures and mine their useful information. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that extracts more abstract features from a larger set of training data. Through the establishment of an artificial neural network with a network hierarchy structure, deep learning can extract and screen the input information layer by layer and has representation learning ability. The improved deep learning algorithm can be used to process complex and heterogeneous graph data structures and is increasingly being applied to the mining of network data information. In this paper, we first introduce the used network data deep learning models. After words, we summarize the application of deep learning on biological networks. Finally, we discuss the future development prospects of this field.

Categorized in three broad types (i.e. images, signals, and sequences), these data are huge in amount and complex in nature. Mining such enormous amount of data for pattern recognition is a big challenge and requires sophisticated data-intensive machine learning techniques. Artificial neural network-based learning systems are well known for their pattern recognition capabilities, and lately their deep architectures-known as deep learning (DL)-have been successfully applied to solve many complex pattern recognition problems. To investigate how DL-especially its different architectures-has contributed and been utilized in the mining of biological data pertaining to those three types, a meta-analysis has been performed and the resulting resources have been critically analysed. Focusing on the use of DL to analyse patterns in data from diverse biological domains, this work investigates different DL architectures' applications to these data. This is followed by an exploration of available open access data sources pertaining to the three data types along with popular open-source DL tools applicable to these data. Also, comparative investigations of these tools from qualitative, quantitative, and benchmarking perspectives are provided. Finally, some open research challenges in using DL to mine biological data are outlined and a number of possible future perspectives are put forward.	[Mahmud, Mufti; McGinnity, T.

In this paper, we developed NeuroSim, a circuit-level macro model that estimates the area, latency, dynamic energy, and leakage power to facilitate the design space exploration of neuro-inspired architectures with mainstream and emerging device technologies. NeuroSim provides flexible interface and a wide variety of design options at the circuit and device level. Therefore, NeuroSim can be used by neural networks (NNs) as a supporting tool to provide circuit-level performance evaluation. With NeuroSim, an integrated framework can be built with hierarchical organization from the device level (synaptic device properties) to the circuit level (array architectures) and then to the algorithm level (NN topology), enabling instruction-accurate evaluation on the learning accuracy as well as the circuit-level performance metrics at the run-time of online learning. Using multilayer perceptron as a case-study algorithm, we investigated the impact of the "analog" emerging nonvolatile memory (eNVM)'s "nonideal" device properties and benchmarked the tradeoffs between SRAM, digital, and analog eNVM-based architectures for online learning and offline classification.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: Two thousand four hundred sixty-three pairs of VF and OCT images from 1083 patients. Methods: FusionNet based on bimodal input of VF and OCT paired data was developed to detect GON. Visual field data were collected using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA). OCT images were collected from 3 types of devices (DRI-OCT, Cirrus OCT, and Spectralis). Two thousand four hundred sixty-three pairs of VF and OCT images were divided into 4 datasets: 1567 for training (HFA and DRI-OCT), 441 for primary validation (HFA and DRI-OCT), 255 for the internal test (HFA and Cirrus OCT), and 200 for the external test set (HFA and Spectralis). GON was defined as retinal nerve fiber layer thinning with corresponding VF defects. Main Outcome Measures: Diagnostic performance of FusionNet compared with that of VFNet (with VF data as input) and OCTNet (with OCT data as input). Results: FusionNet achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.950 (0.931-0.968) and outperformed VFNet (AUC, 0.868 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.834-0.902]), OCTNet (AUC, 0.809 [95% CI, 0.768-0.850]), and 2 glaucoma specialists (glaucoma specialist 1: AUC, 0.882 [95% CI, 0.847-0.917]; glaucoma specialist 2: AUC, 0.883 [95% CI, 0.849-0.918]) in the primary validation set. In the internal and external test sets, the performances of FusionNet were also superior to VFNet and OCTNet (FusionNet vs VFNet vs OCTNet: internal test set 0.917 vs 0.854 vs 0.811; external test set 0.873 vs 0.772 vs 0.785). No significant difference was found between the 2 glaucoma specialists and FusionNet in the internal and external test sets, except for glaucoma specialist 2 (AUC, 0.858 [95% CI, 0.805-0.912]) in the internal test set. Conclusions: FusionNet, developed using paired VF and OCT data, demonstrated superior performance to both VFNet and OCTNet in detecting GON, suggesting that multimodal machine learning models are valuable in detecting GON.

This paper introduces two categories for multi-view representation learning: multi-view representation alignment and multi-view representation fusion. Consequently, we first review the representative methods and theories of multi-view representation learning based on the perspective of alignment, such as correlation-based alignment. Representative examples are canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its several extensions. Then, from the perspective of representation fusion, we investigate the advancement of multi-view representation learning that ranges from generative methods including multi-modal topic learning, multi-view sparse coding, and multi-view latent space Markov networks, to neural network-based methods including multi-modal autoencoders, multi-view convolutional neural networks, and multi-modal recurrent neural networks. Further, we also investigate several important applications of multi-view representation learning. Overall, this survey aims to provide an insightful overview of theoretical foundation and state-of-the-art developments in the field of multi-view representation learning and to help researchers find the most appropriate tools for particular applications.

Short-term wind power forecasting based on support vector machine with improved dragonfly algorithm	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Wind power prediction; Support vector machine; Differential evolution; Improved dragonfly algorithm; Prediction accuracy	GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION; INTEGRATED MOVING AVERAGE; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; QUANTILE REGRESSION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; HYBRID METHOD; PREDICTION; ENGINE	It is hard to predict wind power with high-precision due to its non-stationary and stochastic nature. The wind power has developed rapidly around the world as a promising renewable energy industry. The uncertainty of wind power brings difficult challenges to the operation of the power system with the integration of wind farms into power grid. Accurate wind power prediction is increasingly important for the stable operation of wind farms and the power grid. This study is combined support vector machine and improved dragonfly algorithm to forecast short-term wind power for a hybrid prediction model. The adaptive learning factor and differential evolution strategy are introduced to improve the performance of traditional dragonfly algorithm. The improved dragonfly algorithm is used to choose the optimal parameters of support vector machine. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been confirmed on the real datasets derived from La Haute Borne wind farm in France. The proposed model has shown better prediction performance compared with the other models such as back propagation neural network and Gaussian process regression. The proposed model is suitable for short-term wind power prediction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very useful in fields such as image recognition; however, the use of CNNs in large-scale remote sensing landcover classifications still needs further investigation. We set out to test CNN-based landcover classification against a more conventional XGBoost shallow learning algorithm for mapping a notoriously difficult group of landcover classes, wetland class as defined by the Canadian Wetland Classification System. We developed two wetland inventory style products for a large (397,958 km(2)) area in the Boreal Forest region of Alberta, Canada, using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DEM data acquired in Google Earth Engine. We then tested the accuracy of these two products against three validation data sets (two photo-interpreted and one field). The CNN-generated wetland product proved to be more accurate than the shallow learning XGBoost wetland product by 5%. The overall accuracy of the CNN product was 80.2% with a mean F1-score of 0.58. We believe that CNNs are better able to capture natural complexities within wetland classes, and thus may be very useful for complex landcover classifications. Overall, this CNN framework shows great promise for generating large-scale wetland inventory data and may prove useful for other landcover mapping applications.

Business organizations need to process and study these sentiments to investigate data and to gain business insights. Hence, to analyze these sentiments, various machine learning, and natural language processing-based approaches have been used in the past. However, deep learning-based methods are becoming very popular due to their high performance in recent times. This paper provides a detailed survey of popular deep learning models that are increasingly applied in sentiment analysis. We present a taxonomy of sentiment analysis and discuss the implications of popular deep learning architectures. The key contributions of various researchers are highlighted with the prime focus on deep learning approaches. The crucial sentiment analysis tasks are presented, and multiple languages are identified on which sentiment analysis is done. The survey also summarizes the popular datasets, key features of the datasets, deep learning model applied on them, accuracy obtained from them, and the comparison of various deep learning models. The primary purpose of this survey is to highlight the power of deep learning architectures for solving sentiment analysis problems.

It is a frontier challenge to experimentally visualize and, subsequently, to understand the electrochemical consequences of battery particles' evolving (de)attachment with the conductive matrix. Herein, we tackle this issue with a unique combination of multiscale experimental approaches, machine-learning-assisted statistical analysis, and experiment-informed mathematical modeling. Our results suggest that the degree of particle detachment is positively correlated with the charging rate and that smaller particles exhibit a higher degree of uncertainty in their detachment from the carbon/binder matrix. We further explore the feasibility and limitation of utilizing the reconstructed electron density as a proxy for the state-of-charge. Our findings highlight the importance of precisely quantifying the evolving nature of the battery electrode's microstructure with statistical confidence, which is a key to maximize the utility of active particles towards higher battery capacity. Developing understanding of degradation phenomena in nickel rich cathodes is under intense investigation. Here the authors use learning-assisted statistical analysis and experiment-informed mathematical modelling to resolve the microstructure of a Ni-rich NMC composite cathode.

To avoid extensive cost of collecting and annotating large-scale datasets, as a subset of unsupervised learning methods, self-supervised learning methods are proposed to learn general image and video features from large-scale unlabeled data without using any human-annotated labels. This paper provides an extensive review of deep learning-based self-supervised general visual feature learning methods from images or videos. First, the motivation, general pipeline, and terminologies of this field are described. Then the common deep neural network architectures that used for self-supervised learning are summarized. Next, the schema and evaluation metrics of self-supervised learning methods are reviewed followed by the commonly used datasets for images, videos, audios, and 3D data, as well as the existing self-supervised visual feature learning methods. Finally, quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods on benchmark datasets are summarized and discussed for both image and video feature learning. At last, this paper is concluded and lists a set of promising future directions for self-supervised visual feature learning.

J	Chen, JS; Ran, XK				Chen, Jiasi; Ran, Xukan			Deep Learning With Edge Computing: A Review	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; edge computing; machine learning; mobile computing; neural networks	MOBILE; INTERNET	Deep learning is currently widely used in a variety of applications, including computer vision and natural language processing. End devices, such as smartphones and Internet-of-Things sensors, are generating data that need to be analyzed in real time using deep learning or used to train deep learning models. However, deep learning inference and training require substantial computation resources to run quickly. Edge computing, where a fine mesh of compute nodes are placed close to end devices, is a viable way to meet the high computation and low-latency requirements of deep learning on edge devices and also provides additional benefits in terms of privacy, bandwidth efficiency, and scalability. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of the art at the intersection of deep learning and edge computing. Specifically, it will provide an overview of applications where deep learning is used at the network edge, discuss various approaches for quickly executing deep learning inference across a combination of end devices, edge servers, and the cloud, and describe the methods for training deep learning models across multiple edge devices.

These landslides can be deadly to the community living downslope with their fast pace, turning failures into catastrophic debris flows and avalanches. Active tectonics coupled with rugged topography in a complex geoenvironment multiplies this likelihood. The available hazard maps are usually helpful in mitigating disasters. However, fool-proof predicting landslide susceptibility identification remains a challenge in landslide discipline. Recently, ensemble machine learning (ML) techniques have proved the potential to provide a more accurate and efficient solution in spatial modeling. The main purposes of the current study are to examine and evaluate the predictive capability of support vector machine hybrid ensemble ML algorithms, i.e., the bagging, boosting, and stacking for modeling the catastrophic rainfall-induced landslide occurrences in the Northern parts of Kyushu Island, at the watershed scale in Japan. In this study, a landslide inventory map containing 265 landslide polygons was first interpreted from the aerial photographs and fieldwork after the September 2017 rainfall event. The raw data were randomly separated into two parts using a 70/30 sampling strategy for training and validating the landslide models. Then, 13 predisposing factors were prepared as predictors and dependent variable. The landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) were validated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results of validation showed that the AUC values of the four models (SVM-Stacking, SVM, SVM-Bagging, and SVM-Boosting) varied from 0.74 to 0.91. The SVM-boosting model outperformed the other models, while SVM-stacking model has found to be the lowest performance. The outcome suggests that an ensemble ML model does not necessarily mean good performance. It is always preferable to select an appropriate model, such as the one proposed the hybrid novel ensemble SVM-boosting model, which could significantly improve the accuracies of LSM. Also, from Information Gain Ratio (IGR) we found that the rainfall factor mainly affects the results, that agrees with the analogy of present study.

Such cropland extent products capture individual farm fields, small or large, and are crucial for developing accurate higher-level cropland products such as cropping intensities, crop types, crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), crop productivity, and crop water productivity. It also brings many challenges that include handling massively large data volumes, computing power, and collecting resource intensive reference training and validation data over complex geographic and political boundaries. Thereby, this study developed a precise and accurate Landsat 30-m derived cropland extent product for two very important, distinct, diverse, and large countries: Australia and China. The study used of eight bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR1, and NDVI) of Landsat-8 every 16-day Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for the years 2013-2015. The classification was performed by using a pixel-based supervised random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm (MLA) executed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Each band was time-composited over 4-6 time-periods over a year using median value for various agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Australia and China. This resulted in a 32-48-layer mega-file data-cube (MFDC) for each of the AEZs. Reference training and validation data were gathered from: (a) field visits, (b) sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) data, and (c) ancillary sources such as from the National agriculture bureaus. Croplands versus non-croplands knowledge base for training the RF algorithm were derived from MFDC using 958 reference-training samples for Australia and 2130 reference-training samples for China. The resulting 30-m cropland extent product was assessed for accuracies using independent validation samples: 900 for Australia and 1972 for China. The 30-m cropland extent product of Australia showed an overall accuracy of 97.6% with a producer's accuracy of 98.8% (errors of omissions = 1.2%), and user's accuracy of 79% (errors of commissions = 21%) for the cropland class. For China, overall accuracies were 94% with a producer's accuracy of 80% (errors of omissions = 20%), and user's accuracy of 84.2% (errors of commissions = 15.8%) for cropland class. Total cropland areas of Australia were estimated as 35.1 million hectares and 165.2 million hectares for China. These estimates were higher by 8.6% for Australia and 3.9% for China when compared with the traditionally derived national statistics. The cropland extent product further demonstrated the ability to estimate sub-national cropland areas accurately by providing an R-2 value of 0.85 when compared with province-wise cropland areas of China. The study provides a paradigm-shift on how cropland maps are produced using multi-date remote sensing.

The fundamentals of the background of the ensemble machine learning methods are firstly introduced, and four typical ensemble machine learnning models such as random forest, adoptive boosting, gradient boosting regression tree and extreme gradient boosting are utlized in this study to obtain the predictive model. Then the implementation procedure using these methods to train a predictive model is given in details. The input data is split into training and testing sets, the 10-fold cross validation is used to evaluate the model performance, the grid search method is used to find the hyper-parameters, and the feature importance and partial dependence analysis are adopted as the interpretation of the model outputs. To use the ensemble methods to predict the shear strength of reinforced concrete deep beams, in total 271 test data was collected for training the models. The models all achieve good capacity in predicting the shear strength, and demonstrate superior performance over traditional machine learnning methods. Meanwhile, the classical mechanics-driven shear models are also employed as comparisons. The sensitivity of the key factors in ensemble models is analyzed and the importances of the input variables are obtained. It is shown that the ensemble machine learnning models are significantly superior to mechanics-driven models in both predicting accuracy and discrepancy.

Originally applied almost exclusively in computer-science areas such as image analysis and nature language processing, deep learning has rapidly entered a wide variety of scientific fields including physics, chemistry and material science. Very recently, deep neural networks have been introduced in the field of nano-photonics as a powerful way of obtaining the nonlinear mapping between the topology and composition of arbitrary nanophotonic structures and their associated functional properties. In this paper, we have discussed the recent progress in the application of deep learning to the inverse design of nanophotonic devices, mainly focusing on the three existing learning paradigms of supervised-, unsupervised-, and reinforcement learning. Deep learning forward modelling i.e. how artificial intelligence learns how to solve Maxwell's equations, is also discussed, along with an outlook of this rapidly evolving research area.

We developed a machine learning-based risk stratification model to predict all-cause death, recurrent acute myocardial infarction, and major bleeding after ACS. Methods Different machine learning models for the prediction of 1-year post-discharge all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and major bleeding (defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5) were trained on a cohort of 19 826 adult patients with ACS (split into a training cohort [80%] and internal validation cohort [20%]) from the BleeMACS and RENAMI registries, which included patients across several continents. 25 clinical features routinely assessed at discharge were used to inform the models. The best-performing model for each study outcome (the PRAISE score) was tested in an external validation cohort of 3444 patients with ACS pooled from a randomised controlled trial and three prospective registries. Model performance was assessed according to a range of learning metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Findings The PRAISE score showed an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.85) in the internal validation cohort and 0.92 (0.90-0.93) in the external validation cohort for 1-year all-cause death; an AUC of 0.74 (0.70-0.78) in the internal validation cohort and 0.81 (0.76-0.85) in the external validation cohort for 1-year myocardial infarction; and an AUC of 0.70 (0.66-0.75) in the internal validation cohort and 0.86 (0.82-0.89) in the external validation cohort for 1-year major bleeding. Interpretation A machine learning-based approach for the identification of predictors of events after an ACS is feasible and effective.

J	Zhang, W; Li, X				Zhang, Wei; Li, Xiang			Federated Transfer Learning for Intelligent Fault Diagnostics Using Deep Adversarial Networks With Data Privacy	IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Data models; Transfer learning; Fault diagnosis; Data privacy; Training; Testing; Data privacy; deep learning; fault diagnosis; federated learning; rotating machines		Intelligent data-driven machinery fault diagnosis methods have been popularly developed in the past years. While fairly high diagnosis accuracies have been obtained, large amounts of labeled training data are mostly required, which are difficult to collect in practice. The promising collaborative model training solution with multiple users poses high demands on data privacy due to conflict of interests. Furthermore, in the real industries, the data from different users can be usually collected from different machine operating conditions. The domain shift phenomenon and data privacy concern make the joint model training scheme quite challenging. To address this issue, a federated transfer learning method for fault diagnosis is proposed in this article. Different models can be used by different users to enhance data privacy. A federal initialization stage is introduced to keep similar data structures in distributed feature extractions, and a federated communication stage is further implemented using deep adversarial learning. A prediction consistency scheme is also adopted to increase model robustness. Experiments on two real-world datasets suggest the proposed federated transfer learning method is promising for real industrial applications.

To contain its spread, a number of countries published control measures. However, it's not known when the epidemic will end in global and various countries. Predicting the trend of COVID-19 is an extremely important challenge. We integrate the most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data before June 16, 2020 into the Logistic model to fit the cap of epidemic trend, and then feed the cap value into FbProphet model, a machine learning based time series prediction model to derive the epidemic curve and predict the trend of the epidemic. Three significant points are summarized from our modeling results for global, Brazil, Russia, India, Peru and Indonesia. Under mathematical estimation, the global outbreak will peak in late October, with an estimated 14.12 million people infected cumulatively. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objectives of this review were to analyze recent advances in water quality remote sensing and determine limitations of current systems, estimation methods, and suggest future improvements. To that end, we collected over 200 sets of water quality data including blue-green algae phycocyanin (BGA-PC), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), specific conductivity (SC), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), turbidity, and pollution-sediments from 2016 to 2018. The water quality data, generated from laboratory analysis of grab samples and in situ real-time monitoring sensors distributed in eight lakes and rivers in Midwestern United States, were paired with synchronous proximal spectra, tripod-mounted hyperspectral imagery, and satellite data. The results showed that both proximal and satellite-based sensors have great potential to provide accurate estimate of optically active parameters, and remote sensing of non-optically active parameters may be indirectly estimated but still remains a challenge. Data-driven empirical approaches, i.e., deep learning outperformed the other competing methods, providing promising possibility for operational use of remote sensing in water quality monitoring and decision-making. As the first-time review of deep neural networks for water quality estimation, the paper concludes that anomaly detection utilizing multi-sensor data fusion and virtual constellation in cloud-computing is the most promising means for predicting impending water pollution outbreaks such as algal blooms.

Consequently, traditional ML models in many applications have been replaced by the new learning techniques and the landscape of ITS is being reshaped. Under such perspective, we provide a comprehensive survey that focuses on the utilization of deep learning models to enhance the intelligence level of transportation systems.

However, the performance gain of edge computing may be severely compromised due to limited spectrum resources, capacity-constrained batteries, and context unawareness. In this article, we consider the optimization of channel selection that is critical for efficient and reliable task delivery. We aim at maximizing the long-term throughput subject to long-term constraints of energy budget and service reliability. We propose a learning-based channel selection framework with service reliability awareness, energy awareness, backlog awareness, and conflict awareness, by leveraging the combined power of machine learning, Lyapunov optimization, and matching theory. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis, and prove that the proposed framework can achieve guaranteed performance with a bounded deviation from the optimal performance with global state information (GSI) based on only local and causal information. Finally, simulations are conducted under both single-MTD and multi-MTD scenarios to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed framework.

Deep learning for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification tasks: a review	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						deep learning; electroencephalogram (EEG); classification; convolutional neural networks; deep belief networks; multi-layer perceptron neural networks; stacked auto-encoders	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MOTOR IMAGERY; SLEEP; RECOGNITION; DEPENDENCIES; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; EMOTIONS; SCHEME	Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain-computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.

To address this important issue, ambient light photovoltaic cells were developed to power autonomous Internet of Things (IoT) devices, capable of machine learning, allowing the on-device implementation of artificial intelligence. Through a novel co-sensitization strategy, we tailored dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells based on a copper(II/I) electrolyte for the generation of power under ambient lighting with an unprecedented conversion efficiency (34%, 103 mu W cm(-2) at 1000 lux; 32.7%, 50 mu W cm(-2) at 500 lux and 31.4%, 19 mu W cm(-2) at 200 lux from a fluorescent lamp). A small array of DSCs with a joint active area of 16 cm(2) was then used to power machine learning on wireless nodes. The collection of 0.947 mJ or 2.72 x 10(15) photons is needed to compute one inference of a pre-trained artificial neural network for MNIST image classification in the employed set up. The inference accuracy of the network exceeded 90% for standard test images and 80% using camera-acquired printed MNIST-digits. Quantization of the neural network significantly reduced memory requirements with a less than 0.1% loss in accuracy compared to a full-precision network, making machine learning inferences on low-power microcontrollers possible. 152 J or 4.41 x 10(20) photons required for training and verification of an artificial neural network were harvested with 64 cm(2) photovoltaic area in less than 24 hours under 1000 lux illumination. Ambient light harvesters provide a new generation of self-powered and "smart" IoT devices powered through an energy source that is largely untapped.

It often results in subpar living conditions for a patient as they have to go through expensive and painful treatments to fight this cancer. One in eight women all over the world is affected by this disease. Almost half a million women annually do not survive this fight and die from this disease. Machine learning algorithms have proven to outperform all existing solutions for the prediction of breast cancer using models built on the previously available data. In this paper, a novel approach named BCD-WERT is proposed that utilizes the Extremely Randomized Tree and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for efficient feature selection and classification. WOA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and extracts the relevant features for accurate classification. Experimental results on state-of-the-art comprehensive dataset demonstrated improved performance in comparison with eight other machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Kernel Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gaussian Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor. BCD-WERT outperformed all with the highest accuracy rate of 99.30% followed by SVM achieving 98.60% accuracy. Experimental results also reveal the effectiveness of feature selection techniques in improving prediction accuracy.

The present and future of deep learning in radiology	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY			English	Review						Deep learning; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Radiology	LEFT-VENTRICLE; AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION; LIVER-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; ULTRASOUND; NETWORKS; REPRESENTATIONS; STRATIFICATION; AUTOENCODER; FRAMEWORK	The advent of Deep Learning (DL) is poised to dramatically change the delivery of healthcare in the near future. Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs. A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only. We have further examined the ethic, moral and legal issues surrounding the use of DL in medical imaging.

Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) including Naive Bayes (NB), radial basis function (RBF) Classifier, and RBF Network for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) at Longhai area in China. A total of 14 landslide conditioning factors were obtained from various data sources, then the frequency ratio (FR) and support vector machine (SVM) methods were used for the correlation and selection the most important factors for modelling process, respectively. Subsequently, the resulting three models were validated and compared using some statistical metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, and Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests The results indicated that the RBF Classifier model had the highest goodness-of-fit and performance based on the training and validation datasets. The results concluded that the RBF Classifier model outperformed and outclassed (AUROC = 0.881), the NB (AUROC = 0.872) and the RBF Network (AUROC = 0.854) models. The obtained results pointed out that the RBF Classifier model is a promising method for spatial prediction of landslide over the world. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most of the successful approaches act in a supervised manner, labeling training data as being of positive or negative moments of the market. However, training machine learning classifiers in such a way may suffer from over-fitting, since the market behavior depends on several external factors like other markets trends, political events, etc. In this paper, we aim at minimizing such problems by proposing an ensemble of reinforcement learning approaches which do not use annotations (i.e. market goes up or down) to learn, but rather learn how to maximize a return function over the training stage. In order to achieve this goal, we exploit a Q-learning agent trained several times with the same training data and investigate its ensemble behavior in important real-world stock markets. Experimental results in intraday trading indicate better performance than the conventional Buy-and-Hold strategy, which still behaves well in our setups. We also discuss qualitative and quantitative analyses of these results.

A Machine Learning Approach Enables Quantitative Measurement of Liver Histology and Disease Monitoring in NASH	HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							SCORING SYSTEM; INFLAMMATION; BIOPSIES; FIBROSIS	Background and Aims Manual histological assessment is currently the accepted standard for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression in NASH, but is limited by variability in interpretation and insensitivity to change. Thus, there is a critical need for improved tools to assess liver pathology in order to risk stratify NASH patients and monitor treatment response. Approach and Results Here, we describe a machine learning (ML)-based approach to liver histology assessment, which accurately characterizes disease severity and heterogeneity, and sensitively quantifies treatment response in NASH. We use samples from three randomized controlled trials to build and then validate deep convolutional neural networks to measure key histological features in NASH, including steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis. The ML-based predictions showed strong correlations with expert pathologists and were prognostic of progression to cirrhosis and liver-related clinical events. We developed a heterogeneity-sensitive metric of fibrosis response, the Deep Learning Treatment Assessment Liver Fibrosis score, which measured antifibrotic treatment effects that went undetected by manual pathological staging and was concordant with histological disease progression. Conclusions Our ML method has shown reproducibility and sensitivity and was prognostic for disease progression, demonstrating the power of ML to advance our understanding of disease heterogeneity in NASH, risk stratify affected patients, and facilitate the development of therapies.

Up to now, various findings of activated patterns associated with different emotions have been reported. However, their stability over time has not been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we focus on identifying EEG stability in emotion recognition. We systematically evaluate the performance of various popular feature extraction, feature selection, feature smoothing and pattern classification methods with the DEAP dataset and a newly developed dataset called SEED for this study. Discriminative Graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine with differential entropy features achieves the best average accuracies of 69.67 and 91.07 percent on the DEAP and SEED datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that stable patterns exhibit consistency across sessions; the lateral temporal areas activate more for positive emotions than negative emotions in beta and gamma bands; the neural patterns of neutral emotions have higher alpha responses at parietal and occipital sites; and for negative emotions, the neural patterns have significant higher delta responses at parietal and occipital sites and higher gamma responses at prefrontal sites. The performance of our emotion recognition models shows that the neural patterns are relatively stable within and between sessions.

However, experimental work is time-consuming; employing soft machine learning techniques can accelerate the process of forecasting the strength properties of concrete. Ensemble machine learning modeling using Python Jupyter Notebook was employed in the forecasting of compressive strength (CS) of high-performance concrete. Multilayer perceptron neuron network (MLPNN) and decision tree (DT) were used as individual learning which then ensembled with bagging and boosting to provide strong correlations. Random forest (RF) and gradient boosting regression (GBR) were also used for prediction. A total of 471 data points with input parameters (e.g., cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, superplasticizer, water, days, and fly ash), and an output parameter of compressive strength (CS), were retrieved to train and test the individual learners. Cross-validation with K-fold and statistical error (i.e., MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMSLE) analysis was applied to check the accuracy of all models. All models showed the best correlation with an ensemble model rather than an individual one. DT with AdaBoost and random forest gave a strong correlation of R-2 = 0.89 with fewer errors. Cross-validation results revealed a good response with an error of less than 10 MPa. Thus, ensemble modeling not only trains the data by employing several weak learners but also produces a robust correlation that can then be used to model and predict the mechanical performance of concrete.

J	Elnagar, A; Al-Debsi, R; Einea, O				Elnagar, Ashraf; Al-Debsi, Ridhwan; Einea, Omar			Arabic text classification using deep learning models	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Arabic text classification/categorization; Single-label text categorization; Multi-label text categorization; Word embedding; Deep learning; SANAD; NADiA	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; CATEGORIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; MACHINE; FUTURE	Text classification or categorization is the process of automatically tagging a textual document with most relevant labels or categories. When the number of labels is restricted to one, the task becomes single-label text categorization. However, the multi-label version is challenging. For Arabic language, both tasks (especially the latter one) become more challenging in the absence of large and free Arabic rich and rational datasets. Therefore, we introduce new rich and unbiased datasets for both the single-label (SANAD) as well as the multi-label (NADiA) Arabic text categorization tasks. Both corpora are made freely available to the research community on Arabic computational linguistics. Further, we present an extensive comparison of several deep learning (DL) models for Arabic text categorization in order to evaluate the effectiveness of such models on SANAD and NADiA. A unique characteristic of our proposed work, when compared to existing ones, is that it does not require a pre-processing phase and fully based on deep learning models. Besides, we studied the impact of utilizing word2vec embedding models to improve the performance of the classification tasks. Our experimental results showed solid performance of all models on SANAD corpus with a minimum accuracy of 91.18%, achieved by convolutional-GRU, and top performance of 96.94%, achieved by attention-GRU. As for NADiA, attention-GRU achieved the highest overall accuracy of 88.68% for a maximum subsets of 10 categories on "Masrawy" dataset.

Machine learning for digital soil mapping: Applications, challenges and suggested solutions	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Review						Soil science; Pedometrics; Data mining; Spatial data; Geostatistics; Random forest	ORGANIC-CARBON STOCKS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; RANDOM FOREST; SPATIAL PREDICTION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; CLASSIFICATION-TREE; CROSS-VALIDATION; MAP UNITS; SEMIARID REGION	The uptake of machine learning (ML) algorithms in digital soil mapping (DSM) is transforming the way soil scientists produce their maps. Within the past two decades, soil scientists have applied ML to a wide range of scenarios, by mapping soil properties or classes with various ML algorithms, on spatial scale from the local to the global, and with depth. The wide adoption of ML for soil mapping was made possible by the increase in data availability, the ease of accessing environmental spatial data, and the development of software solutions aided by computational tools to analyse them. In this article, we review the current use of ML in DSM, identify the key challenges and suggest solutions from the existing literature. There is a growing interest in the use of ML in DSM. Most studies emphasize prediction and accuracy of the predicted maps for applications, such as baseline production of quantitative soil information. Few studies account for existing soil knowledge in the modelling process or quantify the uncertainty of the predicted maps. Further, we discuss the challenges related to the application of ML for soil mapping and suggest solutions from existing studies in the natural sciences. The challenges are: sampling, resampling, accounting for the spatial information, multivariate mapping, uncertainty analysis, validation, integration of pedological knowledge and interpretation of the models. Overall, the current literature shows few attempts in understanding the underlying soil structure or process using the predicted maps and the ML model, for example by generating hypotheses on mechanistic relationships among variables. In this regard, several additional challenging aspects need to be considered, such as the inclusion of pedological knowledge in the ML algorithm or the interpretability of the calibrated ML model. Tackling these challenges is critical for ML to gain credibility and scientific consistency in soil science. We conclude that for future developments, ML could incorporate three core elements: plausibility, interpretability, and explainability, which will trigger soil scientists to couple model prediction with pedological explanation and understanding of the underlying soil processes.

However, their influence on landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) remains poorly constrained. This work determined the scale dependency of DEM-derived geomorphometric factors in LSM using a 5 m LiDAR DEM, LiDAR resampled 30 m DEM, and a 30 m ASTER DEM. To verify the validity of our approach, we first compiled an inventory map comprising of 267 landslides for Sihjhong watershed, Taiwan, from 2004 to 2014. Twelve landslide causative factors were then generated from the DEMs and ancillary data. Afterward, popular statistical and machine learning techniques, namely, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented to produce the LSM. The accuracies of models were evaluated by overall accuracy, kappa index and the receiver operating characteristic curve indicators. The highest accuracy was attained from the resampled 30 m LiDAR DEM derivatives, indicating a fine-resolution topographic data does not necessarily achieve the best performance. Additionally, RF attained superior performance between the three presented models. Our findings could contribute to opt for an appropriate DEM resolution for mapping landslide hazard in vulnerable areas.

ML methods such as convolutional neural networks show promising results and often outperform traditional methods such as empirical scoring functions in retrospective validation. However, trained ML models are often treated as black boxes and are not straightforwardly interpretable. In most cases, it is unknown which features in the data are decisive and whether a model's predictions are right for the right reason. Hence, we re-evaluated three widely used benchmark data sets in the context of ML methods and came to the conclusion that not every benchmark data set is suitable. Moreover, we demonstrate on two examples from current literature that bias is learned implicitly and unnoticed from standard benchmarks. On the basis of these results, we conclude that there is a need for eligible validation experiments and benchmark data sets suited to ML for more bias-controlled validation in ML-based SBVS. Therefore, we provide guidelines for setting up validation experiments and give a perspective on how new data sets could be generated.

Data Analytics for the Identification of Fake Reviews Using Supervised Learning	CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA			English	Article						E-commerce; fake reviews detection; methodologies; machine learning; hotel reviews	SPAM	Fake reviews, also known as deceptive opinions, are used to mislead people and have gained more importance recently. This is due to the rapid increase in online marketing transactions, such as selling and purchasing. E-commerce provides a facility for customers to post reviews and comment about the product or service when purchased. New customers usually go through the posted reviews or comments on the website before making a purchase decision. However, the current challenge is how new individuals can distinguish truthful reviews from fake ones, which later deceives customers, inflicts losses, and tarnishes the reputation of companies. The present paper attempts to develop an intelligent system that can detect fake reviews on e commerce platforms using n-grams of the review text and sentiment scores given by the reviewer. The proposed methodology adopted in this study used a standard fake hotel review dataset for experimenting and data preprocessing methods and a term frequency-Inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach for extracting features and their representation. For detection and classification, n-grams of review texts were inputted into the constructed models to be classified as fake or truthful. However, the experiments were carried out using four different supervised machine-learning techniques and were trained and tested on a dataset collected from the Trip Advisor website. The classification results of these experiments showed that naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive boosting (AB), and random forest (RF) received 88%, 93%, 94%, and 95%, respectively, based on testing accuracy and tje F1-score.

However, there is still a great gap between SNNs and the online meta-learning performance of artificial neural networks. Importantly, existing spike-based online meta-learning models do not target the robust learning based on spatio-temporal dynamics and superior machine learning theory. In this invited article, we propose a novel spike-based framework with minimum error entropy, called MeMEE, using the entropy theory to establish the gradient-based online meta-learning scheme in a recurrent SNN architecture. We examine the performance based on various types of tasks, including autonomous navigation and the working memory test. The experimental results show that the proposed MeMEE model can effectively improve the accuracy and the robustness of the spike-based meta-learning performance. More importantly, the proposed MeMEE model emphasizes the application of the modern information theoretic learning approach on the state-of-the-art spike-based learning algorithms. Therefore, in this invited paper, we provide new perspectives for further integration of advanced information theory in machine learning to improve the learning performance of SNNs, which could be of great merit to applied developments with spike-based neuromorphic systems.

J	Grote, T; Berens, P				Grote, Thomas; Berens, Philipp			On the ethics of algorithmic decision-making in healthcare	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Article							DEEP; MEDICINE; RISK	In recent years, a plethora of high-profile scientific publications has been reporting about machine learning algorithms outperforming clinicians in medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. This has spiked interest in deploying relevant algorithms with the aim of enhancing decision-making in healthcare. In this paper, we argue that instead of straightforwardly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of clinicians and healthcare institutions, deploying machines learning algorithms entails trade-offs at the epistemic and the normative level. Whereas involving machine learning might improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis, it comes at the expense of opacity when trying to assess the reliability of given diagnosis. Drawing on literature in social epistemology and moral responsibility, we argue that the uncertainty in question potentially undermines the epistemic authority of clinicians. Furthermore, we elucidate potential pitfalls of involving machine learning in healthcare with respect to paternalism, moral responsibility and fairness. At last, we discuss how the deployment of machine learning algorithms might shift the evidentiary norms of medical diagnosis. In this regard, we hope to lay the grounds for further ethical reflection of the opportunities and pitfalls of machine learning for enhancing decision-making in healthcare.

Supervised learning with quantum-enhanced feature spaces	NATURE			English	Article								Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit( 1,2) to classify the data in away similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers(3) to machine learning.

Our goal is to provide the reader with a broad understanding of the possible impact of deep learning methodologies on many aspects of ultrasound imaging. In particular, we discuss methods that lie at the interface of signal acquisition and machine learning, exploiting both data structure (e.g., sparsity in some domain) and data dimensionality (big data) already at the raw radio-frequency channel stage. As some examples, we outline efficient and effective deep learning solutions for adaptive beamforming and adaptive spectral Doppler through artificial agents, learn compressive encodings for the color Doppler, and provide a framework for structured signal recovery by learning fast approximations of iterative minimization problems, with applications to clutter suppression and super-resolution ultrasound. These emerging technologies may have a considerable impact on ultrasound imaging, showing promise across key components in the receive processing chain.	[van Sloun, Ruud J.

Traditional registration methods optimize an objective function for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for large datasets or rich deformation models. In contrast to this approach and building on recent learning-based methods, we formulate registration as a function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these images. We parameterize the function via a convolutional neural network and optimize the parameters of the neural network on a set of images. Given a new pair of scans, VoxelMorph rapidly computes a deformation field by directly evaluating the function. In this paper, we explore two different training strategies. In the first (unsupervised) setting, we train the model to maximize standard image matching objective functions that are based on the image intensities. In the second setting, we leverage auxiliary segmentations available in the training data. We demonstrate that the unsupervised model's accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods while operating orders of magnitude faster. We also show that VoxelMorph trained with auxiliary data improves registration accuracy at test time and evaluate the effect of training set size on registration. Our method promises to speed up medical image analysis and processing pipelines while facilitating novel directions in learning-based registration and its applications.

More importantly, the annotation process is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. Transfer learning was introduced to reduce the need for the annotation process by transferring the deep learning models with knowledge from a previous task and then by fine-tuning them on a relatively small dataset of the current task. Most of the methods of medical image classification employ transfer learning from pretrained models, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective. This is due to the mismatch in learned features between the natural image, e.g., ImageNet, and medical images. Additionally, it results in the utilization of deeply elaborated models. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach to overcome the previous drawbacks by means of training the deep learning model on large unlabeled medical image datasets and by next transferring the knowledge to train the deep learning model on the small amount of labeled medical images. Additionally, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model that combines recent advancements in the field. We conducted several experiments on two challenging medical imaging scenarios dealing with skin and breast cancer classification tasks. According to the reported results, it has been empirically proven that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of both classification scenarios. In terms of skin cancer, the proposed model achieved an F1-score value of 89.09% when trained from scratch and 98.53% with the proposed approach. Secondly, it achieved an accuracy value of 85.29% and 97.51%, respectively, when trained from scratch and using the proposed approach in the case of the breast cancer scenario. Finally, we concluded that our method can possibly be applied to many medical imaging problems in which a substantial amount of unlabeled image data is available and the labeled image data is limited. Moreover, it can be utilized to improve the performance of medical imaging tasks in the same domain. To do so, we used the pretrained skin cancer model to train on feet skin to classify them into two classes-either normal or abnormal (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)). It achieved an F1-score value of 86.0% when trained from scratch, 96.25% using transfer learning, and 99.25% using double-transfer learning.

The task becomes challenging, however, when it has to take account of changes in customer behavior and fraudsters' ability to invent novel fraud patterns. In this context, unsupervised learning techniques can help the fraud detection systems to find anomalies. In this paper we present a hybrid technique that combines supervised and unsupervised techniques to improve the fraud detection accuracy. Unsupervised outlier scores, computed at different levels of granularity, are compared and tested on a real, annotated, credit card fraud detection dataset. Experimental results show that the combination is efficient and does indeed improve the accuracy of the detection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Predicting the Mechanical Properties of RCA-Based Concrete Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms	MATERIALS			English	Article						mechanical properties; aggregate; concrete; compressive strength; split tensile strength; fiber	SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; RECYCLED AGGREGATE; EMISSIONS; STRENGTH; WASTE; MODEL; CEMENT; STEEL	Environment-friendly concrete is gaining popularity these days because it consumes less energy and causes less damage to the environment. Rapid increases in the population and demand for construction throughout the world lead to a significant deterioration or reduction in natural resources. Meanwhile, construction waste continues to grow at a high rate as older buildings are destroyed and demolished. As a result, the use of recycled materials may contribute to improving the quality of life and preventing environmental damage. Additionally, the application of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in concrete is essential for minimizing environmental issues. The compressive strength (CS) and splitting tensile strength (STS) of concrete containing RCA are predicted in this article using decision tree (DT) and AdaBoost machine learning (ML) techniques. A total of 344 data points with nine input variables (water, cement, fine aggregate, natural coarse aggregate, RCA, superplasticizers, water absorption of RCA and maximum size of RCA, density of RCA) were used to run the models. The data was validated using k-fold cross-validation and the coefficient correlation coefficient (R-2), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error values (RMSE). However, the model's performance was assessed using statistical checks. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was used to determine the impact of each variable on the forecasting of mechanical properties.

J	Huang, Y; Zhao, L				Huang, Yu; Zhao, Lu			Review on landslide susceptibility mapping using support vector machines	CATENA			English	Review						Landslide susceptibility assessment; Landslide susceptibility mapping; Support vector machine; Integrated tool	EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPATIAL PREDICTION MODELS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; DECISION TREE; ENSEMBLE; AREA; GIS; PROVINCE; HAZARD	Landslides are natural phenomena that can cause great loss of life and damage to property. A landslide susceptibility map is a useful tool to help with land management in landslide-prone areas. A support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that uses a small number of samples for prediction and has been widely used in recent years. This paper presents a review of landslide susceptibility mapping using SVM. It presents the basic concept of SVM and its application in landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping. Then it compares the SVM method with four other methods (analytic hierarchy process, logistic regression, artificial neural networks and random forests) used in landslide susceptibility mapping. The application of SVM in landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping is discussed and suggestions for future research are presented. Compared with some of the methods commonly used in landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping, SVM has its strengths and weaknesses owing to its unique theoretical basis. The combination of SVM and other techniques may yield better performance in landslide susceptibility assessment and mapping. A high-quality informative database is essential and classification of landslide types prior to landslide susceptibility assessment is important to help improve model performance.

J	Mahmood, A; Wang, JL				Mahmood, Asif; Wang, Jin-Liang			A time and resource efficient machine learning assisted design of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors for P3HT-based organic solar cells and green solvent selection	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							HANSEN SOLUBILITY PARAMETERS; OPEN-CIRCUIT VOLTAGE; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS; PERFORMANCE; BENZOTRIAZOLE; CANDIDATES; P3HT/PCBM; WEIGHT	The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) is increasing continuously, however, commercialization is far from being achieved due to the very high synthetic cost of materials and toxic solvents. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is the cheapest donor, however, its PCE has remained relatively low for a long time. Recently, a PCE of over 9% has been reported. This study was performed with the aim of predicting the performance of P3HT based organic solar cells through statistical data fit, bypassing the complexity of OSC devices. For this purpose, we have used machine learning to explore data from previously reported devices. Molecular descriptors were used to train machine learning models. We have identified the descriptors that have a positive impact on the PCE. Various machine learning models are used to classify non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) on the basis of their PCEs. We have also developed various regression models to predict the PCE. The support vector machine showed the best predictive capability. Machine learning models were also trained to predict the energy levels. Over 3000 NFAs were designed using high performing and easily synthesizable building blocks. For virtual screening of new molecules, energy levels were predicted through the already trained model. Acceptors with suitable energy levels matching with those of P3HT were selected. The PCEs of these selected acceptors were also predicted. 87 acceptors with >7.5% PCE were selected. Green solvents were selected on the basis of Hansen solubility parameters predicted using machine learning. Green solvent-containing organic solar cells have better scope of commercialization due to their environment-friendly nature. This study will pave the way for the cheap and fast design of materials for efficient P3HT-based organic solar cells. This study will help to select potential candidates and speed up the breakthroughs.

Arguably, Spark is the state-of-the-art in large-scale data computing systems nowadays, due to its good properties including generality, fault tolerance, high performance of in-memory data processing, and scalability. Spark adopts a flexible Resident Distributed Dataset (RDD) programming model with a set of provided transformation and action operators whose operating functions can be customized by users according to their applications. It is originally positioned as a fast and general data processing system. A large body of research efforts have been made to make it more efficient (faster) and general by considering various circumstances since its introduction. In this survey, we aim to have a thorough review of various kinds of optimization techniques on the generality and performance improvement of Spark. We introduce Spark programming model and computing system, discuss the pros and cons of Spark, and have an investigation and classification of various solving techniques in the literature. Moreover, we also introduce various data management and processing systems, machine learning algorithms and applications supported by Spark. Finally, we make a discussion on the open issues and challenges for large-scale in-memory data processing with Spark.

Therefore, an hourly rainfall forecast (HRF) model based on a supervised learning algorithm is proposed in this study to predict rainfall with high accuracy and time resolution. Hourly PWV derived from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and temperature data are used as input parameters of the HRF model, and a support vector machine is introduced to train the proposed model. In addition, this model also considers the time autocorrelation of rainfall in the previous epoch. Hourly PWV data of 21 GNSS stations and collocated meteorological parameters (temperature and rainfall) for five years in Taiwan Province are selected to validate the proposed model. Internal and external validation experiments have been performed under the cases of slight, moderate, and heavy rainfall. Average root-mean-square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE of the proposed HRF model are 1.36/1.39 mm/h and 1.00/0.67, respectively. In addition, the proposed HRF model is compared with the similar works in previous studies. Compared results reveal the satisfactory performance and superiority of the proposed HRF model in terms of time resolution and forecast accuracy.

Despite its advantages such as preserving data privacy, FL still has challenges of heterogeneity across UEs' data and physical resources. To address these challenges, we first propose FEDL, a FL algorithm which can handle heterogeneous UE data without further assumptions except strongly convex and smooth loss functions. We provide a convergence rate characterizing the trade-off between local computation rounds of each UE to update its local model and global communication rounds to update the FL global model. We then employ FEDL in wireless networks as a resource allocation optimization problem that captures the trade-off between FEDL convergence wall clock time and energy consumption of UEs with heterogeneous computing and power resources. Even though the wireless resource allocation problem of FEDL is non-convex, we exploit this problem's structure to decompose it into three sub-problems and analyze their closed-form solutions as well as insights into problem design. Finally, we empirically evaluate the convergence of FEDL with PyTorch experiments, and provide extensive numerical results for the wireless resource allocation sub-problems. Experimental results show that FEDL outperforms the vanilla FedAvg algorithm in terms of convergence rate and test accuracy in various settings.

Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.

This Article examines what sets machine learning apart from other ways of developing rules for decision-making and the problem these properties pose for explanation. We show that machine learning models can be both inscrutable and nonintuitive and that these are related, but distinct, properties. Calls for explanation have treated these problems as one and the same, but disentangling the two reveals that they demand very different responses. Dealing with inscrutability requires providing a sensible description of the rules; addressing nonintuitiveness requires providing a satisfying explanation for why the rules are what they are. Existing laws like the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as techniques within machine learning, are focused almost entirely on the problem of inscrutability. While such techniques could allow a machine learning system to comply with existing law, doing so may not help if the goal is to assess whether the basis for decision-making is normatively defensible. In most cases, intuition serves as the unacknowledged bridge between a descriptive account to a normative evaluation. But because machine learning is often valued for its ability to uncover statistical relationships that defy intuition, relying on intuition is not a satisfying approach. This Article thus argues for other mechanisms for normative evaluation. To know why the rules are what they are, one must seek explanations of the process behind a model's development, not just explanations of the model itself.

As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

J	Li, ZZ; Hoiem, D				Li, Zhizhong; Hoiem, Derek			Learning without Forgetting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Convolutional neural networks; transfer learning; multi-task learning; deep learning; visual recognition		When building a unified vision system or gradually adding new apabilities to a system, the usual assumption is that training data for all tasks is always available. However, as the number of tasks grows, storing and retraining on such data becomes infeasible. A new problem arises where we add new capabilities to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but the training data for its existing capabilities are unavailable. We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and fine-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable. A more surprising observation is that Learning without Forgetting may be able to replace fine-tuning with similar old and new task datasets for improved new task performance.

Recently, privacy-preserving deep learning has drawn tremendous attention from information security community, in which neither training data nor the training model is expected to be exposed. Federated learning is a popular learning mechanism, where multiple parties upload local gradients to a server and the server updates model parameters with the collected gradients. However, there are many security problems neglected in federated learning, for example, the participants may behave incorrectly in gradient collecting or parameter updating, and the server may be malicious as well. In this article, we present a distributed, secure, and fair deep learning framework named DeepChain to solve these problems. DeepChain provides a value-driven incentive mechanism based on Blockchain to force the participants to behave correctly. Meanwhile, DeepChain guarantees data privacy for each participant and provides auditability for the whole training process. We implement a prototype of DeepChain and conduct experiments on a real dataset for different settings, and the results show that our DeepChain is promising.

Using Deep Learning to Predict Gridded 500-hpa Geopotential Height From Historical Weather Data	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS	We develop elementary weather prediction models using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on past weather data to forecast one or two fundamental meteorological fields on a Northern Hemisphere grid with no explicit knowledge about physical processes. At forecast lead times up to 3 days, CNNs trained to predict only 500-hPa geopotential height easily outperform persistence, climatology, and the dynamics-based barotropic vorticity model, but do not beat an operational full-physics weather prediction model. These CNNs are capable of forecasting significant changes in the intensity of weather systems, which is notable because this is beyond the capability of the fundamental dynamical equation that relies solely on 500-hPa data, the barotropic vorticity equation. Modest improvements to the CNN forecasts can be made by adding 700- to 300-hPa thickness to the input data. Our best performing CNN does a good job of capturing the climatology and annual variability of 500-hPa heights and is capable of forecasting realistic atmospheric states at lead times of 14 days. Although our simple models do not perform better than an operational weather model, machine learning warrants further exploration as a weather forecasting tool; in particular, the potential efficiency of CNNs might make them attractive for ensemble forecasting.

Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) validation of image-based taxonomic identification; 2) generation of sufficient training data; 3) development of public, curated reference databases; and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.

In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available.

In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral data make the accurate classification of such data challenging for traditional machine learning methods. In addition, hyperspectral imaging often deals with an inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information and the corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized as a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems and widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those successful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify HSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic review of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares several strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main challenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by traditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep learning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework that divides the corresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks, and spectral-spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent achievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition, considering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing field are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large number of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification performance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this topic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification methods are conducted on real HSIs in our experiments.

The misdiagnosis of brain tumors will result in wrong medical intercession and reduce chance of survival of patients. The accurate diagnosis of brain tumor is a key point to make a proper treatment planning to cure and improve the existence of patients with brain tumors disease. The computer-aided tumor detection systems and convolutional neural networks provided success stories and have made important strides in the field of machine learning. The deep convolutional layers extract important and robust features automatically from the input space as compared to traditional predecessor neural network layers. In the proposed framework, we conduct three studies using three architectures of convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet) to classify brain tumors such as meningioma, glioma, and pituitary. Each study then explores the transfer learning techniques, i.e., fine-tune and freeze using MRI slices of brain tumor dataset-Figshare. The data augmentation techniques are applied to the MRI slices for generalization of results, increasing the dataset samples and reducing the chance of over-fitting. In the proposed studies, the fine-tune VGG16 architecture attained highest accuracy up to 98.69 in terms of classification and detection.

Closed-loop optimization of fast-charging protocols for batteries with machine learning	NATURE			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN; CYCLE LIFE; IMPACT	Simultaneously optimizing many design parameters in time-consuming experiments causes bottlenecks in a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines(1,2). One such example is process and control optimization for lithium-ion batteries during materials selection, cell manufacturing and operation. A typical objective is to maximize battery lifetime; however, conducting even a single experiment to evaluate lifetime can take months to years(3-5). Furthermore, both large parameter spaces and high sampling variability(3,6,7) necessitate a large number of experiments. Hence, the key challenge is to reduce both the number and the duration of the experiments required. Here we develop and demonstrate a machine learning methodology to efficiently optimize a parameter space specifying the current and voltage profiles of six-step, ten-minute fast-charging protocols for maximizing battery cycle life, which can alleviate range anxiety for electric-vehicle users(8,9). We combine two key elements to reduce the optimization cost: an early-prediction model(5), which reduces the time per experiment by predicting the final cycle life using data from the first few cycles, and a Bayesian optimization algorithm(10,11), which reduces the number of experiments by balancing exploration and exploitation to efficiently probe the parameter space of charging protocols. Using this methodology, we rapidly identify high-cycle-life charging protocols among 224 candidates in 16 days (compared with over 500 days using exhaustive search without early prediction), and subsequently validate the accuracy and efficiency of our optimization approach. Our closed-loop methodology automatically incorporates feedback from past experiments to inform future decisions and can be generalized to other applications in battery design and, more broadly, other scientific domains that involve time-intensive experiments and multi-dimensional design spaces.

Advancing methods for monitoring of environmental media (e.g., wastewater, agricultural waste, food, and water) is especially needed for identifying potential resources of novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), hot spots for gene exchange, and as pathways for the spread of ARGs and human exposure. Next-generation sequencing now enables direct access and profiling of the total metagenomic DNA pool, where ARGs are typically identified or predicted based on the "best hits" of sequence searches against existing databases. Unfortunately, this approach produces a high rate of false negatives. To address such limitations, we propose here a deep learning approach, taking into account a dissimilarity matrix created using all known categories of ARGs. Two deep learning models, DeepARG-SS and DeepARGLS, were constructed for short read sequences and full gene length sequences, respectively. Results: Evaluation of the deep learning models over 30 antibiotic resistance categories demonstrates that the DeepARG models can predict ARGs with both high precision (> 0.97) and recall (> 0.90). The models displayed an advantage over the typical best hit approach, yielding consistently lower false negative rates and thus higher overall recall (> 0.9). As more data become available for under-represented ARG categories, the DeepARG models' performance can be expected to be further enhanced due to the nature of the underlying neural networks. Our newly developed ARG database, DeepARG-DB, encompasses ARGs predicted with a high degree of confidence and extensive manual inspection, greatly expanding current ARG repositories. Conclusions: The deep learning models developed here offer more accurate antimicrobial resistance annotation relative to current bioinformatics practice. DeepARG does not require strict cutoffs, which enables identification of a much broader diversity of ARGs. The DeepARG models and database are available as a command line version and as a Web service at http://bench.cs.vt.edu/deeparg.

J	Liu, X; Liu, YW; Chen, Y				Liu, Xiao; Liu, Yuanwei; Chen, Yue			Machine Learning Empowered Trajectory and Passive Beamforming Design in UAV-RIS Wireless Networks	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Heuristic algorithms; Array signal processing; Wireless networks; Trajectory; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Resource management; Decoding; Non-orthogonal multiple access; reconfigurable intelligent surfaces; reinforcement learning; trajectory design; unmanned aerial vehicle	NONORTHOGONAL MULTIPLE-ACCESS; INTELLIGENT	A novel framework is proposed for integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled wireless networks, where an RIS is deployed for enhancing the service quality of the UAV. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is invoked to further improve the spectrum efficiency of the network, while mobile users (MUs) are considered as roaming continuously. The energy consumption minimizing problem is formulated by jointly designing the movement of the UAV, phase shifts of the RIS, power allocation policy from the UAV to MUs, as well as determining the dynamic decoding order. A decaying deep Q-network (D-DQN) based algorithm is proposed for tackling this pertinent problem. In the proposed D-DQN based algorithm, the central controller is selected as an agent for periodically observing the state of UAV-enabled wireless network and for carrying out actions to adapt to the dynamic environment. In contrast to the conventional DQN algorithm, the decaying learning rate is leveraged in the proposed D-DQN based algorithm for attaining a tradeoff between accelerating training speed and converging to the local optimal. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) In contrast to the conventional Q-learning algorithm, which cannot converge when being adopted for solving the formulated problem, the proposed D-DQN based algorithm is capable of converging with minor constraints; 2) The energy dissipation of the UAV can be significantly reduced by integrating RISs in UAV-enabled wireless networks; 3) By designing the dynamic decoding order and power allocation policy, the RIS-NOMA case consumes 11.7% less energy than the RIS-OMA case.

An Advanced Machine Learning Based Energy Management of Renewable Microgrids Considering Hybrid Electric Vehicles' Charging Demand	ENERGIES			English	Article						renewable microgrids; hybrid electric vehicle; optimization; energy management; remote switching and automation	WIND ENERGY; INTEGRATION; GENERATION; ALGORITHM; MODEL; SOLAR	Renewable microgrids are new solutions for enhanced security, improved reliability and boosted power quality and operation in power systems. By deploying different sources of renewables such as solar panels and wind units, renewable microgrids can enhance reducing the greenhouse gasses and improve the efficiency. This paper proposes a machine learning based approach for energy management in renewable microgrids considering a reconfigurable structure based on remote switching of tie and sectionalizing. The suggested method considers the advanced support vector machine for modeling and estimating the charging demand of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In order to mitigate the charging effects of HEVs on the system, two different scenarios are deployed; one coordinated and the other one intelligent charging. Due to the complex structure of the problem formulation, a new modified optimization method based on dragonfly is suggested. Moreover, a self-adaptive modification is suggested, which helps the solutions pick the modification method that best fits their situation. Simulation results on an IEEE microgrid test system show its appropriate and efficient quality in both scenarios. According to the prediction results for the total charging demand of the HEVs, the mean absolute percentage error is 0.978, which is very low. Moreover, the results show a 2.5% reduction in the total operation cost of the microgrid in the intelligent charging compared to the coordinated scheme.

When the training and testing data are from different distributions, domain adaptation approaches have been introduced. However, the existing methods generally assume the availability of the target-domain data in all the health conditions during training, which is not in accordance with the real industrial scenarios. This article proposes a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method to address the partial domain adaptation problems, where the unsupervised target-domain training data do not cover the full machine health state label space. The conditional data alignment and unsupervised prediction consistency schemes are proposed to achieve partial domain adaptation. The experimental results on two rotating machinery datasets suggest the proposed method offers a promising tool for this practical industrial problem.

A Machine Learning based analysis	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: abundances; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: fundamental parameters; galaxies: ISM	H-II REGIONS; SDSS-IV MANGA; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; DIFFUSE IONIZED-GAS; MOSDEF-LRIS SURVEY; TO-OXYGEN RATIO; MILKY-WAY; METALLICITY RELATION; CHEMICAL ABUNDANCES; NEBULAR EMISSION	We investigate which physical properties are most predictive of the position of local star forming galaxies on the BPT diagrams, by means of different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Exploiting the large statistics from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we define a framework in which the deviation of star-forming galaxies from their median sequence can be described in terms of the relative variations in a variety of observational parameters. We train artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF) trees to predict whether galaxies are offset above or below the sequence (via classification), and to estimate the exact magnitude of the offset itself (via regression). We find, with high significance, that parameters primarily associated to variations in the nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance ratio (N/O) are the most predictive for the [N ii]-BPT diagram, whereas properties related to star formation (like variations in SFR or EW(H alpha)) perform better in the [S ii]-BPT diagram. We interpret the former as a reflection of the N/O-O/H relationship for local galaxies, while the latter as primarily tracing the variation in the effective size of the S+ emitting region, which directly impacts the [S ii] emission lines. This analysis paves the way to assess to what extent the physics shaping local BPT diagrams is also responsible for the offsets seen in high redshift galaxies or, instead, whether a different framework or even different mechanisms need to be invoked.

However, security and privacy concerns (e.g., data leakage) are major obstacles for data providers to share their data in wireless networks. The leakage of private data can lead to serious issues beyond financial loss for the providers. In this article, we first design a blockchain empowered secure data sharing architecture for distributed multiple parties. Then, we formulate the data sharing problem into a machine-learning problem by incorporating privacy-preserved federated learning. The privacy of data is well-maintained by sharing the data model instead of revealing the actual data. Finally, we integrate federated learning in the consensus process of permissioned blockchain, so that the computing work for consensus can also be used for federated training. Numerical results derived from real-world datasets show that the proposed data sharing scheme achieves good accuracy, high efficiency, and enhanced security.

Analyzing these networks sheds light on different aspects of social life such as the structure of societies, information diffusion, and communication patterns. In reality, however, the large scale of information networks often makes network analytic tasks computationally expensive or intractable. Network representation learning has been recently proposed as a new learning paradigm to embed network vertices into a low-dimensional vector space, by preserving network topology structure, vertex content, and other side information. This facilitates the original network to be easily handled in the new vector space for further analysis. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the current literature on network representation learning in the data mining and machine learning field. We propose new taxonomies to categorize and summarize the state-of-the-art network representation learning techniques according to the underlying learning mechanisms, the network information intended to preserve, as well as the algorithmic designs and methodologies. We summarize evaluation protocols used for validating network representation learning including published benchmark datasets, evaluation methods, and open source algorithms. We also perform empirical studies to compare the performance of representative algorithms on common datasets, and analyze their computational complexity. Finally, we suggest promising research directions to facilitate future study.

J	Han, JW; Cheng, G; Li, ZP; Zhang, DW				Han, Junwei; Cheng, Gong; Li, Zhenpeng; Zhang, Dingwen			A Unified Metric Learning-Based Framework for Co-Saliency Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Co-saliency detection; metric learning; feature learning	OBJECT DETECTION; DEEP; SELECTION	Co-saliency detection, which focuses on extracting commonly salient objects in a group of relevant images, has been attracting research interest because of its broad applications. In practice, the relevant images in a group may have a wide range of variations, and the salient objects may also have large appearance changes. Such wide variations usually bring about large intra-co-salient objects (intra-COs) diversity and high similarity between COs and background, which makes the co-saliency detection task more difficult. To address these problems, we make the earliest effort to introduce metric learning to co-saliency detection. Specifically, we propose a unified metric learning-based framework to jointly learn discriminative feature representation and co-salient object detector. This is achieved by optimizing a new objective function that explicitly embeds a metric learning regularization term into support vector machine (SVM) training. Here, the metric learning regularization term is used to learn a powerful feature representation that has small intra-COs scatter, but big separation between background and COs and the SVM classifier is used for subsequent co-saliency detection. In the experiments, we comprehensively evaluate the proposed method on two commonly used benchmark data sets. The state-of-the-art results are achieved in comparison with the existing co-saliency detection methods.

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) three-dimensional printing (3DP) has made significant advancements in the field of oral drug delivery with personalized drug-loaded formulations being designed, developed and dispensed for the needs of the patient. The FDM 3DP process begins with the production of drug-loaded filaments by hot melt extrusion (HME), followed by the printing of a drug product using a FDM 3D printer. However, the optimization of the fabrication parameters is a time-consuming, empirical trial approach, requiring expert knowledge. Here, M3DISEEN, a web-based pharmaceutical software, was developed to accelerate FDM 3D printing using AI machine learning techniques (MLTs). In total, 614 drug-loaded formulations were designed from a comprehensive list of 145 different pharmaceutical excipients, 3D printed and assessed in-house. To build the predictive tool, a dataset was constructed and models were trained and tested at a ratio of 75:25. Significantly, the AI models predicted key fabrication parameters with accuracies of 76% and 67% for the printability and the filament characteristics, respectively. Furthermore, the AI models predicted the HME and FDM processing temperatures with a mean absolute error of 8.9 degrees C and 8.3 degrees C, respectively. Strikingly, the AI models achieved high levels of accuracy by solely inputting the pharmaceutical excipient trade names. Therefore, AI provides an effective holistic modeling technology and software to streamline and advance 3DP as a significant technology within drug development.

The fact that the disease diagnosis process is slow to perform manually and another fact that the success of the diagnosis is proportional to the pathologist's capabilities makes this problem an excellent application area for computer aided diagnostic systems. Instead of classical machine learning methods, in which manual feature extraction should be flawless to achieve successful results, there is a need for a model that does not need pre-processing and can perform a successful classification. In this study, EfficientNet deep learning architecture was proposed in plant leaf disease classification and the performance of this model was compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning models. The PlantVillage dataset was used to train models. All the models were trained with original and augmented datasets having 55,448 and 61,486 images, respectively. EfficientNet architecture and other deep learning models were trained using transfer learning approach. In the transfer learning, all layers of the models were set to be trainable. The results obtained in the test dataset showed that B5 and B4 models of EfficientNet architecture achieved the highest values compared to other deep learning models in original and augmented datasets with 99.91% and 99.97% respectively for accuracy and 98.42% and 99.39% respectively for precision.

Identifying 6mA sites in rice genome is important in rice epigenetics and breeding, but non-random distribution and biological functions of these sites remain unclear. Several machine-learning tools can identify 6mA sites but show limited prediction accuracy, which limits their usability in epigenetic research. Here, we developed a novel computational predictor, called the Sequence-based DNA N-6-methyladenine predictor (SDM6A), which is a two-layer ensemble approach for identifying 6mA sites in the rice genome. Unlike existing methods, which are based on single models with basic features, SDM6A explores various features, and five encoding methods were identified as appropriate for this problem. Subsequently, an optimal feature set was identified from encodings, and corresponding models were developed individually using support vector machine and extremely randomized tree. First, all five single models were integrated via ensemble approach to define the class for each classifier. Second, two classifiers were integrated to generate a final prediction. SDM6A achieved robust performance on cross-validation and independent evaluation, with average accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 88.2% and 0.764, respectively. Corresponding metrics were 4.7%-11.0% and 2.3%-5.5% higher than those of existing methods, respectively. A user-friendly, publicly accessible web server (http://thegleelab.org/SDM6A) was implemented to predict novel putative 6mA sites in rice genome.

J	Hagendorff, T				Hagendorff, Thilo			The Ethics of AI Ethics: An Evaluation of Guidelines	MINDS AND MACHINES			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Ethics; Guidelines; Implementation	DIGITAL LABOR; INGROUP; SCIENCE	Current advances in research, development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have yielded a far-reaching discourse on AI ethics. In consequence, a number of ethics guidelines have been released in recent years. These guidelines comprise normative principles and recommendations aimed to harness the "disruptive" potentials of new AI technologies. Designed as a semi-systematic evaluation, this paper analyzes and compares 22 guidelines, highlighting overlaps but also omissions. As a result, I give a detailed overview of the field of AI ethics. Finally, I also examine to what extent the respective ethical principles and values are implemented in the practice of research, development and application of AI systems-and how the effectiveness in the demands of AI ethics can be improved.

Iran has been among the most devastated regions affected by the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM) methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models (accuracy = 90-92%, Kappa = 79-84%, Success ratio = 94-96%, Threat score = 80-84%, and Heidke skill score = 79-84%). The variables of distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce regions.

Smartphones can measure PD features, yet no smartphone-derived rating score exists to assess motor symptom severity in real-world settings. OBJECTIVES To develop an objective measure of PD severity and test construct validity by evaluating the ability of the measure to capture intraday symptom fluctuations, correlate with current standard PD outcome measures, and respond to dopaminergic therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study assessed individuals with PD who remotely completed 5 tasks (voice, finger tapping, gait, balance, and reaction time) on the smartphone application. We used a novel machine-learning-based approach to generate a mobile Parkinson disease score (mPDS) that objectively weighs features derived from each smartphone activity (eg, stride length from the gait activity) and is scaled from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate greater severity). Individuals with and without PD additionally completed standard in-person assessments of PD with smartphone assessments during a period of 6 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ability of the mPDS to detect intraday symptom fluctuations, the correlation between the mPDS and standard measures, and the ability of the mPDS to respond to dopaminergic medication. RESULTS The mPDS was derived from 6148 smartphone activity assessments from 129 individuals (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [8.6] years; 56 [43.4%] women). Gait features contributed most to the total mPDS (33.4%). In addition, 23 individuals with PD (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [11.5] years; 11 [48%] women) and 17 without PD (mean [SD] age 54.2 [16.5] years; 12 [71%] women) completed in-clinic assessments. The mPDS detected symptom fluctuations with a mean (SD) intraday change of 13.9 (10.3) points on a scale of 0 to 100. The measure correlated well with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease's Rating Scale total (r = 0.81; P < .001) and part III only (r = 0.88; P < .001), the Timed Up and Go assessment (r = 0.72; P = .002), and the Hoehn and Yahr stage (r = 0.91; P < .001). The mPDS improved by a mean (SD) of 16.3 (5.6) points in response to dopaminergic therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using a novel machine-learning approach, we created and demonstrated construct validity of an objective PD severity score derived from smartphone assessments. This score complements standard PD measures by providing frequent, objective, real-world assessments that could enhance clinical care and evaluation of novel therapeutics.

There is a need for risk stratification tools to inform personalized functional-disability preventive strategies for individuals in at-risk and early phases of these illnesses. OBJECTIVE To determine whether predictors associated with social and role functioning can be identified in patients in clinical high-risk (CHR) states for psychosis or with recent-onset depression (ROD) using clinical, imaging-based, and combined machine learning; assess the geographic, transdiagnostic, and prognostic generalizability of machine learning and compare it with human prognostication; and explore sequential prognosis encompassing clinical and combined machine learning. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multisite naturalistic study followed up patients in CHR states, with ROD, and with recent-onset psychosis, and healthy control participants for 18 months in 7 academic early-recognition services in 5 European countries. Participants were recruited between February 2014 and May 2016, and data were analyzed from April 2017 to January 2018. AIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Performance and generalizability of prognostic models. RESULTS A total of 116 individuals in CHR states (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [5.1] years; 58 [50.0%] female) and 120 patients with ROD (mean [SD] age, 26.1 [6.1] years; 65 [54.2%] female) were followed up for a mean (SD) of 329 (142) days. Machine learning predicted the 1-year social-functioning outcomes with a balanced accuracy of 76.9% of patients in CHR states and 66.2% of patients with ROD using clinical baseline data. Balanced accuracy in models using structural neuroimaging was 76.2% in patients in CHR states and 65.0% in patients with ROD, and in combined models, it was 82.7% for CHR states and 70.3% for ROD. Lower functioning before study entry was a transdiagnostic predictor. Medial prefrontal and temporo-parieto-occipital gray matter volume (GMV) reductions and cerebellar and dorsolateral prefrontal GMV increments had predictive value in the CHR group; reduced mediotemporal and increased prefrontal-perisylvian GMV had predictive value in patients with ROD. Poor prognoses were associated with increased risk of psychotic, depressive, and anxiety disorders at follow-up in patients in the CHR state but not ones with ROD. Machine learning outperformed expert prognostication.

On the other hand, while smart cities bring better life experiences and great convenience to people?s lives, there are more hidden dangers of cyber security, including information leakage and malicious cyber attacks. The current cyber security development cannot keep up with the eager adoption of global smart city technologies so correct design based on deep learning methods is essential to protect smart city cyber. This paper summarizes the knowledge and interpretation of Smart Cities (SC), Cyber Security (CS), and Deep Learning (DL) concepts as well as discussed existing related work on IoT security in smart cities. Specifically, we briefly reviewed several deep learning models, including Boltzmann machines, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. Then we introduced cyber security applications and use cases based on deep learning technology in smart cities. Finally, we describe the future development trend of smart city cyber security.

Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.

GOA is a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the swarming behavior of grasshoppers. This algorithm is proved to be efficient in solving global unconstrained and constrained optimization problems. However, the original GOA has some drawbacks, such as easy to fall into local optimum and slow convergence speed. To overcome these shortcomings, an improved GOA which combines three strategies to achieve a more suitable balance between exploitation and exploration was established. Firstly, Gaussian mutation is employed to increase population diversity, which can make GOA has stronger local search ability. Then, Levy-flight strategy was adopted to enhance the randomness of the search agent's movement, which can make GOA have a stronger global exploration capability. Furthermore, opposition-based learning was introduced into GOA for more efficient search solution space. Based on the improved GOA, an effective kernel extreme learning machine model was developed for financial stress prediction. As the experimental results show, the three strategies can significantly boost the performance of GOA and the proposed learning scheme can guarantee a more stable kernel extreme learning machine model with higher predictive performance compared to others.

Manual classification is time-consuming, expensive, and requires experienced experts who are often limited available. To cope with these issues, various machine learning algorithms have been proposed to support the automated classification of plant species. Among these machine learning algorithms, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied to different data sets. DNNs have been however often applied in isolation and no effort has been made to reuse and transfer the knowledge of different applications of DNNs. Transfer learning in the context of machine learning implies the usage of the results of multiple applications of DNNs. In this article, the results of the effect of four different transfer learning models for deep neural network-based plant classification is investigated on four public datasets. Our experimental study demonstrates that transfer learning can provide important benefits for automated plant identification and can improve low-performance plant classification models.

While promising diagnostic performance has been achieved, the existing methods generally require large amounts of high-quality supervised data for training, which are mostly difficult and expensive to collect in real industries. Therefore, it is motivated that the distributed data of multiple clients can be integrated and exploited to build a powerful data-driven model. However, that basically requires data sharing among different users, and is not preferred in most industrial cases due to potential conflict of interests. In order to address the data island problem, a federated learning method for machinery fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. Model training is locally implemented within each participated client, and a self-supervised learning scheme is proposed to enhance the learning performance. The server aggregates the locally updated models in each training round under the dynamic validation scheme, and a global fault diagnosis model can be established. Only the models are mutually communicated rather than the data, which ensures data privacy among different clients.

In this work, three MLPs of tobermorite (9, 11, and 14 angstrom) are respectively constructed by Deep Potential (DP) method. Accuracy assessments of each MLP are performed via MD computations of lattice constants, radial and angular distribution function, mean square displacement and elastic properties. Results using MLPs are highly consistent with those obtained from ab initio MD simulations, while with respect to efficiency, MLPs are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, three MLPs are integrated and extended to the calcium silica hydrates system, and the calculated structure and mechanical properties show good agreement with experimental results. It proves the introduction of MLPs is feasible for larger scale MD simulations on cement-based materials with higher accuracy.

These methods include Asymmetry, Border, Color and Diameter (ABCD) method, seven-point detection method, Menzies method, and pattern analysis. They are used regularly by doctors for cancer diagnosis, although they are not considered very efficient for obtaining better performance. Moreover, considering all types of audience, the basic evaluation criteria are also discussed. The criteria include the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve), Area under the ROC curve (AUC), F1 score, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, dice-coefficient, average accuracy, and Jaccard index. Previously used methods are considered inefficient, asking for better and smarter methods for cancer diagnosis. Artificial intelligence and cancer diagnosis are gaining attention as a way to define better diagnostic tools. In particular, deep neural networks can be successfully used for intelligent image analysis. The basic framework of how this machine learning works on medical imaging is provided in this study, i.e., pre-processing, image segmentation and post-processing. The second part of this manuscript describes the different deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial models (GANs), deep autoencoders (DANs), restricted Boltzmann's machine (RBM), stacked autoencoders (SAE), convolutional autoencoders (CAE), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LTSM), multi-scale convolutional neural network (M-CNN), multi-instance learning convolutional neural network (MIL-CNN). For each technique, we provide Python codes, to allow interested readers to experiment with the cited algorithms on their own diagnostic problems. The third part of this manuscript compiles the successfully applied deep learning models for different types of cancers. Considering the length of the manuscript, we restrict ourselves to the discussion of breast cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, and skin cancer. The purpose of this bibliographic review is to provide researchers opting to work in implementing deep learning and artificial neural networks for cancer diagnosis a knowledge from scratch of the state-of-the-art achievements.

Specifically, we approximate the unknown solution as well as the nonlinear dynamics by two deep neural networks. The first network acts as a prior on the unknown solution and essentially enables us to avoid numerical differentiations which are inherently ill-conditioned and unstable. The second network represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given spatiotemporal data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems spanning a number of scientific domains and demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us accurately learn the underlying dynamics and forecast future states of the system. In particular, we study the Burgers', Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Quantum circuit learning	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							SYSTEMS	We propose a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm for machine learning on near-term quantum processors, which we call quantum circuit learning. A quantum circuit driven by our framework learns a given task by tuning parameters implemented on it. The iterative optimization of the parameters allows us to circumvent the high-depth circuit. Theoretical investigation shows that a quantum circuit can approximate nonlinear functions, which is further confirmed by numerical simulations. Hybridizing a low-depth quantum circuit and a classical computer formachine learning, the proposed framework paves the way toward applications of near-term quantum devices for quantum machine learning.

J	Le, TT; Fu, WX; Moore, JH				Le, Trang T.; Fu, Weixuan; Moore, Jason H.			Scaling tree-based automated machine learning to biomedical big data with a feature set selector	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							MAJOR DEPRESSION; APOPTOSIS	Motivation Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems are helpful data science assistants designed to scan data for novel features, select appropriate supervised learning models and optimize their parameters. For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was developed using strongly typed genetic programing (GP) to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientist's prediction problem. However, like other AutoML systems, TPOT may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data. Results We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the system's scalability: Feature Set Selector (FSS) and Template. FSS provides the option to specify subsets of the features as separate datasets, assuming the signals come from one or more of these specific data subsets. FSS increases TPOT's efficiency in application on big data by slicing the entire dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing GP to select the best subset in the final pipeline. Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed GP and enables the incorporation of FSS at the beginning of each pipeline. Consequently, FSS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and may provide more interpretable results. Our simulations show TPOT-FSS significantly outperforms a tuned XGBoost model and standard TPOT implementation. We apply TPOT-FSS to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder. Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of two modules, TPOT-FSS corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual. Availability and implementation Detailed simulation and analysis code needed to reproduce the results in this study is available at https://github.com/lelaboratoire/tpot-fss.

EEG based multi-class seizure type classification using convolutional neural network and transfer learning	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Convolution neural network; Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Seizure type; Support vector machine; Transfer learning	SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ILAE COMMISSION; POSITION PAPER; LOG ENERGY; ENTROPY; RECOGNITION; MODEL	Recognition of epileptic seizure type is essential for the neurosurgeon to understand the cortical connectivity of the brain. Though automated early recognition of seizures from normal electroencephalogram (EEG) was existing, no attempts have been made towards the classification of variants of seizures. Therefore, this study attempts to classify seven variants of seizures with non-seizure EEG through the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning by making use of the Temple University Hospital EEG corpus. The objective of our study is to perform a multiclass classification of epileptic seizure type, which includes simple partial, complex partial, focal non-specific, generalized non-specific, absence, tonic, and tonic-clonic, and non-seizures. The 19 channels EEG time series was converted into a spectrogram stack before feeding as input to CNN. The following two different modalities were proposed using CNN: (1) Transfer learning using pretrained network, (2) Extract image features using pretrained network and classify using the support vector machine classifier. The following ten pretrained networks were used to identify the optimal network for the proposed study: Alexnet, Vgg16, Vgg19, Squeezenet, Googlenet, Inceptionv3, Densenet201, Resnetl8, Resnet50, and Resnet101. The highest classification accuracy of 82.85% (using Googlenet) and 88.30% (using Inceptionv3) was achieved using transfer learning and extract image features approach respectively. Comparison results showed that CNN based approach outperformed conventional feature and clustering based approaches. It can be concluded that the EEG based classification of seizure type using CNN model could be used in pre-surgical evaluation for treating patients with epilepsy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The key challenge in MR images classification is the semantic gap between the low-level visual information captured by the MRI machine and the high-level information perceived by the human evaluator. The traditional machine learning techniques for classification focus only on low-level or high-level features, use some handcrafted features to reduce this gap and require good feature extraction and classification methods. Recent development on deep learning has shown great progress and deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) have succeeded in the images classification task. Deep learning is very powerful for feature representation that can depict low-level and high-level information completely and embed the phase of feature extraction and classification into self-learning but require large training dataset in general. For most of the medical imaging scenario, the training datasets are small, therefore, it is a challenging task to apply the deep learning and train CNN from scratch on the small dataset. Aiming this problem, we use pre-trained deep CNN model and propose a block-wise fine-tuning strategy based on transfer learning. The proposed method is evaluated on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (CE-MRI) benchmark dataset. Our method is more generic as it does not use any handcrafted features, requires minimal preprocessing and can achieve average accuracy of 94.82% under five-fold cross-validation. We compare our results not only with the traditional machine learning but also with deep learning methods using CNNs. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art classification on the CE-MRI dataset. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding the behaviour of artificial intelligence systems is essential to our ability to control their actions, reap their benefits and minimize their harms. Here we argue that this necessitates a broad scientific research agenda to study machine behaviour that incorporates and expands upon the discipline of computer science and includes insights from across the sciences. We first outline a set of questions that are fundamental to this emerging field and then explore the technical, legal and institutional constraints on the study of machine behaviour.

Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, have successfully become part of the organic chemists' daily laboratory, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, the prediction of reaction yields has received less attention in spite of the enormous potential of accurately predicting reaction conversion rates. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants converted to the desired products, could guide chemists and help them select high-yielding reactions and score synthesis routes, reducing the number of attempts. So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for high-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants, concatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors. Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the data set applicability in reaction yields predictions.

The success of NIDS is highly dependent on the performance of the algorithms and improvement methods used to increase the classification accuracy and decrease the training and testing times of the algorithms. We propose an effective deep learning approach, self-taught learning (STL)-IDS, based on the STL framework. The proposed approach is used for feature learning and dimensionality reduction. It reduces training and testing time considerably and effectively improves the prediction accuracy of support vector machines (SVM) with regard to attacks. The proposed model is built using the sparse autoencoder mechanism, which is an effective learning algorithm for reconstructing a new feature representation in an unsupervised manner. After the pre-training stage, the new features are fed into the SVM algorithm to improve its detection capability for intrusion and classification accuracy. Moreover, the efficiency of the approach in binary and multiclass classification is studied and compared with that of shallow classification methods, such as J48, naive Bayesian, random forest, and SVM. Results show that our approach has accelerated SVM training and testing times and performed better than most of the previous approaches in terms of performance metrics in binary and multiclass classification. The proposed STL-IDS approach improves network intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection.

Many deep learning-based procedures worked out so far to classify images may have some ill-posed issues. The performance of the classification scheme depends on the range of captured images, the volume of features, types of characters, choice of features from extracted features, and type of classifiers used. This paper aims to propose a novel deep learning approach consisting of Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) application to classify the fruit images. Classification accuracy depends on the extracted and selected optimal features. Deep learning applications CNN, RNN, and LSTM were collectively involved to classify the fruits. CNN is used to extract the image features. RNN is used to select the extracted optimal features and LSTM is used to classify the fruits based on extracted and selected images features by CNN and RNN. Empirical study shows the supremacy of proposed over existing Support Vector Machine (SVM), Feed-forward Neural Network (FFNN), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) competitive techniques for fruit images classification. The accuracy rate of the proposed approach is quite better than the SVM, FFNN, and ANFIS schemes. It has been concluded that the proposed technique outperforms existing schemes.

Nevertheless, the implementation of large datasets generated by high-throughput phenotyping tools such as hyperspectral reflectance in cultivar development programs is still challenging due to the essential need for intensive knowledge in computational and statistical analyses. In this study, the robustness of three common machine learning (ML) algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were evaluated for predicting soybean (Glycine max) seed yield using hyperspectral reflectance. For this aim, the hyperspectral reflectance data for the whole spectra ranged from 395 to 1005 nm, which were collected at the R4 and R5 growth stages on 250 soybean genotypes grown in four environments. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral reflectance data and select variables with the largest importance values. The results indicated that R5 is more informative stage for measuring hyperspectral reflectance to predict seed yields. The 395 nm reflectance band was also identified as the high ranked band in predicting the soybean seed yield. By considering either full or selected variables as the input variables, the ML algorithms were evaluated individually and combined-version using the ensemble-stacking (E-S) method to predict the soybean yield. The RF algorithm had the highest performance with a value of 84% yield classification accuracy among all the individual tested algorithms. Therefore, by selecting RF as the metaClassifier for E-S method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93, using all variables, and 0.87, using selected variables showing the success of using E-S as one of the ensemble techniques. This study demonstrated that soybean breeders could implement E-S algorithm using either the full or selected spectra reflectance to select the high-yielding soybean genotypes, among a large number of genotypes, at early growth stages.

Learning data-driven discretizations for partial differential equations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						coarse graining; machine learning; computational physics	APPROXIMATE INERTIAL MANIFOLDS; IDENTIFICATION	The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is challenging because of the need to resolve spatiotemporal features over wide length- and timescales. Often, it is computationally intractable to resolve the finest features in the solution. The only recourse is to use approximate coarse-grained representations, which aim to accurately represent long-wavelength dynamics while properly accounting for unresolved small-scale physics. Deriving such coarse-grained equations is notoriously difficult and often ad hoc. Here we introduce data-driven discretization, a method for learning optimized approximations to PDEs based on actual solutions to the known underlying equations. Our approach uses neural networks to estimate spatial derivatives, which are optimized end to end to best satisfy the equations on a low-resolution grid. The resulting numerical methods are remarkably accurate, allowing us to integrate in time a collection of nonlinear equations in 1 spatial dimension at resolutions 4x to 8x coarser than is possible with standard finite-difference methods.

Recent studies reveal that deep neural networks can learn transferable features that generalize well to similar novel tasks. However, as deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the network, feature transferability drops significantly in higher task-specific layers with increasing domain discrepancy. To formally reduce the effects of this discrepancy and enhance feature transferability in task-specific layers, we develop a novel framework for deep adaptation networks that extends deep convolutional neural networks to domain adaptation problems. The framework embeds the deep features of all task-specific layers into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) and optimally matches different domain distributions. The deep features are made more transferable by exploiting low-density separation of target-unlabeled data in very deep architectures, while the domain discrepancy is further reduced via the use of multiple kernel learning that enhances the statistical power of kernel embedding matching. The overall framework is cast in a minimax game setting. Extensive empirical evidence shows that the proposed networks yield state-of-the-art results on standard visual domain-adaptation benchmarks.

The core of our framework is to devise an unbiased and statistically efficient risk estimator that is applicable to various weak supervision. Specifically, by decomposing the loss function (e.g., the squared loss and hinge loss) into a label-independent term and a label-dependent term, we discover that only the latter is influenced by the weak supervision and is related to the centroid of the entire dataset. Therefore, by constructing two auxiliary pseudo-labeled datasets with synthesized labels, we derive unbiased estimates of centroid based on the two auxiliary datasets, respectively. These two estimates are further linearly combined with a properly decided coefficient which makes the final combined estimate not only unbiased but also statistically efficient. This is better than some existing methods that only care about the unbiasedness of estimation but ignore the statistical efficiency. The good statistical efficiency of the derived estimator is guaranteed as we theoretically prove that it acquires the minimum variance when estimating the centroid. As a result, intensive experimental results on a large number of benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CEGE generally obtains better performance than the existing approaches related to typical WSL problems including semi-supervised learning, positive-unlabeled learning, multiple instance learning, and label noise learning.

Adsorption of antibiotics on carbon-based materials (CBMs) such as biochar and activated carbon was recognized as one of the most promising technologies for wastewater treatment. This study applied machine learning (ML) methods to develop generic prediction models of tetracycline (TC) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) adsorption on CBMs. The results suggested that random forest outperformed gradient boosting trees and artificial neural network for both TC and SMX adsorption models. The random forest models could accurately predict the adsorption capacity of antibiotics on CBMs using material properties and adsorption conditions as model inputs. The developed ML models presented better generalization ability than traditional isotherm models under variable environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, solution pH) and adsorbent types. The relative importance analysis and partial dependence plots based on ML models were performed to compare TC and SMX adsorption on CBMs. The results indicated the critical role of specific surface area for both TC (24%) and SMX (45%) adsorption, while the other material properties (e.g., H/C, (O + N)/C, pH(pzc)) showed variable influences due to the differences in molecular structures, functional groups, and pKa values of TC and SMX. The accurate ML prediction models with generalization ability are useful for designing efficient CBMs with minimal experimental screening, while the relative importance and partial dependence plot analysis can guide rational applications of CBMs for antibiotics wastewater treatment.

The primary role of the distance between metal ions in different compounds is revealed, and the influence of other structural features such as metal-halogen distance and the distortion of metal-halogen polyhedrons are quantified. Accordingly, the two previously unknown Sb3+-based zero-dimensional metal halides were synthesized to verify the obtained model. Experimental studies of the two compounds demonstrated good agreement with the predictions, and the PLQY of (C10H16N)(2)SbCl5 is found to be 96.5%. Via machine learning analysis, we demonstrate that concentration quenching is the main factor that determines PLQY for all s(2) ion metal halides, which will accelerate the discovery of new luminescence metal halides.

Bail decisions provide a good test case. Millions of times each year, judges make jail-or-release decisions that hinge on a prediction of what a defendant would do if released. The concreteness of the prediction task combined with the volume of data available makes this a promising machine-learning application. Yet comparing the algorithm to judges proves complicated. First, the available data are generated by prior judge decisions. We only observe crime outcomes for released defendants, not for those judges detained. This makes it hard to evaluate counterfactual decision rules based on algorithmic predictions. Second, judges may have a broader set of preferences than the variable the algorithm predicts; for instance, judges may care specifically about violent crimes or about racial inequities. We deal with these problems using different econometric strategies, such as quasi-random assignment of cases to judges. Even accounting for these concerns, our results suggest potentially large welfare gains: one policy simulation shows crime reductions up to 24.7% with no change in jailing rates, or jailing rate reductions up to 41.9% with no increase in crime rates. Moreover, all categories of crime, including violent crimes, show reductions; these gains can be achieved while simultaneously reducing racial disparities. These results suggest that while machine learning can be valuable, realizing this value requires integrating these tools into an economic framework: being clear about the link between predictions and decisions; specifying the scope of payoff functions; and constructing unbiased decision counterfactuals.

A widespread database comprising 216 experimental records was constructed from available research. The database includes depth of wear as a response parameter and nine different explanatory variables, i.e., cement content, fly ash, water content, fine and coarse aggregate, plasticizer, air-entraining agent, age of concrete, and time of testing. The performance of the models was judged via statistical metrics. The GEP model gives better performance with R-2 and rho equals 0.9667 and 0.0501 respectively and meet with the external validation criterion suggested in the previous literature. The k-fold cross-validation also verifies the accurateness of the model by evaluating R-2, RSE, MAE, and RMSE. The sensitivity analysis of GEP equation indicated that the time of testing is the influential parameter. The results of this research can help the designers, practitioners, and researchers to quickly estimate the depth of wear of fly-ash concrete thus shortening its ecological susceptibilities that push to sustainable and faster construction from the viewpoint of environmentally friendly waste management.

We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a "Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)" since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions.

The intermittent nature of RESs brings several challenges to the smart microgrids, such as reliability, power quality, and balance between supply and demand. Thus, forecasting power generation from RESs, such as wind turbines and solar panels, is becoming essential for the efficient and perpetual operations of the power grid and it also helps in attaining optimal utilization of RESs. Energy demand forecasting is also an integral part of smart microgrids that helps in planning the power generation and energy trading with commercial grid. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models are promising solutions for predicting consumers' demands and energy generations from RESs. In this context, this manuscript provides a comprehensive survey of the existing DL-based approaches, which are developed for power forecasting of wind turbines and solar panels as well as electric power load forecasting. It also discusses the datasets used to train and test the different DL-based prediction models, enabling future researchers to identify appropriate datasets to use in their work. Even though there are a few related surveys regarding energy management in smart grid applications, they are focused on a specific production application such as either solar or wind. Moreover, none of the surveys review the forecasting schemes for production and load side simultaneously. Finally, previous surveys do not consider the datasets used for forecasting despite their significance in DL-based forecasting approaches. Hence, our survey work is intrinsically different due to its datacentered view, along with presenting DL-based applications for load and energy generation forecasting in both residential and commercial sectors. The comparison of different DL approaches discussed in this manuscript reveals that the efficiency of such forecasting methods is highly dependent on the amount of the historical data and thus a large number of data storage devices and high processing power devices are required to deal with big data. Finally, this study raises several open research problems and opportunities in the area of renewable energy forecasting for smart microgrids.

In recent years, hypergraph learning has attracted increasing attention due to its flexibility and capability in modeling complex data correlation. In this paper, we first systematically review existing literature regarding hypergraph generation, including distance-based, representation-based, attribute-based, and network-based approaches. Then, we introduce the existing learning methods on a hypergraph, including transductive hypergraph learning, inductive hypergraph learning, hypergraph structure updating, and multi-modal hypergraph learning. After that, we present a tensor-based dynamic hypergraph representation and learning framework that can effectively describe high-order correlation in a hypergraph. To study the effectiveness and efficiency of hypergraph generation and learning methods, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on several typical applications, including object and action recognition, Microblog sentiment prediction, and clustering. In addition, we contribute a hypergraph learning development toolkit called THU-HyperG.

To achieve a cleaner production chain of battery electrode involving strongly-coupled intermediate parameters and control parameters, a reliable approach to quantify the feature importance and select the key feature variables for predicting battery intermediate products is urgently required. In this paper, a Gaussian process regression-based machine learning framework, which incorporates powerful automatic relevance determination kernels, is proposed for directly quantifying the importance of four intermediate production feature variables and analysing their influences on the prediction of battery electrode mass load. Specifically, these features include three intermediate parameters from the mixing step and a control parameter from the coating step. After deriving four different automatic relevance determination kernels, the importance of these four feature variables based on a regression modelling is comprehensively analysed. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed automatic relevance determination kernel-based Gaussian process regression models could not only quantify the importance weights for reliable feature selections but also help to achieve satisfactory electrode mass load prediction. Due to the data-driven nature, the proposed framework can be conveniently extended to improve the analysis and control of battery electrode production, further benefitting the manufactured battery yield, efficiencies and performance to achieve cleaner battery production.

Coupling machine learning and crop modeling improves crop yield prediction in the US Corn Belt	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CERES-WHEAT MODEL; INTEGRATING SATELLITE; GENOMIC SELECTION; CLIMATE EXTREMES; UNITED-STATES; APSIM; SIMULATION; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; TIME	This study investigates whether coupling crop modeling and machine learning (ML) improves corn yield predictions in the US Corn Belt. The main objectives are to explore whether a hybrid approach (crop modeling+ML) would result in better predictions, investigate which combinations of hybrid models provide the most accurate predictions, and determine the features from the crop modeling that are most effective to be integrated with ML for corn yield prediction. Five ML models (linear regression, LASSO, LightGBM, random forest, and XGBoost) and six ensemble models have been designed to address the research question. The results suggest that adding simulation crop model variables (APSIM) as input features to ML models can decrease yield prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) from 7 to 20%. Furthermore, we investigated partial inclusion of APSIM features in the ML prediction models and we found soil moisture related APSIM variables are most influential on the ML predictions followed by crop-related and phenology-related variables. Finally, based on feature importance measure, it has been observed that simulated APSIM average drought stress and average water table depth during the growing season are the most important APSIM inputs to ML. This result indicates that weather information alone is not sufficient and ML models need more hydrological inputs to make improved yield predictions.

Although classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms have been applied successfully to ecological and geomorphological modelling, their applicability to SSL estimation in rivers has not yet been investigated. In this study, we evaluated use of a CART model to estimate SSL based on hydro-meteorological data. We also compared the accuracy of the CART model with that of the four most commonly used models for time series modelling of SSL, i.e. adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and two kernels of support vector machines (RBF-SVM and P-SVM). The models were calibrated using river discharge, stage, rainfall and monthly SSL data for the Kareh-Sang River gauging station in the Haraz watershed in northern Iran, where sediment transport is a considerable issue. In addition, different combinations of input data with various time lags were explored to estimate SSL. The best input combination was identified through trial and error, percent bias (PBIAS), Taylor diagrams and violin plots for each model. For evaluating the capability of the models, different statistics such as Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and percent bias (PBIAS) were used. The results showed that the CART model performed best in predicting SSL (NSE = 0.77, KGE = 0.8, PBIAS < +/- 15), followed by RBF-SVM(NSE = 0.68, KGE = 0.72, PBIAS < +/- 15). Thus the CART model can be a helpful tool in basins where hydro-meteorological data are readily available. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For medical professionals, it is important to keep track of these developments to ensure that deep learning can have meaningful impact on clinical practice. This review aims to be a stepping stone in this process. The general concepts underlying most successful deep learning algorithms are explained, and an overview of the state-of-the-art deep learning in cardiovascular imaging is provided. This review discusses >80 papers, covering modalities ranging from cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and single-photon emission computed tomography, to intravascular optical coherence tomography and echocardiography. Many different machines learning algorithms were used throughout these papers, with the most common being convolutional neural networks. Recent algorithms such as generative adversarial models were also used. The potential implications of deep learning algorithms on clinical practice, now and in the near future, are discussed.

We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method-dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method-sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path-dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.

J	Xiao, YW; Wu, J; Lin, ZL; Zhao, XD				Xiao, Yawen; Wu, Jun; Lin, Zongli; Zhao, Xiaodong			A deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method for cancer prediction	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Multi-model ensemble; Deep learning; Gene expression; Feature selection; Cancer prediction		Background and Objective: Cancer is a complex worldwide health problem associated with high mortality. With the rapid development of the high-throughput sequencing technology and the application of various machine learning methods that have emerged in recent years, progress in cancer prediction has been increasingly made based on gene expression, providing insight into effective and accurate treatment decision making. Thus, developing machine learning methods, which can successfully distinguish cancer patients from healthy persons, is of great current interest. However, among the classification methods applied to cancer prediction so far, no one method outperforms all the others. Methods: In this paper, we demonstrate a new strategy, which applies deep learning to an ensemble approach that incorporates multiple different machine learning models. We supply informative gene data selected by differential gene expression analysis to five different classification models. Then, a deep learning method is employed to ensemble the outputs of the five classifiers. Results: The proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method was tested on three public RNA-seq data sets of three kinds of cancers, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma and Breast Invasive Carcinoma. The test results indicate that it increases the prediction accuracy of cancer for all the tested RNA-seq data sets as compared to using a single classifier or the majority voting algorithm. Conclusions: By taking full advantage of different classifiers, the proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method is shown to be accurate and effective for cancer prediction.

To train the two stand-alone models and their ensembles, for the first stage, the areas affected in the past by torrential phenomena are identified using remote sensing techniques. Approximately 70% of these areas are used as a training data set along with 10 flash-flood predictors. It should be remarked that the remote sensing techniques play a crucial role in obtaining eight out of 10 flash-flood conditioning factors. The predictive capability of predictors is evaluated through the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. As expected, the slope angle results in the factor with the highest predictive capability. The application of the AHP model implies the construction of ten pair-wise comparison matrices for calculating the normalized weights of each flash-flood predictor. The computed weights are used as input data in kNN-AHP and KS-AHP ensemble models for calculating the Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI). The FFPI also is determined through kNN and KS stand-alone models. The performance of the models is evaluated using statistical metrics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) while the validation of the results is done by constructing the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) values and by calculating the density of torrential pixels within FFPI classes. Overall, the best performance is obtained by the kNN-AHP ensemble model.

New phosphors are traditionally identified through chemical intuition or trial and error synthesis, inhibiting the discovery of potential high-performance materials. Here, we merge a support vector machine regression model to predict a phosphor host crystal structure's Debye temperature, which is a proxy for photoluminescent quantum yield, with high-throughput density functional theory calculations to evaluate the band gap. This platform allows the identification of phosphors that may have otherwise been overlooked. Among the compounds with the highest Debye temperature and largest band gap, NaBaB9O15 shows outstanding potential. Following its synthesis and structural characterization, the structural rigidity is confirmed to stem from a unique corner sharing [B3O7](5-) polyanionic backbone. Substituting this material with Eu2+ yields UV excitation bands and a narrow violet emission at 416 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of 34.5 nm. More importantly, NaBaB9O15: Eu2+ possesses a quantum yield of 95% and excellent thermal stability.

J	Lu, HF; Ma, X				Lu, Hongfang; Ma, Xin			Hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models for short-term water quality prediction	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Decision tree-based model; Short-term; Water quality prediction; Extreme gradient boosting; Random forest; Data denoising	NEURAL-NETWORK; LAKE	Water resources are the foundation of people's life and economic development, and are closely related to health and the environment. Accurate prediction of water quality is the key to improving water management and pollution control. In this paper, two novel hybrid decision tree-based machine learning models are proposed to obtain more accurate short-term water quality prediction results. The basic models of the two hybrid models are extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), which respectively introduce an advanced data denoising technique - complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Taking the water resources of Gales Creek site in Tualatin River (one of the most polluted rivers in the world) Basin as an example, a total of 1875 data (hourly data) from May 1, 2019 to July 20, 2019 are collected. Two hybrid models are used to predict six water quality indicators, including water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH value, specific conductance, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter. Six error metrics are introduced as the basis of performance evaluation, and the results of the two models are compared with the other four conventional models. The results reveal that: (1) CEEMDAN-RF performs best in the prediction of temperature, dissolved oxygen and specific conductance, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 0.69%, 1.05%, and 0.90%, respectively. CEEMDAN-XGBoost performs best in the prediction of pH value, turbidity, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter, the MAPEs are 0.27%, 14.94%, and 1.59%, respectively. (2) The average MAPEs of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMMDAN-XGBoost models are the smallest, which are 3.90% and 3.71% respectively, indicating that their overall prediction performance is the best. In addition, the stability of the prediction model is also discussed in this paper. The analysis shows that the prediction stability of CEEMDAN-RF and CEEMDAN-XGBoost is higher than other benchmark models. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there is limited research on the possible relationships between running gait patterns and weekly running mileages. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been used for pattern recognition and classification of gait features to emphasize the uniqueness of gait patterns. However, they all have a representative problem of being a black box that often lacks the interpretability of the predicted results of the classifier. Therefore, this study was conducted using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) technology to investigate the differences in running gait patterns between higher-mileage runners and low-mileage runners. It was found that the ankle and knee provide considerable information to recognize gait features, especially in the sagittal and transverse planes. This may be the reason why high-mileage and low-mileage runners have different injury patterns due to their different gait patterns. The early stages of stance are very important in gait pattern recognition because the pattern contains effective information related to gait. The findings of the study noted that LRP completes a feasible interpretation of the predicted results of the model, thus providing more interesting insights and more effective information for analyzing gait patterns.

This helps enhance their awareness of the imminent hazards. However, conventional behavior prediction solutions are applicable in simple driving scenarios that require short prediction horizons. Most recently, deep learning-based approaches have become popular due to their promising performance in more complex environments compared to the conventional approaches. Motivated by this increased popularity, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of deep learning-based approaches for vehicle behavior prediction in this article. We firstly give an overview of the generic problem of vehicle behavior prediction and discuss its challenges, followed by classification and review of the most recent deep learning-based solutions based on three criteria: input representation, output type, and prediction method. The article also discusses the performance of several well-known solutions, identifies the research gaps in the literature and outlines potential new research directions.

From the perspective of image analysis, it is essential to develop advanced automatic US image analysis methods to assist in US diagnosis and/or to make such assessment more objective and accurate. Deep learning has recently emerged as the leading machine learning tool in various research fields, and especially in general imaging analysis and computer vision. Deep learning also shows huge potential for various automatic US image analysis tasks. This review first briefly introduces several popular deep learning architectures, and then summarizes and thoroughly discusses their applications in various specific tasks in US image analysis, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. Finally, the open challenges and potential trends of the future application of deep learning in medical US image analysis are discussed. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

Some popular classification algorithms such as artificial neural networks and support vector machine have been extensively studied and tested with many application cases, while the random forest, one of the present state-of-the-art classifiers based on ensemble learning strategy, is relatively unknown in this field. In this paper, the behavior of random forest for the intelligent diagnosis of rotating machinery is investigated with various features on two datasets. A framework for the comparison of different methods, that is, random forest, extreme learning machine, probabilistic neural network and support vector machine, is presented to find the most efficient one. Random forest has been proven to outperform the comparative classifiers in terms of recognition accuracy, stability and robustness to features, especially with a small training set. Additionally, compared with traditional methods, random forest is not easily influenced by environmental noise. Furthermore, the user-friendly parameters in random forest offer great convenience for practical engineering. These results suggest that random forest is a promising pattern recognition method for the intelligent diagnosis of rotating machinery.

J	Desai, RJ; Wang, SV; Vaduganathan, M; Evers, T; Schneeweiss, S				Desai, Rishi J.; Wang, Shirley V.; Vaduganathan, Muthiah; Evers, Thomas; Schneeweiss, Sebastian			Comparison of Machine Learning Methods With Traditional Models for Use of Administrative Claims With Electronic Medical Records to Predict Heart Failure Outcomes	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							DISEASE; UPDATE	Key PointsQuestionCan prediction of patient outcomes in heart failure based on routinely collected claims data be improved with machine learning methods and incorporating linked electronic medical records? FindingsIn this prognostic study including records on 9502 patients, machine learning methods offered only limited improvement over logistic regression in predicting key outcomes in heart failure based on administrative claims. Inclusion of additional predictors from electronic medical records improved prediction for mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and loss in home days but not for high cost. MeaningModels based on claims-only predictors may achieve modest discrimination and accuracy in prediction of key patient outcomes in heart failure, and machine learning approaches and incorporation of additional predictors from electronic medical records may offer some improvement in risk prediction of select outcomes. ImportanceAccurate risk stratification of patients with heart failure (HF) is critical to deploy targeted interventions aimed at improving patients' quality of life and outcomes. ObjectivesTo compare machine learning approaches with traditional logistic regression in predicting key outcomes in patients with HF and evaluate the added value of augmenting claims-based predictive models with electronic medical record (EMR)-derived information. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA prognostic study with a 1-year follow-up period was conducted including 9502 Medicare-enrolled patients with HF from 2 health care provider networks in Boston, Massachusetts ("providers" includes physicians, clinicians, other health care professionals, and their institutions that comprise the networks). The study was performed from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2014; data were analyzed from January 1 to December 31, 2018. Main Outcomes and MeasuresAll-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, top cost decile, and home days loss greater than 25% were modeled using logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operation regression, classification and regression trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted modeling (GBM). All models were trained using data from network 1 and tested in network 2. After selecting the most efficient modeling approach based on discrimination, Brier score, and calibration, area under precision-recall curves (AUPRCs) and net benefit estimates from decision curves were calculated to focus on the differences when using claims-only vs claims+EMR predictors. ResultsA total of 9502 patients with HF with a mean (SD) age of 78 (8) years were included: 6113 from network 1 (training set) and 3389 from network 2 (testing set). Gradient-boosted modeling consistently provided the highest discrimination, lowest Brier scores, and good calibration across all 4 outcomes; however, logistic regression had generally similar performance (C statistics for logistic regression based on claims-only predictors: mortality, 0.724; 95% CI, 0.705-0.744; HF hospitalization, 0.707; 95% CI, 0.676-0.737; high cost, 0.734; 95% CI, 0.703-0.764; and home days loss claims only, 0.781; 95% CI, 0.764-0.798; C statistics for GBM: mortality, 0.727; 95% CI, 0.708-0.747; HF hospitalization, 0.745; 95% CI, 0.718-0.772; high cost, 0.733; 95% CI, 0.703-0.763; and home days loss, 0.790; 95% CI, 0.773-0.807). Higher AUPRCs were obtained for claims+EMR vs claims-only GBMs predicting mortality (0.484 vs 0.423), HF hospitalization (0.413 vs 0.403), and home time loss (0.575 vs 0.521) but not cost (0.249 vs 0.252). The net benefit for claims+EMR vs claims-only GBMs was higher at various threshold probabilities for mortality and home time loss outcomes but similar for the other 2 outcomes. Conclusions and RelevanceMachine learning methods offered only limited improvement over traditional logistic regression in predicting key HF outcomes. Inclusion of additional predictors from EMRs to claims-based models appeared to improve prediction for some, but not all, outcomes. This prognostic study compares several machine learning approaches with traditional logistic regression for development of predictive models for all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, high cost, and loss in home time, among patients with heart failure.

In this paper, a novel method called EnsemLSTM is proposed by using nonlinear-learning ensemble of deep learning time series prediction based on LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory neural networks), SVRM (support vector regression machine) and EO (extremal optimization algorithm). First, in order to avert the drawback of weak generalization capability and robustness of a single deep learning approach when facing diversiform data, a cluster of LSTMs with diverse hidden layers and neurons are employed to explore and exploit the implicit information of wind speed time series. Then predictions of LSTMs are aggregated into a nonlinear-learning regression top-layer composed of SVRM and the EO is introduced to optimize the parameters of the top-layer. Lastly, the final ensemble prediction for wind speed is given by the fine-turning top-layer. The proposed EnsemLSTM is applied on two case studies data collected from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China, to perform ten-minute ahead utmost short term wind speed forecasting and one-hour ahead short term wind speed forecasting. Statistical tests of experimental results compared with other popular prediction models demonstrated the proposed EnsemLSTM can achieve a better forecasting performance.

The ADR should reflect the adenoma prevalence rate, which is estimated to be higher than 50% in the screening-age population. However, the ADR by colonoscopists varies from 7% to 53%. It is estimated that every 1% increase in ADR lowers the risk of interval colorectal cancers by 3%-6%. New strategies are needed to increase the ADR during colonoscopy. We tested the ability of computer-assisted image analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs; a deep learning model for image analysis) to improve polyp detection, a surrogate of ADR. METHODS: We designed and trained deep CNNs to detect polyps using a diverse and representative set of 8,641 hand-labeled images from screening colonoscopies collected from more than 2000 patients. We tested the models on 20 colonoscopy videos with a total duration of 5 hours. Expert colonoscopists were asked to identify all polyps in 9 de-identified colonoscopy videos, which were selected from archived video studies, with or without benefit of the CNN overlay. Their findings were compared with those of the CNN using CNN-assisted expert review as the reference. RESULTS: When tested on manually labeled images, the CNN identified polyps with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.991 and an accuracy of 96.4%. In the analysis of colonoscopy videos in which 28 polyps were removed, 4 expert reviewers identified 8 additional polyps without CNN assistance that had not been removed and identified an additional 17 polyps with CNN assistance (45 in total). All polyps removed and identified by expert review were detected by the CNN. The CNN had a false-positive rate of 7%. CONCLUSION: In a set of 8,641 colonoscopy images containing 4,088 unique polyps, the CNN identified polyps with a cross-validation accuracy of 96.4% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.991. The CNN system detected and localized polyps well within real-time constraints using an ordinary desktop machine with a contemporary graphics processing unit. This system could increase the ADR and decrease interval colorectal cancers but requires validation in large multicenter trials.

The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filter (CNN-SVM + Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.02%, 100% and 95.23%, respectively in automated detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases and obtained the highest performance. Hence, our developed model is ready for clinical application.

An Open IoHT-Based Deep Learning Framework for Online Medical Image Recognition	IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						IoT; imaging Processing; deep learning; machine learning; computational intelligence		Systems developed to work with computational intelligence have become very efficient, and in some cases obtain more accurate results than evaluations by humans. Hence, this work proposes a new online approach based on deep learning tools according to the concept of transfer learning to generate a computational intelligence framework for use with the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) devices. This framework allows the user to add their images and perform platform training almost as easily as creating folders and placing files in regular cloud storage services. The trials carried out with the tool showed that even people with no programming and image processing knowledge were able to set up projects in a few minutes. The proposed approach is validated using three medical databases, which include cerebral vascular accident images for stroke type classification, lung nodule images for malignant classification, and skin images for the classification of melanocytic lesions. The results show the efficiency and reliability of the framework, which reached 91.6% Accuracy in the stroke images and lung nodules databases, and 92% Accuracy in the skin images databases. This prove the immense contribution that this work can bring to assist medical professionals in analyzing complex examinations quickly and accurately, allowing a large medical examination database through a consolidated collaborative IoT platform.

Recently, deep learning methods applied to machine health monitoring have been proven effective. However, the existing methods face enormous difficulties in extracting heterogeneous features indicating the variation until failure and revealing the inherent high-dimensional features of massive signals, which affect the accuracy and efficiency of machine health monitoring. In this paper, a novel data-driven machine health monitoring method is proposed using adaptive kernel spectral clustering (AKSC) and deep long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN). This method include three steps: First, features in the time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain are, respectively, extracted from massive measured signals. And, an Euclidean distance based algorithm is designed to select degradation features. Second, the AKSC algorithm is introduced to adaptively identify machine anomaly behaviors from multiple degradation features. Third, a new deep learning model (LSTM-RNN) is constructed to update and predict the failure time of the machine. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a set of test-to-failure experimental data. The results show that the performance of the proposed method is competitive with other existing methods.

Machine learning algorithms are used to uncover patterns among the attributes of this data. Hence, they can be used to make predictions that can be used by medical practitioners and people at managerial level to make executive decisions. Not all the attributes in the datasets generated are important for training the machine learning algorithms. Some attributes might be irrelevant and some might not affect the outcome of the prediction. Ignoring or removing these irrelevant or less important attributes reduces the burden on machine learning algorithms. In this work two of the prominent dimensionality reduction techniques, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are investigated on four popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier using publicly available Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset from University of California and Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimentation results prove that PCA outperforms LDA in all the measures. Also, the performance of the classifiers, Decision Tree, Random Forest examined is not affected much by using PCA and LDA.To further analyze the performance of PCA and LDA the eperimentation is carried out on Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) datasets. Experimentation results prove that ML algorithms with PCA produce better results when dimensionality of the datasets is high. When dimensionality of datasets is low it is observed that the ML algorithms without dimensionality reduction yields better results.	[Reddy, G. Thippa; Reddy, M.

However, IoT has been proven to be vulnerable to security breaches. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fool proof solutions by creating new technologies or combining existing technologies to address the security issues. Deep learning, a branch of machine learning has shown promising results in previous studies for detection of security breaches. Additionally, IoT devices generate large volumes, variety, and veracity of data. Thus, when big data technologies are incorporated, higher performance and better data handling can be achieved. Hence, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art deep learning, IoT security, and big data technologies. Further, a comparative analysis and the relationship among deep learning, IoT security, and big data technologies have also been discussed. Further, we have derived a thematic taxonomy from the comparative analysis of technical studies of the three aforementioned domains. Finally, we have identified and discussed the challenges in incorporating deep learning for IoT security using big data technologies and have provided directions to future researchers on the IoT security aspects.

The advances in remote sensing technologies, hence the fast-growing volume of timely data available at the global scale, offer new opportunities for a variety of applications. Deep learning being significantly successful in dealing with Big Data, seems to be a great candidate for exploiting the potentials of such complex massive data. However, there are some challenges related to the ground-truth, resolution, and the nature of data that strongly impact the performance of classification. In this paper, we review the use of deep learning in land use and land cover classification based on multispectral and hyperspectral images and we introduce the available data sources and datasets used by literature studies; we provide the readers with a framework to interpret the-state-of-the-art of deep learning in this context and offer a platform to approach methodologies, data, and challenges of the field.

In this study, an anisotropic soil model developed by Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI) based on the Active-Direct shear-Passive concept (NGI-ADP model) was adopted to conduct finite element (FE) analyses. A total of 682 cases were modeled to analyze the effects of five key parameters on twin-tunnel structural forces; these parameters included twin-tunnel arrangements and subsurface soil properties: burial depth H, tunnel center-to-center distance D, soil strength sAu , stiffness ratio Gu/sAu , and degree of anisotropy su/sAu . The significant factors contributing to the bending moment and thrust force of the linings were the tunnel distance and overlying soil depth, respectively. The degree of anisotropy of the surrounding soil was found to be extremely important in simulating the twin-tunnel construction, and severe design errors could be made if the soil anisotropy is ignored. A cutting-edge application of machine learning in the construction of twin tunnels is presented; multivariate adaptive regression splines and decision tree regressor methods are developed to predict the maximum bending moment within the first tunnel's linings based on the constructed FE cases. The developed prediction model can enable engineers to estimate the structural response of twin tunnels more accurately in order to meet the specific target reliability indices of projects.

However, owing to climate changes and human activities, natural runoff often contains a variety of frequency components, and existing monthly runoff estimation techniques may fail to capture potential change processes effectively. To overcome this problem, we have developed a hybrid model for monthly runoff prediction. First, observed runoff is decomposed into several subcomponents via variational mode decomposition. Second, support vector machine models based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization are adopted to identify the input-output relationships hidden in each subcomponent. Finally, the total output of all submodules is treated as the final forecasting result for the original runoff. Three quantitative indexes are considered to test the performance of the developed models. The monthly streamflow of two reservoirs in China's Yangtze Valley is considered as the survey target. This area contains the world's largest hydropower project (Three Gorges Reservoir) and the waterhead of the middle line of Asia's largest inter-basin water transfer project (Danjiangkou Reservoir). Test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods (artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines), making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs.

SchNet - A deep learning architecture for molecules and materials	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article								Deep learning has led to a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, including web, text, and image search, speech recognition, as well as bioinformatics, with growing impact in chemical physics. Machine learning, in general, and deep learning, in particular, are ideally suitable for representing quantum-mechanical interactions, enabling us to model nonlinear potential-energy surfaces or enhancing the exploration of chemical compound space. Here we present the deep learning architecture SchNet that is specifically designed to model atomistic systems by making use of continuous-filter convolutional layers. We demonstrate the capabilities of SchNet by accurately predicting a range of properties across chemical space for molecules and materials, where our model learns chemically plausible embeddings of atom types across the periodic table. Finally, we employ SchNet to predict potential-energy surfaces and energy-conserving force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of small molecules and perform an exemplary study on the quantum-mechanical properties of C-20-fullerene that would have been infeasible with regular ab initio molecular dynamics.

Recently, it has also been introduced in food science and engineering. To our knowledge, this review is the first in the food domain. In this paper, we provided a brief introduction of deep learning and detailedly described the structure of some popular architectures of deep neural networks and the approaches for training a model. We surveyed dozens of articles that used deep learning as the data analysis tool to solve the problems and challenges in food domain, including food recognition, calories estimation, quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat and aquatic products, food supply chain, and food contamination. The specific problems, the datasets, the preprocessing methods, the networks and frameworks used, the performance achieved, and the comparison with other popular solutions of each research were investigated. We also analyzed the potential of deep learning to be used as an advanced data mining tool in food sensory and consume researches. The result of our survey indicates that deep learning outperforms other methods such as manual feature extractors, conventional machine learning algorithms, and deep learning as a promising tool in food quality and safety inspection. The encouraging results in classification and regression problems achieved by deep learning will attract more research efforts to apply deep learning into the field of food in the future.

Evolved from the previous research on artificial neural networks, this technology has shown superior performance to other machine learning algorithms in areas such as image and voice recognition, natural language processing, among others. The first wave of applications of deep learning in pharmaceutical research has emerged in recent years, and its utility has gone beyond bioactivity predictions and has shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery.

Viscosity and density analysis were investigated by varying temperatures (25 to 50 & DEG;C), and wt% (0.01 to 0.25). For 0.25 wt% at 50 & DEG;C, density increased by 2.45%, and viscosity by 133.5%. The development of a prediction model by processing the variational parameters with machine learning and studying properties such as characterization, stability, and density of rGO-Fe3O4-TiO2 hybrid nanofluids has provided an unprecedented study in the literature. The nonlinear nature and volume of data generated by the subsequent experimental study were difficult to model using traditional analytical methods. As a result, for the creation of prognostic models, advanced machine learning techniques such as Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) was applied. These prediction models' prognostic skills and uncertainty were assessed using statistical indices, Theil's statistics, and Taylor's diagram. The R-value for the BRT-based density (0.9989) and viscosity (0.9979) prediction models was higher than that of the ANN-based and SVM-based prediction models. In developed density models, Theil's U2 uncertainty was as low as 0.0689, 0.0775, and 0.0981 for BRT, ANN, and SVM, respectively. As a conclusion, it is stated that BRT, ANN, and SVM can accurately imitate the laboratory-based assessment of density and viscosity values of ternary hybrid nanofluids over a wide temperature and nanoparticle concentration ratio range. On the other hand, the BRT was marginally better than ANN but much better than SVM. The current study's findings are appropriate for applications needing long-term stability and improved heat transfer performance. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modeling Pan Evaporation Using Gaussian Process Regression K-Nearest Neighbors Random Forest and Support Vector Machines; Comparative Analysis	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						machine learning; meteorological parameters; pan evaporation; advanced statistical analysis; hydrological cycle; big data; hydroinformatics; random forest (RF); support vector regression (SVR)	GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; CROP EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; PREDICTION; REQUIREMENTS; REGIONS	Evaporation is a very important process; it is one of the most critical factors in agricultural, hydrological, and meteorological studies. Due to the interactions of multiple climatic factors, evaporation is considered as a complex and nonlinear phenomenon to model. Thus, machine learning methods have gained popularity in this realm. In the present study, four machine learning methods of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict the pan evaporation (PE). Meteorological data including PE, temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (W), and sunny hours (S) collected from 2011 through 2017. The accuracy of the studied methods was determined using the statistical indices of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, the Taylor charts utilized for evaluating the accuracy of the mentioned models. The results of this study showed that at Gonbad-e Kavus, Gorgan and Bandar Torkman stations, GPR with RMSE of 1.521 mm/day, 1.244 mm/day, and 1.254 mm/day, KNN with RMSE of 1.991 mm/day, 1.775 mm/day, and 1.577 mm/day, RF with RMSE of 1.614 mm/day, 1.337 mm/day, and 1.316 mm/day, and SVR with RMSE of 1.55 mm/day, 1.262 mm/day, and 1.275 mm/day had more appropriate performances in estimating PE values. It was found that GPR for Gonbad-e Kavus Station with input parameters of T, W and S and GPR for Gorgan and Bandar Torkmen stations with input parameters of T, RH, W and S had the most accurate predictions and were proposed for precise estimation of PE. The findings of the current study indicated that the PE values may be accurately estimated with few easily measured meteorological parameters.

Hadi			A Survey on Federated Learning for Resource-Constrained IoT Devices	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Edge computing; Computational modeling; Internet of Things; Data models; Servers; Collaborative work; Training; Convergence; federated learning (FL); global model; local model; on-device training; resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices	PRIVACY; INTERNET; COMMUNICATION; OPTIMIZATION	Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning strategy that generates a global model by learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. FL enables on-device training, keeping the client's local data private, and further, updating the global model based on the local model updates. While FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they assume there are available computational resources at each edge-device/client. However, the Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices, e.g., robots, drone swarms, and low-cost computing devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi), may have limited processing ability, low bandwidth and power, or limited storage capacity. In this survey article, we propose to answer this question: how to train distributed machine learning models for resource-constrained IoT devices? To this end, we first explore the existing studies on FL, relative assumptions for distributed implementation using IoT devices, and explore their drawbacks. We then discuss the implementation challenges and issues when applying FL to an IoT environment. We highlight an overview of FL and provide a comprehensive survey of the problem statements and emerging challenges, particularly during applying FL within heterogeneous IoT environments.

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in the image detection and recognition applications. However, they require intensive CPU operations and memory bandwidth that make general CPUs fail to achieve the desired performance levels. Consequently, hardware accelerators that use application-specific integrated circuits, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and graphic processing units have been employed to improve the throughput of CNNs. More precisely, FPGAs have been recently adopted for accelerating the implementation of deep learning networks due to their ability to maximize parallelism and their energy efficiency. In this paper, we review the recent existing techniques for accelerating deep learning networks on FPGAs. We highlight the key features employed by the various techniques for improving the acceleration performance. In addition, we provide recommendations for enhancing the utilization of FPGAs for CNNs acceleration. The techniques investigated in this paper represent the recent trends in the FPGA-based accelerators of deep learning networks. Thus, this paper is expected to direct the future advances on efficient hardware accelerators and to be useful for deep learning researchers.

J	Hussain, A; Cambria, E				Hussain, Amir; Cambria, Erik			Semi-supervised learning for big social data analysis	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; Big social data analysis; Sentiment analysis		In an era of social media and connectivity, web users are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about interacting, sharing, and working together through online collaborative media. More recently, this collective intelligence has spread to many different areas, with a growing impact on everyday life, such as in education, health, commerce and tourism, leading to an exponential growth in the size of the social Web. However, the distillation of knowledge from such unstructured Big data is, an extremely challenging task. Consequently, the semantic and multimodal contents of the Web in this present day are, whilst being well suited for human use, still barely accessible to machines. In this work, we explore the potential of a novel semi-supervised learning model based on the combined use of random projection scaling as part of a vector space model, and support vector machines to perform reasoning on a knowledge base. The latter is developed by merging a graph representation of commonsense with a linguistic resource for the lexical representation of affect. Comparative simulation results show a significant improvement in tasks such as emotion recognition and polarity detection, and pave the way for development of future semi-supervised learning approaches to big social data analytics.

Efficient C center dot G-to-G center dot C base editors developed using CRISPRi screens, target-library analysis, and machine learning	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DNA GLYCOSYLASE UDGX; GENOMIC DNA; TRANSCRIPTION; BINDING	Programmable C center dot G-to-G center dot C base editors (CGBEs) have broad scientific and therapeutic potential, but their editing outcomes have proved difficult to predict and their editing efficiency and product purity are often low. We describe a suite of engineered CGBEs paired with machine learning models to enable efficient, high-purity C center dot G-to-G center dot C base editing. We performed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen targeting DNA repair genes to identify factors that affect C center dot G-to-G center dot C editing outcomes and used these insights to develop CGBEs with diverse editing profiles. We characterized ten promising CGBEs on a library of 10,638 genomically integrated target sites in mammalian cells and trained machine learning models that accurately predict the purity and yield of editing outcomes (R = 0.90) using these data. These CGBEs enable correction to the wild-type coding sequence of 546 disease-related transversion single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with >90% precision (mean 96%) and up to 70% efficiency (mean 14%). Computational prediction of optimal CGBE-single-guide RNA pairs enables high-purity transversion base editing at over fourfold more target sites than achieved using any single CGBE variant. Efficiency of transversion base editing is increased by matching a set of base editors to target sequences.

Advanced machine learning in action: identification of intracranial hemorrhage on computed tomography scans of the head with clinical workflow integration	NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE			English	Article							INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE; AIDED DIAGNOSIS; CT; MANAGEMENT	Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) requires prompt diagnosis to optimize patient outcomes. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms could automatically analyze computed tomography (CT) of the head, prioritize radiology worklists and reduce time to diagnosis of ICH. 46,583 head CTs (similar to 2 million images) acquired from 2007-2017 were collected from several facilities across Geisinger. A deep convolutional neural network was trained on 37,074 studies and subsequently evaluated on 9499 unseen studies. The predictive model was implemented prospectively for 3 months to re-prioritize "routine" head CT studies as "stat" on realtime radiology worklists if an ICH was detected. Time to diagnosis was compared between the re-prioritized "stat" and "routine" studies. A neuroradiologist blinded to the study reviewed false positive studies to determine whether the dictating radiologist overlooked ICH. The model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.846 (0.837-0.856). During implementation, 94 of 347 "routine" studies were re-prioritized to "stat", and 60/94 had ICH identified by the radiologist. Five new cases of ICH were identified, and median time to diagnosis was significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) from 512 to 19 min. In particular, one outpatient with vague symptoms on anti-coagulation was found to have an ICH which was treated promptly with reversal of anticoagulation, resulting in a good clinical outcome. Of the 34 false positives, the blinded over-reader identified four probable ICH cases overlooked in original interpretation. In conclusion, an artificial intelligence algorithm can prioritize radiology worklists to reduce time to diagnosis of new outpatient ICH by 96% and may also identify subtle ICH overlooked by radiologists. This demonstrates the positive impact of advanced machine learning in radiology workflow optimization.

We first discuss general reasons for the popularity of deep learning, including several major breakthroughs in computer science. Next, we start reviewing the fundamental basics of the perceptron and neural networks, along with some fundamental theory that is often omitted. Doing so allows us to understand the reasons for the rise of deep learning in many application domains. Obviously medical image processing is one of these areas which has been largely affected by this rapid progress, in particular in image detection and recognition, image segmentation, image registration, and computer-aided diagnosis. There are also recent trends in physical simulation, modeling, and reconstruction that have led to astonishing results. Yet, some of these approaches neglect prior knowledge and hence bear the risk of producing implausible results. These apparent weaknesses highlight current limitations of deep ( )learning. However, we also briefly discuss promising approaches that might be able to resolve these problems in the future.

Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						transfer learning; natural language processing; multi-task learning; attention-based models; deep learning		Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.(1)	[Raffel, Colin; Shazeer, Noam; Roberts, Adam; Lee, Katherine; Narang, Sharan; Matena, Michael; Zhou, Yanqi; Li, Wei; Liu, Peter J.] Google, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA		Raffel, C (corresponding author), Google, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.

Delta-machine learning for potential energy surfaces: A PIP approach to bring a DFT-based PES to CCSD(T) level of theory	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article								"Delta -machine learning" refers to a machine learning approach to bring a property such as a potential energy surface (PES) based on low-level (LL) density functional theory (DFT) energies and gradients close to a coupled cluster (CC) level of accuracy. Here, we present such an approach that uses the permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) method to fit high-dimensional PESs. The approach is represented by a simple equation, in obvious notation V-LL -> CC = V-LL + Delta VCC-LL, and demonstrated for CH4, H3O+, and trans and cis-N-methyl acetamide (NMA), CH3CONHCH3. For these molecules, the LL PES, V-LL, is a PIP fit to DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G(d) energies and gradients and Delta VCC-LL is a precise PIP fit obtained using a low-order PIP basis set and based on a relatively small number of CCSD(T) energies. For CH4, these are new calculations adopting an aug-cc-pVDZ basis, for H3O+, previous CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVQZ energies are used, while for NMA, new CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations are performed. With as few as 200 CCSD(T) energies, the new PESs are in excellent agreement with benchmark CCSD(T) results for the small molecules, and for 12-atom NMA, training is done with 4696 CCSD(T) energies.

Based on the nature of the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning techniques, namely deep learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges and potential directions for future research. At the end of each section, we highlight the lessons learned based on our experiments and review of the recent literature.

Many Machine Learning (ML) models have been employed for the detection and classification of plant diseases but, after the advancements in a subset of ML, that is, Deep Learning (DL), this area of research appears to have great potential in terms of increased accuracy. Many developed/modified DL architectures are implemented along with several visualization techniques to detect and classify the symptoms of plant diseases. Moreover, several performance metrics are used for the evaluation of these architectures/techniques. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of DL models used to visualize various plant diseases. In addition, some research gaps are identified from which to obtain greater transparency for detecting diseases in plants, even before their symptoms appear clearly.

Predicting optimal deep brain stimulation parameters for Parkinson's disease using functional MRI and machine learning	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS STIMULATION; BLOOD-FLOW RESPONSES; BASAL GANGLIA; MOTOR; ACTIVATION; LEVODOPA; ORGANIZATION; CIRCUITS; PATTERNS; TREMOR	Commonly used for Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation (DBS) produces marked clinical benefits when optimized. However, assessing the large number of possible stimulation settings (i.e., programming) requires numerous clinic visits. Here, we examine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to predict optimal stimulation settings for individual patients. We analyze 3T fMRI data prospectively acquired as part of an observational trial in 67 PD patients using optimal and non-optimal stimulation settings. Clinically optimal stimulation produces a characteristic fMRI brain response pattern marked by preferential engagement of the motor circuit. Then, we build a machine learning model predicting optimal vs. non-optimal settings using the fMRI patterns of 39 PD patients with a priori clinically optimized DBS (88% accuracy). The model predicts optimal stimulation settings in unseen datasets: a priori clinically optimized and stimulation-naive PD patients. We propose that fMRI brain responses to DBS stimulation in PD patients could represent an objective biomarker of clinical response. Upon further validation with additional studies, these findings may open the door to functional imaging-assisted DBS programming. Deep brain stimulation programming for Parkinson's disease entails the assessment of a large number of possible simulation settings, requiring numerous clinic visits after surgery. Here, the authors show that patterns of functional MRI can predict the optimal stimulation settings.

Due to COVID-19 & x2019;s spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications.

The present study proposes two machine learning algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a novel simple tree-based ensemble method named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), for accurate prediction of daily H using limited meteorological data. Daily H, maximum and minimum air temperatures (T-max and T-min), transformed precipitation (P-t, 1 for rainfall > 0 and 0 for rainfall = 0) and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (H-0) during 1966-2000 and 2001-2015 from three radiation stations in humid subtropical China were used to train and test the models, respectively. Two combinations of input parameters, i.e. (i) only T-max, T-min and R-a, and (ii) complete data were considered for simulations. The proposed machine learning models were also compared with four well-known empirical models to evaluate their performances. The results suggest that the SVM and XGBoost models outperformed the selected empirical models. The performance of the machine learning models was improved by 5.9-12.2% for training phase and by 8.0-11.5% for testing phase in terms of RMSE when information of precipitation was further included. Compared with the SVM model, the XGBoost model generally showed better performance for training phase, and slightly weaker but comparable performance for testing phase in terms of accuracy. However, the XGBoost model was more stable with average increase of 6.3% in RMSE, compared to 10.5% for the SVM algorithm. Also, the XGBoost model (3.02 s and 0.05 s for training and testing phase, respectively) showed much higher computation speed than the SVM model (27.48 s and 4.13 s for training and testing phase, respectively). By jointly considering the prediction accuracy, model stability and computational efficiency, the XGBoost model is highly recommended to estimate daily H using commonly available temperature and precipitation data with excellent performance in humid subtropical climates.

Many models may stagnate to low-accuracy results due to the uninformed choice of parameters. This paper presents a forward-thinking bankruptcy prediction model based on kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), which proposes a new efficient version of a fruit fly optimization (FOA) algorithm called LSEOFOA, to evolve and harmonize the penalty and the kernel parameter in KELM. The upgraded version of FOA is conceptualized based on three reorganizations. The first attempt is to include Levy's flight for improving exploration inclinations, and the second is based on slime mould algorithm (SMA) for avoiding premature convergence and enhancing the stability of the exploration and exploitation patterns. As the last modification, we utilized the elite opposition-based learning for accelerating the convergence. The algorithmic trends of this optimizer are verified, and then, it is verified on a bankruptcy prediction module. Therefore, to further demonstrate the superiority of the LSEOFOA method, comparison studies are performed using the conventional FOA and other variants of FOA and a set of advanced algorithms including EBOwithCMAR. Experimental results for every optimization task demonstrate that LSEOFOA can provide a high-performance and self-assured tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Also, the developed KELM classifier is utilized for bankruptcy prediction, and its optimal parameters set are revealed by the proposed FOA. The effectiveness of the LSEOFOA-KELM model is rigorously evaluated using a financial dataset and comparison with KELM-based models with other competitive optimizers such as LSHADE-RSP. Overall research findings show that the proposed model is superior in terms of classification accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity. Towards more evolutionary and efficient prediction models, the proposed LSEOFOA-KELM prediction model can be regarded as a promising warning tool for financial decision making, with successful performance in bankruptcy prediction.

J	Peng, WW; Ye, ZS; Chen, N				Peng, Weiwen; Ye, Zhi-Sheng; Chen, Nan			Bayesian Deep-Learning-Based Health Prognostics Toward Prognostics Uncertainty	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Uncertainty; Bayes methods; Deep learning; Data models; Neural networks; Training; Bayesian deep neural network; Bayesian reliability; deep learning; health prognostics; remaining useful life (RUL)	USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATION; NETWORKS	Deep-learning-based health prognostics is receiving ever-increasing attention. Most existing methods leverage advanced neural networks for prognostics performance improvement, providing mainly point estimates as prognostics results without addressing prognostics uncertainty. However, uncertainty is critical for both health prognostics and subsequent decision making, especially for safety-critical applications. Inspired by the idea of Bayesian machine learning, a Bayesian deep-learning-based (BDL-based) method is proposed in this paper for health prognostics with uncertainty quantification. State-of-the-art deep learning models are extended into Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and a variational-inference-based method is presented for the BNNs learning and inference. The proposed method is validated through a ball bearing dataset and a turbofan engine dataset. Other than point estimates, health prognostics using the BDL-based method is enhanced with uncertainty quantification. Scalability and generalization ability of state-of-the-art deep learning models can be well inherited. Stochastic regularization techniques, widely available in mainstream software libraries, can be leveraged to efficiently implement the BDL-based method for practical applications.

Not only are the oceans an important source of food and other resources, but they also play a important roles in the earth's climate and provide crucial ecosystem services. To monitor the environment and ensure sustainable exploitation of marine resources, extensive data collection and analysis efforts form the backbone of management programmes on global, regional, or national levels. Technological advances in sensor technology, autonomous platforms, and information and communications technology now allow marine scientists to collect data in larger volumes than ever before. But our capacity for data analysis has not progressed comparably, and the growing discrepancy is becoming a major bottleneck for effective use of the available data, as well as an obstacle to scaling up data collection further. Recent years have seen rapid advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and in particular, so-called deep learning systems are now able to solve complex tasks that previously required human expertise. This technology is directly applicable to many important data analysis problems and it will provide tools that are needed to solve many complex challenges in marine science and resource management. Here we give a brief review of recent developments in deep learning, and highlight the many opportunities and challenges for effective adoption of this technology across the marine sciences.

In this paper, a novel wind speed multi-step prediction model is designed based on the SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) and CNNSVM (Convolutional Support Vector Machine). In the SSA-EMD-CNNSVM model, the SSA is used to reduce the noise and extract the trend information of the original wind speed data; the EMD is used to extract the fluctuation features of the wind speed data and decompose the wind speed time series into a number of sub-layers; and the CNNSVM is used to predict each of the wind speed sub-layers. To investigate the prediction performance of the proposed model, some models are used as the comparison models, including the SVM model, CNNSVM model, EMD-BP model, EMD-RBF model and EMD-Elman model. According to the prediction results of the four experiments, it can be found that the proposed model can have significantly better performance than the seven comparison models from 1-step to 3-step wind speed predictions with the MAPE of 42.85% average performance promotion, MAE of 39.21% average performance promotion, RMSE of 39.25% average performance promotion.

To guarantee safe and reliable operation of a Li-ion battery pack, battery management systems (BMSs) should possess the capability to monitor, in real time, the state of health (SOH) of the individual cells in the pack. This paper presents a deep learning method which utilizes deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for cell-level capacity estimation based on the voltage, current, and charge capacity measurements during a partial charge cycle. The unique features of DCNN include the local connectivity and shared weights, which enable the model to accurately estimate battery capacity using the measurements during charge. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to apply deep learning to the online capacity estimation of Li-ion batteries. Ten-year daily cycling data from eight implantable Li-ion cells and half-year cycling data from 20 18650 Li-ion cells were utilized to verify the performance of the proposed deep learning method. Compared with traditional machine learning methods such as shallow neural networks and relevance vector machine (RVM), the proposed deep learning method is demonstrated to produce higher accuracy and robustness in the online estimation of Li-ion battery capacity.

Here we consider the capability of deep convolutional neural networks to perform the leaf counting task. Deep learning techniques typically require large and diverse datasets to learn generalizable models without providing a priori an engineered algorithm for performing the task. This requirement is challenging, however, for applications in the plant phenotyping field, where available datasets are often small and the costs associated with generating new data are high. In this work we propose a new method for augmenting plant phenotyping datasets using rendered images of synthetic plants. We demonstrate that the use of high-quality 3D synthetic plants to augment a dataset can improve performance on the leaf counting task. We also show that the ability of the model to generate an arbitrary distribution of phenotypes mitigates the problem of dataset shift when training and testing on different datasets. Finally, we show that real and synthetic plants are significantly interchangeable when training a neural network on the leaf counting task.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of deep CNN algorithms for detection and diagnosis of dental caries on periapical radiographs. Materials and methods: A total of 3000 periapical radiographic images were divided into a training and validation dataset (n = 2400 [80%]) and a test dataset (n = 600 [20%]). A pre-trained GoogLeNet Inception v3 CNN network was used for preprocessing and transfer learning. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for detection and diagnostic performance of the deep CNN algorithm. Results: The diagnostic accuracies of premolar, molar, and both premolar and molar models were 89.0% (80.4-93.3), 88.0% (79.2-93.1), and 82.0% (75.5-87.1), respectively. The deep CNN algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.917 (95% CI 0.860-0.975) on premolar, an AUC of 0.890 (95% CI 0.819-0.961) on molar, and an AUC of 0.845 (95% CI 0.790-0.901) on both premolar and molar models. The premolar model provided the best AUC, which was significantly greater than those for other models (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study highlighted the potential utility of deep CNN architecture for the detection and diagnosis of dental caries.

Thus it has triggered enormous research activities in machine learning and pattern recognition. One of the most important challenges of deep learning is to figure out relations between a feature and the depth of deep neural networks (deep nets for short) to reflect the necessity of depth. Our purpose is to quantify this feature-depth correspondence in feature extraction and generalization. We present the adaptivity of features to depths and vice-verse via showing a depth-parameter trade-off in extracting both single feature and composite features. Based on these results, we prove that implementing the classical empirical risk minimization on deep nets can achieve the optimal generalization performance for numerous learning tasks. Our theoretical results are verified by a series of numerical experiments including toy simulations and a real application of earthquake seismic intensity prediction.

The experiment was carried out in Yolo County, California, which has a very diverse irrigated agricultural system dominated by economic crops. For the challenging task of classifying summer crops using Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series, two types of deep learning models were designed: one is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the other is based on one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D) layers. Three widely-used classifiers were also tested for comparison, including a gradient boosting machine called XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Although LSTM is widely used for sequential data representation, in this study its accuracy (82.41%) and F1 score (0.67) were the lowest among all the classifiers. Among non-deep-learning classifiers, XGBoost achieved the best result with 84.17% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.69. The highest accuracy (85.54%) and F1 score (0.73) were achieved by the Conv1D-based model, which mainly consists of a stack of Conv1D layers and an inception module. The behavior of the Conv1D-based model was inspected by visualizing the activation on different layers. The model employs EVI time series by examining shapes at various scales in a hierarchical manner. Lower Conv1D layers of the optimized model capture small scale temporal variations, while upper layers focus on overall seasonal patterns. Conv1D layers were used as an embedded multi-level feature extractor in the classification model which automatically extracts features from input time series during training. The automated feature extraction reduces the dependency on manual feature engineering and pre-defined equations of crop growing cycles. This study shows that the Conv1D-based deep learning framework provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation in multi-temporal classification tasks.

In practical engineering, machines are mostly in healthy and faults seldom happen, it's difficult or expensive to collect massive labeled fault data. To solve the problem, an adaptive deep transfer learning method for bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a long-short term memory recurrent neural network model based on instance-transfer learning is constructed to generate some auxiliary datasets. Secondly, joint distribution adaptation, a feature-transfer learning method, which is used to reduce the differences in probability distributions between an auxiliary dataset and target domain dataset. Finally, grey wolf optimization algorithm is introduced to adaptively learn key parameters of joint distribution adaptation. The proposed method is verified with two kinds of datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method when the labeled fault data are scarce.

Amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology by mitophagy inducers identified via machine learning and a cross-species workflow	NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							INTERFERENCE COMPOUNDS PAINS; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; ASSAY INTERFERENCE; C. ELEGANS; A-BETA; LIFE-SPAN; KAEMPFEROL; NAD(+); MODEL; NEURONS	A reduced removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is common to aging and age-related neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strategies for treating such impaired mitophagy would benefit from the identification of mitophagy modulators. Here we report the combined use of unsupervised machine learning (involving vector representations of molecular structures, pharmacophore fingerprinting and conformer fingerprinting) and a cross-species approach for the screening and experimental validation of new mitophagy-inducing compounds. From a library of naturally occurring compounds, the workflow allowed us to identify 18 small molecules, and among them two potent mitophagy inducers (Kaempferol and Rhapontigenin). In nematode and rodent models of AD, we show that both mitophagy inducers increased the survival and functionality of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons, abrogated amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, and improved the animals' memory. Our findings suggest the existence of a conserved mechanism of memory loss across the AD models, this mechanism being mediated by defective mitophagy. The computational-experimental screening and validation workflow might help uncover potent mitophagy modulators that stimulate neuronal health and brain homeostasis.

The key features of these models are determined through a massive trial-and-error process. The proposed intelligent models estimate hydrogen solubility as a function of critical properties and acentric factor of aromatic/cyclic compounds, temperature, and pressure. The ranking analysis based on seven statistical criteria indicates the priority of the ANFIS method over other paradigms. The proposed ANFIS model estimates 278 experimental hydrogen solubility in eleven aromatic/cyclic compounds by the absolute average relative deviation of 7.88%, the mean absolute error of 0.0023, the relative absolute error of 5.05%, mean squared error of 2.74 x 10(-5), root mean squared error of 0.0052, and regression coefficient of 0.99664. Moreover, the relevancy analysis justifies that the pressure is the strongest influential variable for the hydrogen solubility in aromatic/cyclic compounds. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Position is one of the important circumstances in PBSs. For effective PBSs, extraction and recognition of meaningful positions and estimating the subsequent position are fundamental procedures. Several researchers and practitioners have tried to recognize and predict positions using various techniques; however, only few deliberate the progress of position-based real-time applications considering significant tasks of PBSs. In this paper, a method for conserving position confidentiality of roaming PBSs users using machine learning techniques is proposed. We recommend a three-phase procedure for roaming PBS users. It identifies user position by merging decision trees and k-nearest neighbor and estimates user destination along with the position track sequence using hidden Markov models. Moreover, a mobile edge computing service policy is followed in the proposed paradigm, which will ensure the timely delivery of PBSs. The benefits of mobile edge service policy offer position confidentiality and low latency by means of networking and computing services at the vicinity of roaming users. Thorough experiments are conducted, and it is confirmed that the proposed method achieved above 90% of the position confidentiality in PBSs.

However, many of existing DL methods fail in relationship mining between signals explicitly. Unlike those deep neural networks, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) taking graph data with topological structure as input is more efficient for data relationship mining, making GCN to be powerful for feature representation from graph data in non-Euclidean space. Nevertheless, existing GCNs have two limitations. First, most GCNs are constructed on unweighted graphs, considering importance of neighbors as the same, which is not in line with reality. Second, the receptive field of GCNs is fixed, which limits the effectiveness of GCNs for feature representation. To address these issues, a multireceptive field graph convolutional network (MRF-GCN) is proposed for effective intelligent fault diagnosis. In MRF-GCN, data samples are converted into weighted graphs to indicate differences in relationship of data samples. Moreover, MRF-GCN learns not only features from different receptive field, but also fuses learned features as an enhanced feature representation. To verify the efficacy of MRF-GCN for machine fault diagnosis, case studies are implemented, and the results show that MRF-GCN can achieve superior performance even under imbalanced dataset.

Successfully selecting informative features can significantly increase learning accuracy and improve result comprehensibility. Various methods have been proposed to identify informative features from high-dimensional data by removing redundant and irrelevant features to improve classification accuracy. In this article, we systematically survey existing sparse learning models for feature selection from the perspectives of individual sparse feature selection and group sparse feature selection, and analyze the differences and connections among various sparse learning models. Promising research directions and topics on sparse learning models are analyzed.

Preparing Medical Imaging Data for Machine Learning	RADIOLOGY			English	Review							COMPUTER-AIDED DETECTION; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; DE-IDENTIFICATION; RADIOLOGY REPORTS; CT COLONOGRAPHY; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; SYSTEM; ALGORITHM; PLATFORM	Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garter substantial interest in medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety of the. medical imaging life cycle from image exertion to diagnosis to outcome prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations). Current supervised AI methods require a curation proem for data to optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most and research group industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from small geographic areas. In addition, die preparation of data is a costly and time-intensive process, the results of which ate algorithms with limited utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new approaches to address the problem of data availability.

Accurate estimation of road maintenance effects can support the assessment of maintenance strategies and reasonable allocation of budgets and resources. Road deterioration is affected by sophisticated factors, but accurate investigation of the integrated deterioration factors is limited. This study developed a dynamic trade-off model (DTOM), a hybrid nonlinear and machine learning method, for quantifying temporally varied impacts of factors and examining maintenance effects at the network level. Pavement deterioration factors are classified into three categories: (i) historical observations of roughness, (ii) pavement age, and (iii) traffic, climate and environment factors. Their respective impacts on pavements are estimated using a non-linear least square regression, a joinpoint regression and a random forest model, respectively. Vehicle-based laser scanner monitored high-resolution deterioration data was collected for a large spatial scale road network in Western Australia from 2007 to 2018. Results show that the resurfacing and rehabilitation are essential for strategic reduction of deterioration. Twelve-year maintenance activities reduced the distress of roughness by 7.5% and increased road performance (the percentage of roads with roughness lower than 2.085 IRI) by 14.5% for the whole road network. The DTOM has great potentials in accurately assessing infrastructure maintenance effects and predicting deterioration scenarios.

Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human-AI interaction (HAII) in particular. This article proposes some directions by applying the dual-process framework of the Theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME) for studying the symbolic and enabling effects of the affordances of AI-driven media on user perceptions and experiences.

This paper proposes a new noise-assisted method, called EMD manifold (EMDM), for enhanced fault diagnosis of rotating machines. The major contribution is that the new method nonlinearly and adaptively fuses the fault-related modes containing different noise via a manifold learning algorithm, by which true fault-related transients are preserved, while fault-unrelated components including mode-mixing-induced components and the residual noise derived from both the added and self-contained noise are greatly suppressed. First, the sensitive mode is located among the modes obtained by the EMD method according to a newly proposed criterion. Then, a high-dimensional matrix is constructed of the sensitive modes obtained through a small number of EMD trials on the signals plus noise of different amplitudes. Finally, the manifold learning algorithm is performed on the high-dimensional matrix to extract intrinsic manifold of the fault-related transients. The high-dimensional matrix is repeatedly constructed with random noise added to adjust local data distribution of the matrix for adaptive EMDM feature learning. Experimental studies on gearbox and bearing faults are conducted to validate the proposed method and its enhanced performance over traditional noise-assisted EMD methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recording, modelling and understanding tactile interactions is important in the study of human behaviour and in the development of applications in healthcare and robotics. However, such studies remain challenging because existing wearable sensory interfaces are limited in terms of performance, flexibility, scalability and cost. Here, we report a textile-based tactile learning platform that can be used to record, monitor and learn human-environment interactions. The tactile textiles are created via digital machine knitting of inexpensive piezoresistive fibres, and can conform to arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. To ensure that our system is robust against variations in individual sensors, we use machine learning techniques for sensing correction and calibration. Using the platform, we capture diverse human-environment interactions (more than a million tactile frames) and show that the artificial-intelligence-powered sensing textiles can classify humans' sitting poses, motions and other interactions with the environment. We also show that the platform can recover dynamic whole-body poses, reveal environmental spatial information and discover biomechanical signatures.

J	Pfeiffer, M; Pfeil, T				Pfeiffer, Michael; Pfeil, Thomas			Deep Learning With Spiking Neurons: Opportunities and Challenges	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						neural networks; spiking neurons; neuromorphic engineering; event-based computing; deep learning; binary networks	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; OBJECT RECOGNITION; VISION; DRIVEN; MODEL; COMMUNICATION; FRAMEWORK; SPEED; BACKPROPAGATION	Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inspired by information processing in biology, where sparse and asynchronous binary signals are communicated and processed in amassively parallel fashion. SNNs on neuromorphic hardware exhibit favorable properties such as low power consumption, fast inference, and event-driven information processing. This makes them interesting candidates for the efficient implementation of deep neural networks, the method of choice for many machine learning tasks. In this review, we address the opportunities that deep spiking networks offer and investigate in detail the challenges associated with training SNNs in a way that makes them competitive with conventional deep learning, but simultaneously allows for efficient mapping to hardware. A wide range of training methods for SNNs is presented, ranging from the conversion of conventional deep networks into SNNs, constrained training before conversion, spiking variants of backpropagation, and biologically motivated variants of STDP. The goal of our review is to define a categorization of SNN training methods, and summarize their advantages and drawbacks. We further discuss relationships between SNNs and binary networks, which are becoming popular for efficient digital hardware implementation. Neuromorphic hardware platforms have great potential to enable deep spiking networks in real-world applications. We compare the suitability of various neuromorphic systems that have been developed over the past years, and investigate potential use cases. Neuromorphic approaches and conventional machine learning should not be considered simply two solutions to the same classes of problems, instead it is possible to identify and exploit their task-specific advantages. Deep SNNs offer great opportunities to work with new types of event-based sensors, exploit temporal codes and local on-chip learning, and we have so far just scratched the surface of realizing these advantages in practical applications.

Deep learning for cardiovascular medicine: a practical primer	EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL			English	Review						Big data; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Cardiovascular medicine; Precision medicine	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; PREDICTION MODELS; ESC GUIDELINES; HEART-FAILURE; BIG DATA; CLASSIFICATION; PHENOTYPES; INTELLIGENCE; DIAGNOSIS	Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) showing increasing promise in medicine, to assist in data classification, novel disease phenotyping and complex decision making. Deep learning is a form of ML typically implemented via multi-layered neural networks. Deep learning has accelerated by recent advances in computer hardware and algorithms and is increasingly applied in e-commerce, finance, and voice and image recognition to learn and classify complex datasets. The current medical literature shows both strengths and limitations of DL. Strengths of DL include its ability to automate medical image interpretation, enhance clinical decision-making, identify novel phenotypes, and select better treatment pathways in complex diseases. Deep learning may be well-suited to cardiovascular medicine in which haemodynamic and electrophysiological indices are increasingly captured on a continuous basis by wearable devices as well as image segmentation in cardiac imaging. However, DL also has significant weaknesses including difficulties in interpreting its models (the 'black-box' criticism), its need for extensive adjudicated ('labelled') data in training, lack of standardization in design, lack of data-efficiency in training, limited applicability to clinical trials, and other factors. Thus, the optimal clinical application of DL requires careful formulation of solvable problems, selection of most appropriate DL algorithms and data, and balanced interpretation of results. This review synthesizes the current state of DL for cardiovascular clinicians and investigators, and provides technical context to appreciate the promise, pitfalls, near-term challenges, and opportunities for this exciting new area.

During the tunneling process, precise cutterhead torque prediction is of vital significance for adjusting operational parameters and avoiding cutterhead jamming, which seriously affects the efficiency, cost and safety of tunneling process. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep neural network (HDNN) is presented for accurately predicting the cutterhead torque for shield tunneling machines based on the equipment operational and status parameters. To begin with, correlation analysis based on cosine similarity between the parameters and the cutterhead torque are conducted for parameter selection and input dimension reduction. Then, selected parameters are fed into the proposed hybrid deep neural network, combing convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract implicit features and sequential features. On this basis, useful deep information can be fully exploited and utilized for cutterhead torque prediction. Moreover, to further improve the prediction performance and alleviate the gradient disappearing during deep-layer network training, we integrate the residual network module into the proposed neural network. Finally, 15 different datasets constructed from the actual project data are utilized to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The results show that the coincidence degree between the predicted curves and the actual curves of the proposed HDNN is much higher than that of the existing machine learning-based and deep learning-based models. Therefore, the prediction accuracy and the generalization ability of the proposed method outperforms the other data-driven methods. Moreover, on the 15 different datasets with different geological conditions, the highest prediction accuracy of the proposed HDNN is up to 97.4%, and the average prediction accuracy is approximately 96.2%. It can be concluded that the proposed HDNN is capable of accurately predicting the cutterhead torque even under complicated geological conditions, which is provided with high industrial application value.

This field is currently experiencing a radical shift due to the advent of deep learning: deep neural networks promise improvements in prediction performance as compared to models from traditional machine learning. However, our research into the existing body of literature reveals a scarcity of research works utilizing deep learning in our discipline. Accordingly, the objectives of this overview article are as follows: (1) we review research on deep learning for business analytics from an operational point of view. (2) We motivate why researchers and practitioners from business analytics should utilize deep neural networks and review potential use cases, necessary requirements, and benefits. (3) We investigate the added value to operations research in different case studies with real data from entrepreneurial undertakings. All such cases demonstrate improvements in operational performance over traditional machine learning and thus direct value gains. (4) We provide guidelines and implications for researchers, managers and practitioners in operations research who want to advance their capabilities for business analytics with regard to deep learning. (5) Our computational experiments find that default, out-of-the-box architectures are often suboptimal and thus highlight the value of customized architectures by proposing a novel deep-embedded network.

Such an extraction influences multiple scenes, including map updating, traffic management, emergency tasks, road monitoring, and others. Therefore, a systematic review of deep learning techniques applied to common remote sensing benchmarks for road extraction is conducted in this study. The research is conducted based on four main types of deep learning methods, namely, the GANs model, deconvolutional networks, FCNs, and patch-based CNNs models. We also compare these various deep learning models applied to remote sensing datasets to show which method performs well in extracting road parts from high-resolution remote sensing images. Moreover, we describe future research directions and research gaps. Results indicate that the largest reported performance record is related to the deconvolutional nets applied to remote sensing images, and the F1 score metric of the generative adversarial network model, DenseNet method, and FCN-32 applied to UAV and Google Earth images are high: 96.08%, 95.72%, and 94.59%, respectively.

Rapid failure mode classification and quantification in batteries: A deep learning modeling framework	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Lithium-ion battery; Advanced diagnostics and prognostics; Deep learning; Machine Learning; Fast charge	LITHIUM-ION CELLS; DEGRADATION MODES; PATH DEPENDENCE; CYCLE LIFE; STABILITY; DESIGN	Unique, rapid identification and quantification of the dominant aging modes in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) with early and non-specialized test data is a significant scientific challenge. Leveraging synthetic-data, deep-learning (DL) techniques have great potential to enable fast and robust classification and quantification of battery aging modes that produce different patterns of cell aging. This study presents, for the first time, a synthetic-data-based DL modeling framework for rapid and automatic classification and quantification of battery-aging modes and resultant aging, with experimental validation of the technique. Availing synthetic dQ.dV(-1) curves for roughly 26,000 initial conditions and aging modes, the framework classified the dominant aging modes for cells undergoing fast charge in less than 100 cycles. Upon classification, the framework quantified the evolution of the aging modes, which were often not uniform with cycling, for 22 Gr/NMC532 pouch cells tested up to 600 cycles at different charging rates (1C-9C).

For traveling people, self-driving cars will be new places for engaging in infotainment services. Therefore, self-driving cars should determine themselves the infotainment contents that are likely to entertain their passengers. However, the choice of infotainment contents depends on passengers' features such as age, emotion, and gender. Also, retrieving infotainment contents at data center can hinder infotainment services due to high end-to-end delay. To address these challenges, we propose infotainment caching in self-driving cars, where caching decisions are based on passengers' features obtained using deep learning. First, we proposed deep learning models to predict the contents need to be cached in self-driving cars and close proximity of self-driving cars in multi-access edge computing servers attached to roadside units. Second, we proposed a communication model for retrieving infotainment contents to cache. Third, we proposed a caching model for retrieved contents. Fourth, we proposed a computation model for the cached contents, where cached contents can be served in different formats/qualities based on demands. Finally, we proposed an optimization problem whose goal is to link the proposed models into one optimization problem that minimizes the content downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a block successive majorization-minimization technique is applied. The simulation results show that the accuracy of prediction for the contents that need to be cached is 97.82% and our approach can minimize the delay.

J	Kebria, PM; Khosravi, A; Salaken, SM; Nahavandi, S				Kebria, Parham M.; Khosravi, Abbas; Salaken, Syed Moshfeq; Nahavandi, Saeid			Deep imitation learning for autonomous vehicles based on convolutional neural networks	IEEE-CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA			English	Article						Autonomous vehicles; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; imitation learning	CNN; CLASSIFICATION; NIGHTTIME; TREES	Providing autonomous systems with an effective quantity and quality of information from a desired task is challenging. In particular, autonomous vehicles, must have a reliable vision of their workspace to robustly accomplish driving functions. Speaking of machine vision, deep learning techniques, and specifically convolutional neural networks, have been proven to be the state of the art technology in the field. As these networks typically involve millions of parameters and elements, designing an optimal architecture for deep learning structures is a difficult task which is globally under investigation by researchers. This study experimentally evaluates the impact of three major architectural properties of convolutional networks, including the number of layers, filters, and filter size on their performance. In this study, several models with different properties are developed, equally trained, and then applied to an autonomous car in a realistic simulation environment. A new ensemble approach is also proposed to calculate and update weights for the models regarding their mean squared error values. Based on design properties, performance results are reported and compared for further investigations. Surprisingly, the number of filters itself does not largely affect the performance efficiency. As a result, proper allocation of filters with different kernel sizes through the layers introduces a considerable improvement in the performance. Achievements of this study will provide the researchers with a clear clue and direction in designing optimal network architectures for deep learning purposes.

J	Deutsch, J; He, D				Deutsch, Jason; He, David			Using Deep Learning-Based Approach to Predict Remaining Useful Life of Rotating Components	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bearing; condition monitoring; gearbox; machine learning; prediction methods; prognostics	NETWORKS	In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, prognostic and health management (PHM) systems are used to collect massive real-time data from mechanical equipment. PHM big data has the characteristics of large-volume, diversity, and high-velocity. Effectively mining features from such data and accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the rotating components with new advanced methods become issues in PHM. Traditional data driven prognostics is based on shallow learning architectures, requires establishing explicit model equations and much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and prognostic expertise, and therefore is limited in the age of big data. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for RUL prediction of rotating components with big data. The presented approach is tested and validated using data collected from a gear test rig and bearing run-to-failure tests and compared with existing PHM methods. The test results show the promising RUL prediction performance of the deep learning-based approach.

Automated Deep Transfer Learning-Based Approach for Detection of COVID-19 Infection in Chest X-rays	IRBM			English	Article						Deep learning; COVID-19; Chest x-ray; Transfer learning		The most widely used novel coronavirus (COVID-19) detection technique is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR kits are costly and take 6-9 hours to confirm infection in the patient. Due to less sensitivity of RT-PCR, it provides high false-negative results. To resolve this problem, radiological imaging techniques such as chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) are used to detect and diagnose COVID-19. In this paper, chest X-rays is preferred over CT scan. The reason behind this is that X-rays machines are available in most of the hospitals. X-rays machines are cheaper than the CT scan machine. Besides this, X-rays has low ionizing radiations than CT scan. COVID-19 reveals some radiological signatures that can be easily detected through chest X-rays. For this, radiologists are required to analyze these signatures. However, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Hence, there is a need to automate the analysis of chest X-rays. The automatic analysis of chest X-rays can be done through deep learning-based approaches, which may accelerate the analysis time. These approaches can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine-tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. However, these approaches applied to chest X-rays are very limited. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to develop an automated deep transfer learning-based approach for detection of COVID-19 infection in chest X-rays by using the extreme version of the Inception (Xception) model.

However, fault-tolerant on-chip learning remains a challenge in neuromorphic systems. This study presents the first scalable neuromorphic fault-tolerant context-dependent learning (FCL) hardware framework. We show how this system can learn associations between stimulation and response in two context-dependent learning tasks from experimental neuroscience, despite possible faults in the hardware nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our novel fault-tolerant neuromorphic spike routing scheme can avoid multiple fault nodes successfully and can enhance the maximum throughput of the neuromorphic network by 0.9%-16.1% in comparison with previous studies. By utilizing the real-time computational capabilities and multiple-fault-tolerant property of the proposed system, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the spiking activities of neuromorphic networks can be readily explored. In addition, the proposed system can be applied in real-time learning and decision-making applications, brain-machine integration, and the investigation of brain cognition during learning.

J	Diro, AA; Chilamkurti, N				Diro, Abebe Abeshu; Chilamkurti, Naveen			Distributed attack detection scheme using deep learning approach for Internet of Things	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Internet of Things; Fog networks; Smart cities	CODE	Cybersecurity continues to be a serious issue for any sector in the cyberspace as the number of security breaches is increasing from time to time. It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This goal can be achieved using an optimal machine learning model with rich healthcare data on heart diseases. Various systems based on machine learning have been presented recently to predict and diagnose heart disease. However, these systems cannot handle high-dimensional datasets due to the lack of a smart framework that can use different sources of data for heart disease prediction. In addition, the existing systems utilize conventional techniques to select features from a dataset and compute a general weight for them based on their significance. These methods have also failed to enhance the performance of heart disease diagnosis. In this paper, a smart healthcare system is proposed for heart disease prediction using ensemble deep learning and feature fusion approaches. First, the feature fusion method combines the extracted features from both sensor data and electronic medical records to generate valuable healthcare data. Second, the information gain technique eliminates irrelevant and redundant features, and selects the important ones, which decreases the computational burden and enhances the system performance. In addition, the conditional probability approach computes a specific feature weight for each class, which further improves system performance. Finally, the ensemble deep learning model is trained for heart disease prediction. The proposed system is evaluated with heart disease data and compared with traditional classifiers based on feature fusion, feature selection, and weighting techniques. The proposed system obtains accuracy of 98.5%, which is higher than existing systems. This result shows that our system is more effective for the prediction of heart disease, in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods.

Since the introduction of deep learning (DL) in civil engineering, particularly in SHM, this emerging and promising tool has attracted significant attention among researchers. The main goal of this paper is to review the latest publications in SHM using emerging DL-based methods and provide readers with an overall understanding of various SHM applications. After a brief introduction, an overview of various DL methods (e.g., deep neural networks, transfer learning, etc.) is presented. The procedure and application of vibration-based, vision-based monitoring, along with some of the recent technologies used for SHM, such as sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), etc. are discussed. The review concludes with prospects and potential limitations of DL-based methods in SHM applications.

However, deep learning methods have shown great promise in not only providing excellent performance for complex and non-linear control problems, but also in generalising previously learned rules to new scenarios. For these reasons, the use of deep learning for vehicle control is becoming increasingly popular. Although important advancements have been achieved in this field, these works have not been fully summarised. This paper surveys a wide range of research works reported in the literature which aim to control a vehicle through deep learning methods. Although there exists overlap between control and perception, the focus of this paper is on vehicle control, rather than the wider perception problem which includes tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. The paper identifies the strengths and limitations of available deep learning methods through comparative analysis and discusses the research challenges in terms of computation, architecture selection, goal specification, generalisation, verification and validation, as well as safety. Overall, this survey brings timely and topical information to a rapidly evolving field relevant to intelligent transportation systems.

The realization of practical optical structures and devices is a complex problem due to the multitude of constraints on their optical performance, materials, scalability, and experimental tolerances, all of which are requirements implying large optimization spaces. However, despite the complexity of the process, to date, almost all nanophotonic structures are designed either intuitively or based on a priori selected topologies, and by adjusting a limited number of parameters. These intuition-based models are limited to ad hoc needs and have narrow applicability and predictive power, with the exhaustive parameter searches often performed manually. Since the comprehensive search in hyper-dimensional design space is highly resource-heavy, multi-objective optimization has so far been almost impossible. Humans' restrained capacity to think hyper-dimensionally also limits the perception of multivariate optimization models, and, therefore, advanced machinery is needed to manage the multi-domain, hyper-dimensional design parameter space. In this work, we merge the topology optimization method with deep learning algorithms, such as adversarial autoencoders, and show substantial improvement of the optimization process in terms of computational time (4900 times faster) and final devices efficiencies (similar to 98%) by providing unparalleled control of the compact design space representations. By enabling efficient, global optimization searches within complex landscapes, the proposed compact hyperparametric representations could become crucial for multi-constrained problems. The proposed approach could enable a much broader scope of the optimal designs and data-driven materials synthesis that goes beyond photonic and optoelectronic applications.

However, its usage in communications systems has not been well explored. This paper investigates the use of the DL in modulation classification, which is a major task in many communications systems. The DL relies on a massive amount of data and, for research and applications, this can be easily available in communications systems. Furthermore, unlike the ML, the DL has the advantage of not requiring manual feature selections, which significantly reduces the task complexity in modulation classification. In this paper, we use two convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL models, AlexNet and GoogLeNet. Specifically, we develop several methods to represent modulated signals in data formats with gridlike topologies for the CNN. The impacts of representation on classification performance are also analyzed. In addition, comparisons with traditional cumulant and ML-based algorithms are presented. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance advantage and application feasibility of the DL-based approach for modulation classification.

In centrality methods, researchers are required to design a score function which is based on prior knowledge, yet is usually not sufficient to capture the complexity of biological information. In machine learning-based methods, some selected biological features cannot represent the complete properties of biological information as they lack a computational framework to automatically select features. To tackle these problems, we propose a deep learning framework to automatically learn biological features without prior knowledge. We use node2vec technique to automatically learn a richer representation of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network topologies than a score function. Bidirectional long short term memory cells are applied to capture non-local relationships in gene expression data. For subcellular localization information, we exploit a high dimensional indicator vector to characterize their feature. To evaluate the performance of our method, we tested it on PPI network of S. cerevisiae. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method is better than traditional centrality methods and is superior to existing machine learning-based methods. To explore which of the three types of biological information is the most vital element, we conduct an ablation study by removing each component in turn. Our results show that the PPI network embedding contributes most to the improvement. In addition, gene expression profiles and subcellular localization information are also helpful to improve the performance in identification of essential proteins.

Among the existing techniques, stereo matching remains one of the most widely used in the literature due to its strong connection to the human binocular system. Traditionally, stereo-based depth estimation has been addressed through matching hand-crafted features across multiple images. Despite the extensive amount of research, these traditional techniques still suffer in the presence of highly textured areas, large uniform regions, and occlusions. Motivated by their growing success in solving various 2D and 3D vision problems, deep learning for stereo-based depth estimation has attracted a growing interest from the community, with more than 150 papers published in this area between 2014 and 2019. This new generation of methods has demonstrated a significant leap in performance, enabling applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this new and continuously growing field of research, summarize the most commonly used pipelines, and discuss their benefits and limitations. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for deep learning-based stereo for depth estimation research.

J	Yan, ZQ; Yang, X; Cheng, KT				Yan, Zengqiang; Yang, Xin; Cheng, Kwang-Ting			A Three-Stage Deep Learning Model for Accurate Retinal Vessel Segmentation	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI)	SEP 10, 2017	Quebec City, CANADA			Deep learning; vessel segmentation; imbalance problem; retinal image analysis	BLOOD-VESSELS; MATCHED-FILTER; IMAGES; EXTRACTION	Automatic retinal vessel segmentation is a fundamental step in the diagnosis of eye-related diseases, in which both thick vessels and thin vessels are important features for symptom detection. All existing deep learning models attempt to segment both types of vessels simultaneously by using a unified pixel-wise loss that treats all vessel pixels with equal importance. Due to the highly imbalanced ratio between thick vessels and thin vessels (namely the majority of vessel pixels belong to thick vessels), the pixel-wise loss would be dominantly guided by thick vessels and relatively little influence comes from thin vessels, often leading to low segmentation accuracy for thin vessels. To address the imbalance problem, in this paper, we explore to segment thick vessels and thin vessels separately by proposing a three-stage deep learning model. The vessel segmentation task is divided into three stages, namely thick vessel segmentation, thin vessel segmentation, and vessel fusion. As better discriminative features could be learned for separate segmentation of thick vessels and thin vessels, this process minimizes the negative influence caused by their highly imbalanced ratio. The final vessel fusion stage refines the results by further identifying nonvessel pixels and improving the overall vessel thickness consistency. The experiments on public datasets DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 clearly demonstrate that the proposed three-stage deep learning model outperforms the current state-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods.

However, conventional graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithms usually depend on a fixed weight graph called similarity matrix, which seriously affects the subsequent feature extraction process. In this paper, a novel structured optimal graph based sparse feature extraction (SOGSFE) method for semi-supervised learning is proposed. In the proposed method, the local structure learning, sparse representation, and label propagation are simultaneously framed to perform data dimensionality reduction. In particular the similarity matrix and the projection matrix are obtained by an iterative calculation manner. The experimental results on several public image datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Experimental Review on Deep Learning Architectures for Time Series Forecasting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Review						Deep learning; forecasting; time series; review	NEURAL DYNAMIC CLASSIFICATION; CRACK DETECTION; NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODEL; ENERGY; LSTM; DEMAND	In recent years, deep learning techniques have outperformed traditional models in many machine learning tasks. Deep neural networks have successfully been applied to address time series forecasting problems, which is a very important topic in data mining. They have proved to be an effective solution given their capacity to automatically learn the temporal dependencies present in time series. However, selecting the most convenient type of deep neural network and its parametrization is a complex task that requires considerable expertise. Therefore, there is a need for deeper studies on the suitability of all existing architectures for different forecasting tasks. In this work, we face two main challenges: a comprehensive review of the latest works using deep learning for time series forecasting and an experimental study comparing the performance of the most popular architectures. The comparison involves a thorough analysis of seven types of deep learning models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate the rankings and distribution of results obtained with the proposed models under many different architecture configurations and training hyperparameters. The datasets used comprise more than 50,000 time series divided into 12 different forecasting problems. By training more than 38,000 models on these data, we provide the most extensive deep learning study for time series forecasting. Among all studied models, the results show that long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional networks (CNN) are the best alternatives, with LSTMs obtaining the most accurate forecasts. CNNs achieve comparable performance with less variability of results under different parameter configurations, while also being more efficient.

J	Zhang, DW; Huang, GH; Zhang, Q; Han, JG; Han, JW; Yu, YZ				Zhang, Dingwen; Huang, Guohai; Zhang, Qiang; Han, Jungong; Han, Junwei; Yu, Yizhou			Cross-modality deep feature learning for brain tumor segmentation	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Brain tumor segmentation; Cross-modality feature transition; Cross-modality feature fusion; Feature learning	NETWORKS	Recent advances in machine learning and prevalence of digital medical images have opened up an oppor-tunity to address the challenging brain tumor segmentation (BTS) task by using deep convolutional neural networks. However, different from the RGB image data that are very widespread, the medical image data used in brain tumor segmentation are relatively scarce in terms of the data scale but contain the richer information in terms of the modality property. To this end, this paper proposes a novel cross-modality deep feature learning framework to segment brain tumors from the multi-modality MRI data. The core idea is to mine rich patterns across the multi-modality data to make up for the insufficient data scale. The proposed cross-modality deep feature learning framework consists of two learning processes: the cross-modality feature transition (CMFT) process and the cross-modality feature fusion (CMFF) process, which aims at learning rich feature representations by transiting knowledge across different modality data and fusing knowledge from different modality data, respectively. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the BraTS benchmarks, which show that the proposed cross-modality deep feature learning framework can effectively improve the brain tumor segmentation performance when compared with the baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods.

A survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning	JOURNAL OF BIG DATA			English	Article						Data Augmentation; Big data; Image data; Deep Learning; GANs	CLASSIFICATION	Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.

Among smart devices, android devices are the most targeted devices by malware because of their high popularity. This paper proposes a novel framework for android malware detection. Our framework uses various kinds of features to reflect the properties of android applications from various aspects, and the features are refined using our existence-based or similarity-based feature extraction method for effective feature representation on malware detection. Besides, a multimodal deep learning method is proposed to be used as a malware detection model. This paper is the first study of the multimodal deep learning to be used in the android malware detection. With our detection model, it was possible to maximize the benefits of encompassing multiple feature types. To evaluate the performance, we carried out various experiments with a total of 41 260 samples. We compared the accuracy of our model with that of other deep neural network models. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework in various aspects including the efficiency in model updates, the usefulness of diverse features, and our feature representation method. In addition, we compared the performance of our framework with those of other existing methods including deep learning-based methods.

Early NER systems got a huge success in achieving good performance with the cost of human engineering in designing domain-specific features and rules. In recent years, deep learning, empowered by continuous real-valued vector representations and semantic composition through nonlinear processing, has been employed in NER systems, yielding stat-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on existing deep learning techniques for NER. We first introduce NER resources, including tagged NER corpora and off-the-shelf NER tools. Then, we systematically categorize existing works based on a taxonomy along three axes: distributed representations for input, context encoder, and tag decoder. Next, we survey the most representative methods for recent applied techniques of deep learning in new NER problem settings and applications. Finally, we present readers with the challenges faced by NER systems and outline future directions in this area.

In the meantime, it starts to penetrate other disciplines, such as biology, genetics, materials science, and physics. Here, we report a deep-learning-based model, comprising two bidirectional neural networks assembled by a partial stacking strategy, to automatically design and optimize three-dimensional chiral metamaterials with strong chiroptical responses at predesignated wavelengths. The model can help to discover the intricate, nonintuitive relationship between a metamaterial structure and its optical responses from a number of training examples, which circumvents the time-consuming, case-by-case numerical simulations in conventional metamaterial designs. This approach not only realizes the forward prediction of optical performance much more accurately and efficiently but also enables one to inversely retrieve designs from given requirements. Our results demonstrate that such a data-driven model can be applied as a very powerful tool in studying complicated light-matter interactions and accelerating the on-demand design of nanophotonic devices, systems, and architectures for real world applications.

Developing predictive models plays an important role in interpreting complex real-world elements. With the sharp increase in the quantity and dimensionality of data, new challenges, such as extracting deep features and recognizing deep latent patterns, have emerged, demanding novel approaches and effective solutions. Deep learning, composed of multiple processing layers to learn with multiple levels of abstraction, is, now, commonly deployed for overcoming the newly arisen difficulties. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art developments in deep learning for time series prediction. Based on modeling for the perspective of conditional or joint probability, we categorize them into discriminative, generative, and hybrids models. Experiments are implemented on both benchmarks and real-world data to elaborate the performance of the representative deep learning-based prediction methods. Finally, we conclude with comments on possible future perspectives and ongoing challenges with time series prediction.

Such brilliant automation of mundane tasks requires a considerable amount of user data in digital format, which, in turn, makes IoT networks an open source of personally identifiable information data for malicious attackers to steal, manipulate, and perform nefarious activities. A huge interest has been developed over the past years in applying machine learning (ML)-assisted approaches in the IoT security space. However, the assumption in many current works is that big training data are widely available and transferable to the main server because data are born at the edge and are generated continuously by IoT devices. This is to say that classic ML works on the legacy set of entire data located on a central server, which makes it the least preferred option for domains with privacy concerns on user data. To address this issue, we propose the federated-learning (FL)-based anomaly detection approach to proactively recognize intrusion in IoT networks using decentralized on-device data. Our approach uses federated training rounds on gated recurrent units (GRUs) models and keeps the data intact on local IoT devices by sharing only the learned weights with the central server of FL. Also, the approach's ensembler part aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the global ML model's accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the classic/centralized machine learning (non-FL) versions in securing the privacy of user data and provides an optimal accuracy rate in attack detection.

Pathways and challenges of the application of artificial intelligence to geohazards modelling	GONDWANA RESEARCH			English	Review						Machine learning; Deep learning; Geo hazards; Physical models; Explainable AI	FLOOD SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT; MACHINE LEARNING-METHODS; DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; DROUGHT; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in geohazard modelling has been rapidly growing in recent years, a trend that is observed in several research and application areas thanks to recent advances in AI. As a result, the increasing dependence on data driven studies has made its prac-tical applications towards geohazards (landslides, debris flows, earthquakes, droughts, floods, glacier studies) an interesting prospect. These aforementioned geohazards were responsible for roughly 80% of the economic loss in the past two decades caused by all natural hazards. The present study analyses the various domains of geohazards which have benefited from classical machine learning approaches and highlights the future course of direction in this field. The emergence of deep learning has fulfilled several gaps in: i) classification; ii) seasonal forecasting as well as forecasting at longer lead times; iii) temporal based change detection. Apart from the usual challenges of dataset availability, climate change and anthropogenic activities, this review paper emphasizes that the future studies should focus on con-secutive events along with integration of physical models. The recent catastrophe in Japan and Australia makes a compelling argument to focus towards consecutive events. The availability of higher temporal resolution and multi-hazard dataset will prove to be essential, but the key would be to integrate it with physical models which would improve our understanding of the mechanism involved both in single and consecutive hazard scenario. Geohazards would eventually be a data problem, like geosciences, and therefore it is essential to develop models that would be capable of handling large voluminous data. The future works should also revolve towards interpretable models with the hope of providing a reason-able explanation of the results, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of Explainable AI.

An energy approach to the solution of partial differential equations in computational mechanics via machine learning: Concepts, implementation and applications	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Physics informed; Deep neural networks; Energy approach		Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental to model different phenomena in science and engineering mathematically. Solving them is a crucial step towards a precise knowledge of the behavior of natural and engineered systems. In general, in order to solve PDEs that represent real systems to an acceptable degree, analytical methods are usually not enough. One has to resort to discretization methods. For engineering problems, probably the best-known option is the finite element method (FEM). However, powerful alternatives such as mesh-free methods and Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) are also available. The fundamental idea is to approximate the solution of the PDE by means of functions specifically built to have some desirable properties. In this contribution, we explore Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as an option for approximation. They have shown impressive results in areas such as visual recognition. DNNs are regarded here as function approximation machines. There is great flexibility to define their structure and important advances in the architecture and the efficiency of the algorithms to implement them make DNNs a very interesting alternative to approximate the solution of a PDE. We concentrate on applications that have an interest for Computational Mechanics. Most contributions explore this possibility have adopted a collocation strategy. In this work, we concentrate on mechanical problems and analyze the energetic format of the PDE. The energy of a mechanical system seems to be the natural loss function for a machine learning method to approach a mechanical problem. In order to prove the concepts, we deal with several problems and explore the capabilities of the method for applications in engineering. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Identification of Suicide Attempt Risk Factors in a National US Survey Using Machine Learning	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ALCOHOL-USE DISORDER; HEALTH-CARE CONTACTS; INTERVIEW SCHEDULE AUDADIS; MENTAL-HEALTH; DRUG MODULES; SELF-HARM; RELIABILITY; DEPRESSION; METAANALYSIS; PREDICTION	IMPORTANCE Because more than one-third of people making nonfatal suicide attempts do not receive mental health treatment, it is essential to extend suicide attempt risk factors beyond high-risk clinical populations to the general adult population. OBJECTIVE To identify future suicide attempt risk factors in the general population using a data-driven machine learning approach including more than 2500 questions from a large, nationally representative survey of US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data came from wave 1 (2001 to 2002) and wave 2 (2004 to 2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). NESARC is a face-to-face longitudinal survey conducted with a national representative sample of noninstitutionalized civilian population 18 years and older in the US. The cumulative response rate across both waves was 70.2% resulting in 34 653 wave 2 interviews. A balanced random forest was trained using cross-validation to develop a suicide attempt risk model. Out-of-fold model prediction was used to assess model performance, including the area under the receiver operator curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Survey design and nonresponse weights allowed estimates to be representative of the US civilian population based on the 2000 census. Analyses were performed between May 15, 2019, and June 10, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Attempted suicide in the 3 years between wave 1 and wave 2 interviews. RESULTS Of 34 653 participants, 20 089 were female (weighted proportion, 52.1%). The weighted mean (SD) age was 45.1 (17.3) years at wave 1 and 48.2 (17.3) years at wave 2. Attempted suicide during the 3 years between wave 1 and wave 2 interviews was self-reported by 222 of 34 653 participants (0.6%). Using survey questions measured at wave 1, the suicide attempt risk model yielded a cross-validated area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.857 with a sensitivity of 85.3% (95% CI, 79.8-89.7) and a specificity of 73.3% (95% CI, 72.8-73.8) at an optimized threshold. The model identified 1.8% of the US population to be at a 10% or greater risk of suicide attempt. The most important risk factors were 3 questions about previous suicidal ideation or behavior; 3 items from the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, namely feeling downhearted, doing activities less carefully, or accomplishing less because of emotional problems; younger age; lower educational achievement; and recent financial crisis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, after searching through more than 2500 survey questions, several well-known risk factors of suicide attempt were confirmed, such as previous suicidal behaviors and ideation, and new risks were identified, including functional impairment resulting from mental disorders and socioeconomic disadvantage. These results may help guide future clinical assessment and the development of new suicide risk scales.

These loT devices and nodes are a valuable target for cyber criminals, particularly state-sponsored or nation state actors. A common attack vector is the use of malware. In this paper, we present a deep learning based method to detect Internet Of Battlefield Things (IoBT) malware via the device's Operational Code (OpCode) sequence. We transmute OpCodes into a vector space and apply a deep Eigenspace learning approach to classify malicious and benign applications. We also demonstrate the robustness of our proposed approach in malware detection and its sustainability against junk code insertion attacks. Lastly, we make available our malware sample on Github, which hopefully will benefit future research efforts (e.g., to facilitate evaluation of future malware detection approaches).

Deep learning in radiology: An overview of the concepts and a survey of the state of the art with focus on MRI	JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Review						deep learning; machine learning; artificial intelligence; convolutional neural networks; radiology; medical imaging	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; BREAST-CANCER; ENHANCEMENT DYNAMICS; SURVIVAL; IMAGES; RADIOGENOMICS; SEGMENTATION; FEATURES; MODELS	Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where networks of simple interconnected units are used to extract patterns from data in order to solve complex problems. Deep-learning algorithms have shown groundbreaking performance in a variety of sophisticated tasks, especially those related to images. They have often matched or exceeded human performance. Since the medical field of radiology mainly relies on extracting useful information from images, it is a very natural application area for deep learning, and research in this area has rapidly grown in recent years. In this article, we discuss the general context of radiology and opportunities for application of deep-learning algorithms. We also introduce basic concepts of deep learning, including convolutional neural networks. Then, we present a survey of the research in deep learning applied to radiology.

J	Mao, Q; Hu, F; Hao, Q				Mao, Qian; Hu, Fei; Hao, Qi			Deep Learning for Intelligent Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS			English	Article						Wireless networks; deep learning (DL); deep reinforcement learning (DRL); protocol layers; performance optimization	INTERFERENCE ALIGNMENT; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FEATURES	As a promising machine learning tool to handle the accurate pattern recognition from complex raw data, deep learning (DL) is becoming a powerful method to add intelligence to wireless networks with large-scale topology and complex radio conditions. DL uses many neural network layers to achieve a brain-like acute feature extraction from high-dimensional raw data. It can be used to find the network dynamics (such as hotspots, interference distribution, congestion points, traffic bottlenecks, spectrum availability, etc.) based on the analysis of a large amount of network parameters (such as delay, loss rate, link signal-to-noise ratio, etc.). Therefore, DL can analyze extremely complex wireless networks with many nodes and dynamic link quality. This paper performs a comprehensive survey of the applications of DL algorithms for different network layers, including physical layer modulation/coding, data link layer access control/resource allocation, and routing layer path search, and traffic balancing. The use of DL to enhance other network functions, such as network security, sensing data compression, etc., is also discussed. Moreover, the challenging unsolved research issues in this field are discussed in detail, which represent the future research trends of DL-based wireless networks. This paper can help the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art of the DL-based wireless network designs, and select interesting unsolved issues to pursue in their research.

A spatiotemporal deep learning approach for citywide short-term crash risk prediction with multi-source data	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Multi-source data; Spatiotemporal; Crash risk prediction; Deep learning	SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; TRAFFIC CRASHES; TIME PREDICTION; BIG DATA; REGRESSION; FREQUENCY	The primary objective of this study is to investigate how the deep learning approach contributes to citywide short-term crash risk prediction by leveraging multi-source datasets. This study uses data collected from Manhattan in New York City to illustrate the procedure. The following multiple datasets are collected: crash data, large-scale taxi GPS data, road network attributes, land use features, population data and weather data. A spatiotemporal convolutional long short-term memory network (STCL-Net) is proposed for predicting the city-wide short-term crash risk. A total of nine prediction tasks are conducted and compared, including weekly, daily and hourly models with 8 x 3, 15 x 5 and 30 x 10 grids, respectively. The results suggest that the prediction performance of the proposed model decreases as the spatiotemporal resolution of prediction task increases. Moreover, four commonly-used econometric models, and four state-of-the-art machine-learning models are selected as benchmark methods to compare with the proposed STCL-Net for all the crash risk prediction tasks. The comparative analyses suggest that in general the proposed STCL-Net outperforms the benchmark methods for different crash risk prediction tasks in terms of higher prediction accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate. The results verify that the proposed spatiotemporal deep learning approach performs better at capturing the spatiotemporal characteristics for the citywide short-term crash risk prediction. In addition, the comparative analyses also reveal that econometric models perform better than machine-learning models in weekly crash risk prediction tasks, while they exhibit worse results than machine-learning models in daily crash risk prediction tasks. The results can potentially guide transportation safety engineers to select appropriate methods for different crash risk prediction tasks.

While, how to transfer a deep network trained by historical failure data for prediction of a new object is rarely researched. In this paper, a deep transfer learning (DTL) network based on sparse autoencoder (SAE) is presented. In the DTL method, three transfer strategies, that is, weight transfer, transfer learning of hidden feature, and weight update, are used to transfer an SAE trained by historical failure data to a new object. By these strategies, prediction of the new object without supervised information for training is achieved. Moreover, the learned features by deep transfer network for the new object share joint and similar characteristic to that of historical failure data, which is beneficial to accurate prediction. Case study on remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of cutting tool is performed to validate effectiveness of the DTL method. An SAE network is first trained by run-to-failure data with RUL information of a cutting tool in an off-line process. The trained network is then transferred to a new tool under operation for on-line RUL prediction. The prediction result with high accuracy shows advantage of the DTL method for RUL prediction.

It is based on the connection of the users to servers located on the edge of the network, which is especially relevant for real-time applications that demand minimal latency. In order to guarantee a resource-efficient MEC (which, for example, could mean improved Quality of Service for users or lower costs for service providers), it is important to consider certain aspects of the service model, such as where to offload the tasks generated by the devices, how many resources to allocate to each user (specially in the wired or wireless device-server communication) and how to handle inter-server communication. However, in the MEC scenarios with many and varied users, servers and applications, these problems are characterized by parameters with exceedingly high levels of dimensionality, resulting in too much data to be processed and complicating the task of finding efficient configurations. This will be particularly troublesome when 5G networks and Internet of Things roll out, with their massive amounts of devices. To address this concern, the best solution is to utilize Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which enable the computer to draw conclusions and make predictions based on existing data without human supervision, leading to quick near-optimal solutions even in problems with high dimensionality. Indeed, in scenarios with too much data and too many parameters, ML algorithms are often the only feasible alternative. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on the use of ML in MEC systems is provided, offering an insight into the current progress of this research area. Furthermore, helpful guidance is supplied by pointing out which MEC challenges can be solved by ML solutions, what are the current trending algorithms in frontier ML research and how they could be used in MEC. These pieces of information should prove fundamental in encouraging future research that combines ML and MEC.

In this paper, we propose a new flood susceptibility mapping technique. We employ new ensemble models based on bagging as a meta-classifier and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) coarse, cosine, cubic, and weighted base classifiers to spatially forecast flooding in the Haraz watershed in northern Iran. We identified flood-prone areas using data from Sentinel-1 sensor. We then selected 10 conditioning factors to spatially predict floods and assess their predictive power using the Relief Attribute Evaluation (RFAE) method. Model validation was performed using two statistical error indices and the area under the curve (AUC). Our results show that the Bagging-Cubic-KNN ensemble model outperformed other ensemble models. It decreased the overfitting and variance problems in the training dataset and enhanced the prediction accuracy of the Cubic-KNN model (AUC=0.660). We therefore recommend that the Bagging-Cubic-KNN model be more widely applied for the sustainable management of flood-prone areas.

Deep learning approaches for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems: A survey, taxonomy, and open issues	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intrusion detection; Anomaly detection; Deep learning	NETWORK	The massive growth of data that are transmitted through a variety of devices and communication protocols have raised serious security concerns, which have increased the importance of developing advanced intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Deep learning is an advanced branch of machine learning, composed of multiple layers of neurons that represent the learning process. Deep learning can cope with large-scale data and has shown success in different fields. Therefore, researchers have paid more attention to investigating deep learning for intrusion detection. This survey comprehensively reviews and compares the key previous deep learning-focused cybersecurity surveys. Through an extensive review, this survey provides a novel fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based IDSs with respect to different facets, including input data, detection, deployment, and evaluation strategies. Each facet is further classified according to different criteria. This survey also compares and discusses the related experimental solutions proposed as deep learning-based IDSs. By analysing the experimental studies, this survey discusses the role of deep learning in intrusion detection, the impact of intrusion detection datasets, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The findings demonstrate that further effort is required to improve the current state-of-the art. Finally, open research challenges are identified, and future research directions for deep learning-based IDSs are recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automated algorithms for estimating these quantities have been less accurate than estimates by human experts, which are problematic for processing large data volumes. Here we train convolutional neural networks to measure both quantities, which learn directly from seismograms without the need for feature extraction. The networks are trained on 18.2 million manually picked seismograms for the Southern California region. Through cross validation on 1.2 million independent seismograms, the differences between the automated and manual picks have a standard deviation of 0.023s. The polarities determined by the classifier have a precision of 95% when compared with analyst-determined polarities. We show that the classifier picks more polarities overall than the analysts, without sacrificing quality, resulting in almost double the number of focal mechanisms. The remarkable precision of the trained networks indicates that they can perform as well, or better, than expert seismologists.

While many predictive models have been already proposed to perform this task, the area of deep learning algorithms remains yet unexplored. To fill this scientific gap, we propose four different deep learning models for predicting electricity prices and we show how they lead to improvements in predictive accuracy. In addition, we also consider that, despite the large number of proposed methods for predicting electricity prices, an extensive benchmark is still missing. To tackle that, we compare and analyze the accuracy of 27 common approaches for electricity price forecasting. Based on the benchmark results, we show how the proposed deep learning models outperform the state-of-the-art methods and obtain results that are statistically significant. Finally, using the same results, we also show that: (i) machine learning methods yield, in general, a better accuracy than statistical models; (ii) moving average terms do not improve the predictive accuracy; (iii) hybrid models do not outperform their simpler counterparts.

However, the BLS is mainly used in supervised learning, which greatly limits the applicability of the BLS. And the obtained data is less labeled data, but is a large number of unlabeled data. Therefore, the BLS is extended based on the semi-supervised learning of manifold regularization framework to propose a semi-supervised broad learning system (SS-BLS). Firstly, the features are extracted from labeled and unlabeled data by building feature nodes and enhancement nodes. Then the manifold regularization framework is used to construct Laplacian matrix. Next, the feature nodes, enhancement nodes and Laplacian matrix are combined to construct the objective function, which is effectively solved by ridge regression in order to obtain the output coefficients. Finally, the validity of the SS-BLS is verified by three different complex data of G50C, MNIST, and NORB, respectively. The experiment result show that the SS-BLS can achieve higher classification accuracy for different complex data, takes on fast operation speed and strong generalization ability.

Predicting Remaining Useful Life of Rolling Bearings Based on Deep Feature Representation and Transfer Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Correlation coefficient; deep learning (DL); remaining useful life (RUL) prediction; transfer component analysis (TCA); transfer learning	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS SCHEME; ROTATING MACHINERY; PROGNOSTICS; NETWORK	For the data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction for rolling bearings, the traditional machine learning-based methods generally provide insufficient feature representation and adaptive extraction. Although deep learning-based RUL prediction methods can solve these problems to some extent, they still do not yield satisfactory predictive results due to less degradation data and inconsistent data distribution among different bearings. To solve these problems, a new RUL prediction method based on deep feature representation and transfer learning is proposed in this paper. This method includes an off-line stage and an online stage. In the off-line stage, the Hilbert Huang transform marginal spectra of the raw vibration signal of auxiliary bearings are first calculated as the input, and then contractive denoising autoencoder is introduced to extract deep features with good and stable fault representation. Second, by using the obtained deep features and Pearson correlation coefficient, a new health condition assessment method is proposed to divide the whole life of each bearing into a normal state and a fast-degradation state. Finally, using the extracted deep features and their RUL values, an RUL prediction model for the fast-degradation state is trained by means of a least-square support vector machine. In the online stage, a kind of transfer learning algorithm, i.e., transfer component analysis, is introduced to sequentially adjust the features of target bearing from auxiliary bearings, and then the corresponding RUL is predicted using the corrected features. Results using the PHM Challenging 2012 data set show a significant performance improvement when using the proposed method in terms of predictive accuracy and numerical stability.

In this article, a hierarchic quantum mechanics-based framework is investigated to implement both the feature extraction and classification in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. First, the classical EEG signal dataset is prepared as a quantum state while the sign of the data point is preserved. The prepared quantum state is then evolved with the quantum wavelet packet transformation (QWPT) and the wavelet packet energy entropy (WPEE) feature is extracted as the input of the subsequent quantum classifier. We finally propose the improved quantum support vector machine with the arbitrary nonlinear kernel, which is employed to predict the label of the EEG signal. The complexity analysis indicates that the proposed framework provides exponential speedup over the same structured classical counterpart. Besides, the quantitative experimental results verify the feasibility and validity.

The study uses various traffic datasets by the California Department of Transportation, and employs a variety of standard algorithms (LASSO regression, shallow and deep neural networks, stacked autoencoders, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks) for comparison purposes: all algorithms are implemented in MATLAB on the same computing platform. The study demonstrates a BLS training process two-three orders of magnitude faster (tens of seconds against tens-hundreds of thousands of seconds), allowing unprecedented real-time capabilities. Additional comparisons with the extreme learning machine architecture, a learning algorithm sharing some features with BLS, confirm the fast training of least-square training as compared to gradient training.

J	Qi, YH; Hossain, MS; Nie, JT; Li, XD				Qi, Yuanhang; Hossain, M. Shamim; Nie, Jiangtian; Li, Xuandi			Privacy-preserving blockchain-based federated learning for traffic flow prediction	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Federated learning; Blockchain; Local differential privacy; Traffic flow prediction; Intelligent transportation systems	FRAMEWORK; NETWORK	As accurate and timely traffic flow information is extremely important for traffic management, traffic flow prediction has become a vital component of intelligent transportation systems. However, existing traffic flow prediction methods based on centralized machine learning need to gather raw data for model training, which involves serious privacy exposure risks. To address these problems, federated learning that shares model updates without exchanging raw data, has recently been introduced as an efficient solution for achieving privacy protection. However, the existing federated learning frameworks are based on a centralized model coordinator that still suffers from severe security challenges, such as a single point of failure. Thereby, a consortium blockchain-based federated learning framework is proposed to enable decentralized, reliable, and secure federated learning without a centralized model coordinator. In the proposed framework, the model updates from distributed vehicles are verified by miners to prevent unreliable model updates and are then stored on the blockchain. In addition, to further protect model privacy on the blockchain, a differential privacy method with a noise-adding mechanism is applied for the blockchain-based federated learning framework. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed schemes can effectively prevent data poisoning attacks and improve the privacy protection of model updates for secure and privacy-preserving traffic flow prediction.

Artificial intelligence based quality of transmission predictive model for cognitive optical networks	OPTIK			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Optical networks; Quality of Transmission; Predictive model; Machine learning; Transmission equation	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; PERFORMANCE	Due to the advancements in 5 G technologies, high-definition, and the internet of things (IoT), the capacity demand of optical networks has been exponentially increased. Optical communication networks offer several metrics such as high transmission capacity, low transmission loss, better anti-interference, robustness, etc which offers new opportunities to the communication field. To satisfy the increasing demands of optical networks, effective network resource utilization become essential. So, it is needed to design proper planning tools with superior accuracy for quality of transmission (QoT) in optical networks. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques pose new opportunities for resolving these issues and machine learning (ML) algorithms offer better performance over the analytical approaches. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel AI based cognitive QoT prediction (AI-CQoT) model for optical communication networks. The proposed AI-CQoT model aims to predict the QoT for the quality of service (QoS) link setup using AI techniques with the transmission equation based synthetic data generation. The proposed model uses the Label weighting extreme learning machine (LW-ELM) model for the prediction process which includes a link and signal characteristics as input features. Besides, the LW-ELM model is trained by the use of transmission equations. For improving the predictive performance of the LW-ELM model, the parameters such as weight matrix W and penalty factor C are optimally tuned by the use of the shuffled shepherd optimization (SSO) algorithm. A detailed experimental validation is performed to highlight the improved performance of the AI-CQoT model and the results are investigated in terms of different performance measures.

Traffic classification (TC), i.e., the set of procedures for inferring (mobile) applications generating such traffic, has become nowadays the enabler for highly valuable profiling information (with certain privacy downsides), other than being the workhorse for service differentiation/blocking. Nonetheless, the design of accurate classifiers is exacerbated by the raising adoption of encrypted protocols (such as TLS), hindering the suitability of (effective) deep packet inspection approaches. Also, the fast-expanding set of apps and the moving-target nature of mobile traffic makes design solutions with usual machine learning, based on manually and expert-originated features, outdated and unable to keep the pace. For these reasons deep learning (DL) is here proposed, for the first time, as a viable strategy to design practical mobile traffic classifiers based on automatically extracted features, able to cope with encrypted traffic, and reflecting their complex traffic patterns. To this end, different state-of-the-art DL techniques from (standard) TC are here reproduced, dissected (highlighting critical choices), and set into a systematic framework for comparison, including also a performance evaluation workbench. The latter outcome, although declined in the mobile context, has the applicability appeal to the wider umbrella of encrypted TC tasks. Finally, the performance of these DL classifiers is critically investigated based on an exhaustive experimental validation (based on three mobile datasets of real human users' activity), highlighting the related pitfalls, design guidelines, and challenges.

More Than Privacy: Applying Differential Privacy in Key Areas of Artificial Intelligence	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Machine learning; Privacy; Multi-agent systems; Security; Differential privacy; artificial intelligence; machine learning; deep learning; multi-agent systems	SPECTRUM AUCTION; STABILITY; MECHANISM; VALIDITY	Artificial Intelligence (AI) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. However, alongside all its advancements, problems have also emerged, such as privacy violations, security issues and model fairness. Differential privacy, as a promising mathematical model, has several attractive properties that can help solve these problems, making it quite a valuable tool. For this reason, differential privacy has been broadly applied in AI but to date, no study has documented which differential privacy mechanisms can or have been leveraged to overcome its issues or the properties that make this possible. In this paper, we show that differential privacy can do more than just privacy preservation. It can also be used to improve security, stabilize learning, build fair models, and impose composition in selected areas of AI. With a focus on regular machine learning, distributed machine learning, deep learning, and multi-agent systems, the purpose of this article is to deliver a new view on many possibilities for improving AI performance with differential privacy techniques.

Current solutions for anatomy detection are typically based on machine learning techniques that exploit large annotated image databases in order to learn the appearance of the captured anatomy. These solutions are subject to several limitations, including the use of suboptimal feature engineering techniques and most importantly the use of computationally suboptimal search-schemes for anatomy detection. To address these issues, we propose a method that follows a new paradigm by reformulating the detection problem as a behavior learning task for an artificial agent. We couple the modeling of the anatomy appearance and the object search in a unified behavioral framework, using the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning and multi-scale image analysis. In other words, an artificial agent is trained not only to distinguish the target anatomical object from the rest of the body but also how to find the object by learning and following an optimal navigation path to the target object in the imaged volumetric space. We evaluated our approach on 1487 3D-CT volumes from 532 patients, totaling over 500,000 image slices and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on detecting several anatomical structures with no failed cases from a clinical acceptance perspective, while also achieving a 20-30 percent higher detection accuracy. Most importantly, we improve the detection-speed of the reference methods by 2-3 orders of magnitude, achieving unmatched real-time performance on large 3D-CT scans.

The performance of traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods depend on feature extraction of fault signals, which requires signal processing techniques, expert knowledge, and human labor. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied widely in machine health monitoring. With the capacity of automatically learning complex features of input data, deep learning architectures have great potential to overcome drawbacks of traditional intelligent fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a method for diagnosing bearing faults based on a deep structure of convolutional neural network. Using vibration signals directly as input data, the proposed method is an automatic fault diagnosis system which does not require any feature extraction techniques and achieves very high accuracy and robustness under noisy environments.

Many applications on the rise need accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application areas. Firstly, we formulate the semantic segmentation problem and define the terminology of this field as well as interesting background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and goals. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. We also devote a part of the paper to review common loss functions and error metrics for this problem. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In light of the success of deep learning in computer vision, deep-learning-based video prediction emerged as a promising research direction. Defined as a self-supervised learning task, video prediction represents a suitable framework for representation learning, as it demonstrated potential capabilities for extracting meaningful representations of the underlying patterns in natural videos. Motivated by the increasing interest in this task, we provide a review on the deep learning methods for prediction in video sequences. We first define the video prediction fundamentals, as well as mandatory background concepts and the most used datasets. Next, we carefully analyze existing video prediction models organized according to a proposed taxonomy, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. The summary of the datasets and methods is accompanied with experimental results that facilitate the assessment of the state of the art on a quantitative basis. The paper is summarized by drawing some general conclusions, identifying open research challenges and by pointing out future research directions.

As yet, there are no established drugs available. Speeding up drug discovery is urgently required. We applied a workflow of combined in silico methods (virtual drug screening, molecular docking and supervised machine learning algorithms) to identify novel drug candidates against COVID-19. We constructed chemical libraries consisting of FDAapproved drugs for drug repositioning and of natural compound datasets from literature mining and the ZINC database to select compounds interacting with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, and 2 '-o-ribose methyltransferase). Supported by the supercomputer MOGON, candidate compounds were predicted as presumable SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Interestingly, several approved drugs against hepatitis C virus (HCV), another enveloped (-) ssRNA virus (paritaprevir, simeprevir and velpatasvir) as well as drugs against transmissible diseases, against cancer, or other diseases were identified as candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This result is supported by reports that anti-HCV compounds are also active against Middle East Respiratory Virus Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. The candidate compounds identified by us may help to speed up the drug development against SARS-CoV-2.

Significant progress has been made on designing discriminative features to bridge the affective gap. Assuming that viewers can reach a consensus on the emotion of images, most existing works focused on assigning the dominant emotion category or the average dimension values to an image. However, the image emotions perceived by viewers are subjective by nature with the influence of personal and situational factors. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach that characterizes the categorical image emotions as a discrete probability distribution (DPD). To associate emotion with the visual features extracted from images, we present shared sparse learning to learn the combination coefficients, with which the DPD of an unseen image is predicted by linearly combining the DPDs of the training images. Furthermore, we extend our method to the setup where multi-features are available and learn the optimal weights for each feature to reflect the importance of different features. Extensive experiments are carried out on Abstract, Emotion6 and IESN datasets and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

In contrast, humans have the ability to discriminate even similar objects with little supervision. This article attempts to address the few-shot fine-grained image classification problem. We propose a feature fusion model to explore discriminative features by focusing on key regions. The model utilizes the focus-area location mechanism to discover the perceptually similar regions among objects. High-order integration is employed to capture the interaction information among intraparts. We also design a center neighbor loss to form robust embedding space distributions. Furthermore, we build a typical fine-grained and few-shot learning dataset miniPPlankton from the real-world application in the area of marine ecological environments. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the performance of our method. The results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art models. Our work is a valuable complement to the model domain-specific industrial applications.

Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Tertiary, urban, academic medical center from November 2008 to January 2016. Patients: All adult inpatients without pre-existing renal failure at admission, defined as first serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition, code for chronic kidney disease stage 4 or higher or having received renal replacement therapy within 48 hours of first serum creatinine measurement. Interventions: None. Measurements and MainResults: Demographics, vital signs, diagnostics, and interventions were used in a Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm to predict serum creatinine-based Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stage 2 acute kidney injury, with 60% of the data used for derivation and 40% for validation. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated in the validation cohort, and subgroup analyses were conducted across admission serum creatinine, acute kidney injury severity, and hospital location. Among the 121,158 included patients, 17,482 (14.4%) developed any Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes acute kidney injury, with 4,251 (3.5%) developing stage 2. The AUC (95% CI) was 0.90 (0.90-0.90) for predicting stage 2 acute kidney injury within 24 hours and 0.87 (0.87-0.87) within 48 hours. The AUC was 0.96 (0.96-0.96) for receipt of renal replacement therapy (n = 821) in the next 48 hours. Accuracy was similar across hospital settings (ICU, wards, and emergency department) and admitting serum creatinine groupings. At a probability threshold of greater than or equal to 0.022, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 85% for stage 2 acute kidney injury and predicted the development of stage 2 a median of 41 hours (interquartile range, 12-141 hr) prior to the development of stage 2 acute kidney injury. Conclusions: Readily available electronic health record data can be used to predict impending acute kidney injury prior to changes in serum creatinine with excellent accuracy across different patient locations and admission serum creatinine. Real-time use of this model would allow early interventions for those at high risk of acute kidney injury.

The industrial power load forecasting is deeply studied by fusing some machine-learning methods for industrial enterprise power consumers. As a result, a novel power load forecasting method is proposed by taking into account the variation of load characteristics in different regions, industries, and production patterns. First, through the improved K-means clustering analysis, the historical load data are classified as the production patterns to which they belong. Then, the prediction algorithm combining reinforcement learning with particle swarm optimization and the least-squares support vector machine is proposed. Finally, the improved algorithm in this article is used for short-term load forecasting separately by the load data in different patterns after the above processing. The forecasting method in this article is based on data driven with real datasets. The results of the simulation experiment show that the improved prediction algorithm can distinguish the changes in different production patterns and identify the load characteristics of different regions and industries with high prediction accuracy, which has practical application value.

DL algorithms are characterized with powerful feature learning and expression capabilities compared with the traditional machine learning (ML) methods, which attracts worldwide researchers from different fields to its increasingly wide applications. Furthermore, in the field of geochnical engineering, DL has been widely adopted in various research topics, a comprehensive review summarizing its application is desirable. Consequently, this study presented the state of practice of DL in geotechnical engineering, and depicted the statistical trend of the published papers. Four major algorithms, including feedforward neural (FNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN) along with their geotechnical applications were elaborated.

J	Chen, ZH; Jiang, CY; Xie, LH				Chen, Zhenghua; Jiang, Chaoyang; Xie, Lihua			A Novel Ensemble ELM for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Sensors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Ensemble Extreme learning machine (ELM); feature engineering; Gaussian random projection (GRP); human activity recognition; smartphone sensors	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; OCCUPANCY ESTIMATION; ACTIVITY CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM	Human activity recognition plays a unique role in many important applications, including ubiquitous computing, health-care services, and smart buildings. Due to the nonintrusive property of smartphones, smartphone sensors are widely used for the identification of human activities. Since the signals of smartphone sensors are quite noisy, feature engineering will be performed to extract more discriminant representations. Then, various machine learning algorithms can be employed to recognize different human activities. Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been shown to be effective in classification tasks with extremely fast learning speed. Due to its randomness property, it is naturally suitable for ensemble learning. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble ELM algorithm for human activity recognition using smartphone sensors. Gaussian random projection is employed to initialize the input weights of base ELMs. By doing this, more diversities can be generated to boost the performance of ensemble learning. Real experimental data has been applied to evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. We also conduct a comparison of the proposed approach with some stateof- the-art approaches in the literature. The experimental results indicate that our proposed ensemble ELM approach outperforms these approaches and can achieve recognition accuracies of 97.35% and 98.88% on two datasets.

In an SHIM system, there are plenty of sensors to acquire a huge number of monitoring data, which can factually reflect the in-service condition of the target structure. In order to bridge the gap between SHIM and structural maintenance and management (SMM), it is necessary to employ advanced data processing methods to convert the original multi-source heterogeneous field monitoring data into different types of specific physical indicators in order to make effective decisions regarding inspection, maintenance and management. Conventional approaches to data analysis are confronted with challenges from environmental noise, the volume of measurement data, the complexity of computation, etc., and they severely constrain the pervasive application of SHIM technology. In recent years, with the rapid progress of computing hardware and image acquisition equipment, the deep learning-based data processing approach offers a new channel for excavating the massive data from an SHIM system, towards autonomous, accurate and robust processing of the monitoring data. Many researchers from the SHM community have made efforts to explore the applications of deep learning-based approaches for structural damage detection and structural condition assessment. This paper gives a review on the deep learning-based SHM of civil infrastructures with the main content, including a brief summary of the history of the development of deep learning, the applications of deep learning-based data processing approaches in the SHIM of many kinds of civil infrastructures, and the key challenges and future trends of the strategy of deep learning-based SHM.

J	Wen, L; Gao, L; Li, XY				Wen, Long; Gao, Liang; Li, Xinyu			A New Deep Transfer Learning Based on Sparse Auto-Encoder for Fault Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deep learning (DL); fault diagnosis; sparse auto-encoder (SAE); transfer learning	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SIGNAL; MODEL	Fault diagnosis plays an important role in modern industry. With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes hot. However, traditional methods have two shortcomings: 1) their performances depend on the good design of handcrafted features of data, but it is difficult to predesign these features and 2) they work well under a general assumption: the training data and testing data should be drawn from the same distribution, but this assumption fails in many engineering applications. Since deep learning (DL) can extract the hierarchical representation features of raw data, and transfer learning provides a good way to perform a learning task on the different but related distribution datasets, deep transfer learning (DTL) has been developed for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a new DTL method is proposed. It uses a three-layer sparse auto-encoder to extract the features of raw data, and applies the maximum mean discrepancy term to minimizing the discrepancy penalty between the features from training data and testing data. The proposed DTL is tested on the famous motor bearing dataset from the Case Western Reserve University. The results show a good improvement, and DTL achieves higher prediction accuracies on most experiments than DL. The prediction accuracy of DTL, which is as high as 99.82%, is better than the results of other algorithms, including deep belief network, sparse filter, artificial neural network, support vector machine and some other traditional methods. What is more, two additional analytical experiments are conducted. The results show that a good unlabeled third dataset may be helpful to DTL, and a good linear relationship between the final prediction accuracies and their standard deviations have been observed.

With an increasing amount of "big data" from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed. Finally, challenges and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed.

Many exhibit both spatial and temporal characteristics, at varying scales, under varying conditions brought on by external sources such as social events, holidays, and the weather. Yet, modeling the interplay of factors, devising generalized representations, and subsequently using them to solve a particular problem can be a challenging task. These situations represent only a fraction of the difficulties faced by modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we present a survey that highlights the role modeling techniques within the realm of deep learning have played within ITS. We focus on how practitioners have formulated problems to address these various challenges, and outline both architectural and problem-specific considerations used to develop solutions. We hope this survey can help to serve as a bridge between the machine learning and transportation communities, shedding light on new domains and considerations in the future.

We consider a bandwidth-limited fading multiple access channel (MAC) from the wireless devices to the PS, and propose various techniques to implement distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) over this shared noisy wireless channel. We first propose a digital DSGD (D-DSGD) scheme, in which one device is selected opportunistically for transmission at each iteration based on the channel conditions; the scheduled device quantizes its gradient estimate to a finite number of bits imposed by the channel condition, and transmits these bits to the PS in a reliable manner. Next, motivated by the additive nature of the wireless MAC, we propose a novel analog communication scheme, referred to as the compressed analog DSGD (CA-DSGD), where the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates while accumulating error from previous iterations, and project the resultant sparse vector into a low-dimensional vector for bandwidth reduction. We also design a power allocation scheme to align the received gradient vectors at the PS in an efficient manner. Numerical results show that D-DSGD outperforms other digital approaches in the literature; however, in general the proposed CA-DSGD algorithm converges faster than the D-DSGD scheme, and reaches a higher level of accuracy. We have observed that the gap between the analog and digital schemes increases when the datasets of devices are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Furthermore, the performance of the CA-DSGD scheme is shown to be robust against imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Overall these results show clear advantages for the proposed analog over-the-air DSGD scheme, which suggests that learning and communication algorithms should be designed jointly to achieve the best end-to-end performance in machine learning applications at the wireless edge.

Assessing the impact of clean air action on air quality trends in Beijing using a machine learning technique	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							METEOROLOGICAL NORMALIZATION; POLLUTION SOURCES; SEVERE HAZE; CHINA; EMISSIONS; PM2.5; MODEL; TIME; OZONE; ACCOUNTABILITY	A 5-year Clean Air Action Plan was implemented in 2013 to reduce air pollutant emissions and improve ambient air quality in Beijing. Assessment of this action plan is an essential part of the decision-making process to review its efficacy and to develop new policies. Both statistical and chemical transport modelling have been previously applied to assess the efficacy of this action plan. However, inherent uncertainties in these methods mean that new and independent methods are required to support the assessment process. Here, we applied a machine-learning-based random forest technique to quantify the effectiveness of Beijing's action plan by decoupling the impact of meteorology on ambient air quality. Our results demonstrate that meteorological conditions have an important impact on the year-to-year variations in ambient air quality. Further analyses show that the PM2.5 mass concentration would have broken the target of the plan (2017 annual PM2.5 < 60 mu gm(-3)) were it not for the meteorological conditions in winter 2017 favouring the dispersion of air pollutants. However, over the whole period (2013-2017), the primary emission controls required by the action plan have led to significant reductions in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO from 2013 to 2017 of approximately 34 %, 24 %, 17 %, 68 %, and 33 %, respectively, after meteorological correction. The marked decrease in PM2.5 and SO2 is largely attributable to a reduction in coal combustion.

J	Fekri, MN; Patel, H; Grolinger, K; Sharma, V				Fekri, Mohammad Navid; Patel, Harsh; Grolinger, Katarina; Sharma, Vinay			Deep learning for load forecasting with smart meter data: Online Adaptive Recurrent Neural Network	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Online learning; Recurrent Neural Network; Bayesian optimization; Adaptive learning; Concept drift; Online Adaptive RNN	WIND	Electricity load forecasting has been attracting research and industry attention because of its importance for energy management, infrastructure planning, and budgeting. In recent years, the proliferation of smart meters and other sensors has created new opportunities for sensor-based load forecasting on the building and even individual household level. Machine learning approaches such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown great successes in load forecasting, but these approaches employ offline learning: they are trained once and miss on the opportunity to learn from newly arriving data. Moreover, they are not well suited for handling the concept drift; for example, their predictive performance will degrade if the load changes due to the installation of new equipment. Consequently, this paper proposes Online Adaptive RNN, an approach for load forecasting capable of continuously learning from newly arriving data and adapting to new patterns. RNN is employed to capture time dependencies while the online aspect is achieved by updating the RNN weights according to new data. The performance is monitored; if it degrades, online tuning is activated to adapt the RNN hyperparameters to changes in data. The proposed approach was evaluated with data from five individual homes: the results show that the proposed approach achieves higher accuracy than the standalone offline long short term memory network and five other online algorithms. Moreover, the time to learn from new samples is only a fraction of the time needed to re-train the offline model.

However, the human factor may cause erroneous diagnosis in the analysis of the EEG signal. In the past 2 decades, many advanced signal processing and machine learning methods have been developed for the detection of epileptic seizures. However, many of these methods require large data sets and complex operations. Methods: In this study, an end-to-end machine learning model is presented for detection of epileptic seizure using the pretrained deep two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and the concept of transfer learning. The EEG signal is converted directly into visual data with a spectrogram and used directly as input data. Results: The authors analyzed the results of the training of the proposed pretrained AlexNet CNN model. Both binary and ternary classifications were performed without any extra procedure such as feature extraction. By performing data set creation from short-term spectrogram graphic images, the authors were able to achieve 100% accuracy for binary classification for epileptic seizure detection and 100% for ternary classification. Discussion/Conclusion: The proposed automatic identification and classification model can help in the early diagnosis of epilepsy, thus providing the opportunity for effective early treatment.

However, the successful application of these methods in motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in order to boost classification performance, is still limited. In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI data by introducing a new temporal representation of the data and also utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for classification. The new representation is generated from modifying the filter-bank common spatial patterns method, and the CNN is designed and optimized accordingly for the representation. Our framework outperforms the best classification method in the literature on the BCI competition IV-2a 4-class MI data set by 7% increase in average subject accuracy. Furthermore, by studying the convolutional weights of the trained networks, we gain an insight into the temporal characteristics of EEG.

Feature selection of model factors is an effective method for improving the accuracy of AGB estimates. Machine learning algorithms are also widely used in AGB estimation, although little research has addressed the use of the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) for AGB estimation. Both feature selection and regression for AGB estimation models are typically performed with the same machine learning algorithm, but there is no evidence to suggest that this is the best method. Therefore, the present study focuses on evaluating the performance of the CatBoost algorithm for AGB estimation and comparing the performance of different combinations of feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms. AGB estimation models of four forest types were developed based on Landsat OLI data using three feature selection methods (recursive feature elimination (RFE), variable selection using random forests (VSURF), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)) and three machine learning algorithms (random forest regression (RFR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and categorical boosting (CatBoost)). Feature selection had a significant influence on AGB estimation. RFE preserved the most informative features for AGB estimation and was superior to VSURF and LASSO. In addition, CatBoost improved the accuracy of the AGB estimation models compared with RFR and XGBoost. AGB estimation models using RFE for feature selection and CatBoost as the regression algorithm achieved the highest accuracy, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 26.54 Mg/ha for coniferous forest, 24.67 Mg/ha for broad-leaved forest, 22.62 Mg/ha for mixed forests, and 25.77 Mg/ha for all forests. The combination of RFE and CatBoost had better performance than the VSURF-RFR combination in which random forests were used for both feature selection and regression, indicating that feature selection and regression performed by a single machine learning algorithm may not always ensure optimal AGB estimation. It is promising to extending the application of new machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods to improve the accuracy of AGB estimates.

From Machine to Machine An OCT-Trained Deep Learning Algorithm for Objective Quantification of Glaucomatous Damage in Fundus Photographs	OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA; DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; SCANNING PROTOCOLS; AGREEMENT; RACE; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; IMAGES; DISK	Purpose: Previous approaches using deep learning (DL) algorithms to classify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs have been limited by the requirement for human labeling of a reference training set. We propose a new approach using quantitative spectral-domain (SD) OCT data to train a DL algorithm to quantify glaucomatous structural damage on optic disc photographs. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 32 820 pairs of optic disc photographs and SD OCT retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scans from 2312 eyes of 1198 participants. Methods: The sample was divided randomly into validation plus training (80%) and test (20%) sets, with randomization performed at the patient level. A DL convolutional neural network was trained to assess optic disc photographs and predict SD OCT average RNFL thickness. Main Outcome Measures: The DL algorithm performance was evaluated in the test sample by evaluating correlation and agreement between the predictions and actual SD OCT measurements. We also assessed the ability to discriminate eyes with glaucomatous visual field loss from healthy eyes with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The mean prediction of average RNFL thickness from all 6292 optic disc photographs in the test set was 83.3 +/- 14.5 mm, whereas the mean average RNFL thickness from all corresponding SD OCT scans was 82.5 +/- 16.8 mm (P = 0.164). There was a very strong correlation between predicted and observed RNFL thickness values (Pearson r = 0.832; R-2 = 69.3%; P < 0.001), with mean absolute error of the predictions of 7.39 mm. The area under the ROC curves for discriminating glaucomatous from healthy eyes with the DL predictions and actual SD OCT average RNFL thickness measurements were 0.944 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.912-0.966) and 0.940 (95% CI, 0.902-0.966), respectively (P = 0.724). Conclusions: We introduced a novel DL approach to assess fundus photographs and provide quantitative information about the amount of neural damage that can be used to diagnose and stage glaucoma. In addition, training neural networks to predict SD OCT data objectively represents a new approach that overcomes limitations of human labeling and could be useful in other areas of ophthalmology.

However, withstanding cyber threats to such large-scale, complex, and heterogeneous industrial CPSs has been extremely challenging, due to the insufficiency of high-quality attack examples. In this article, we propose a novel federated deep learning scheme, named DeepFed, to detect cyber threats against industrial CPSs. Specifically, we first design a new deep learning-based intrusion detection model for industrial CPSs, by making use of a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent unit. Second, we develop a federated learning framework, allowing multiple industrial CPSs to collectively build a comprehensive intrusion detection model in a privacy-preserving way. Further, a Paillier cryptosystem-based secure communication protocol is crafted to preserve the security and privacy of model parameters through the training process. Extensive experiments on a real industrial CPS dataset demonstrate the high effectiveness of the proposed DeepFed scheme in detecting various types of cyber threats to industrial CPSs and the superiorities over state-of-the-art schemes.

J	Alqudah, A; Alqudah, AM				Alqudah, Amin; Alqudah, Ali Mohammad			Sliding Window Based Support Vector Machine System for Classification of Breast Cancer Using Histopathological Microscopic Images	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article						Breast cancer; Histopathological images; Local binary pattern; Sliding window features; Support vector machine	ENTROPY	Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women's community, which is responsible for millions of death cases. The early diagnosis of breast cancer in its early stages increases the chances of healing; the most common current diagnosis methods are based on digital mammogram images and histopathological images. Automatic diagnosis of breast cancer and classifying the type of cancer is recommended to decrease the error that can be caused by humans. Recently, many systems have been developed to diagnose breast cancer by extracting textural and non-textural features from digital mammograms or histopathological images. This paper proposes a new sliding window technique for feature extraction where the local binary pattern (LBP) features are used. In this technique, each image produces 25 sliding windows. Features extracted from each window are saved and used to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM classifier is used to classify each image into benign and malignant based on its most common windows classes. The system can be used to localize the cancerous tissues from the whole histopathological image. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 91.12%, sensitivity of 85.22%, and specificity of 94.01%. Which is considered high when compared with other systems in the literature. The system can extend to extract more features and a comparison between different machine learning algorithms can performed.

Firstly, a geospatial database for the study area was prepared, which includes 391 historical landslides and 16 landslide-affecting factors. Then, the sensitivity of different combinations of these factors for modeling was validated using the forward elimination technique. The MBSVM landslide model was built using the datasets generated from the best selected factors and validated utilizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), statistical indexes, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results show that this novel hybrid model has good performance both in terms of goodness of fit with the training dataset (AUC=0.972) and the capability to predict landslides with the testing dataset (AUC=0.966). The efficiency of the proposed model was then validated by comparison with logistic regression (LR), a single SVM, and another hybrid model of the AdaBoost ensemble and an SVM (ABSVM). Comparison results show that the MBSVM outperforms the LR, single SVM, and hybrid ABSVM models. Thus, the proposed model is a promising and good alternative tool for landslide hazard assessment in landslide-prone areas.

J	Tabernik, D; Sela, S; Skvarc, J; Skocaj, D				Tabernik, Domen; Sela, Samo; Skvarc, Jure; Skocaj, Danijel			Segmentation-based deep-learning approach for surface-defect detection	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Surface-defect detection; Visual inspection; Quality control; Deep learning; Computer vision; Segmentation networks; Industry 4; 0		Automated surface-anomaly detection using machine learning has become an interesting and promising area of research, with a very high and direct impact on the application domain of visual inspection. Deep-learning methods have become the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection system to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of exemplar images. This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection. The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small number of samples, which is an important requirement for practical applications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the related methods on the specific domain of surface-crack detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the required precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples and on the required computational cost. Experiments are performed on a newly created dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected surfaces, using only approximately 25-30 defective training samples, instead of hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications. This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the number of available defective samples is limited. The dataset is also made publicly available to encourage the development and evaluation of new methods for surface-defect detection.

In this study, a novel wind speed multistep prediction model is proposed by combing the VMD (Variational Mode Decomposition), SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network and ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), in which, the VMD is employed to decompose the original wind speed data into a series of sub-layers; the SSA is adopted to further extract the trend information of all the sub layers; the LSTM network is used to complete the forecasting for the low-frequency sub-layers obtained by the VMD-SSA; and the ELM is used to complete the forecasting for the high-frequency sub-layers obtained by the VMD-SSA. To investigate the multistep prediction performance of the proposed models, eight models are included in the comparisons. The four experiments results show that: (a) among all the involved models, the proposed model has the best multistep prediction performance; (b) compared to the other involved models, the proposed model is more effective and robust in extracting the trend information.

To facilitate a comprehensive review, key concepts and typical architectures are firstly summarized in a unified framework. Accordingly, popular/benchmark datasets for marine object recognition are thoroughly collected and deep learning methodologies are comprehensively analyzed with intensive comparisons. Moreover, experimental results and futuristic trends in marine object recognition are intensively discussed.

F.; van der Schaar, Mihaela			Cardiovascular disease risk prediction using automated machine learning: A prospective study of 423,604 UK Biobank participants	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE; HEART-ASSOCIATION; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; 10-YEAR RISK; FOLLOW-UP; PREVENTION; FRAMINGHAM; CARDIOLOGY; GUIDELINE; EQUATIONS	Background Identifying people at risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is a cornerstone of preventative cardiology. Risk prediction models currently recommended by clinical guidelines are typically based on a limited number of predictors with sub-optimal performance across all patient groups. Data-driven techniques based on machine learning (ML) might improve the performance of risk predictions by agnostically discovering novel risk predictors and learning the complex interactions between them. We tested (1) whether ML techniques based on a state-of-the-art automated ML framework (AutoPrognosis) could improve CVD risk prediction compared to traditional approaches, and (2) whether considering non-traditional variables could increase the accuracy of CVD risk predictions. Methods and findings Using data on 423,604 participants without CVD at baseline in UK Biobank, we developed a ML-based model for predicting CVD risk based on 473 available variables. Our ML-based model was derived using AutoPrognosis, an algorithmic tool that automatically selects and tunes ensembles of ML modeling pipelines (comprising data imputation, feature processing, classification and calibration algorithms). We compared our model with a well-established risk prediction algorithm based on conventional CVD risk factors (Framingham score), a Cox proportional hazards (PH) model based on familiar risk factors (i.e, age, gender, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, history of diabetes, reception of treatments for hypertension and body mass index), and a Cox PH model based on all of the 473 available variables. Predictive performances were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Overall, our AutoPrognosis model improved risk prediction (AUC-ROC: 0.774, 95% CI: 0.768-0.780) compared to Framingham score (AUC-ROC: 0.724, 95% CI: 0.720-0.728, p < 0.001), Cox PH model with conventional risk factors (AUC-ROC: 0.734, 95% CI: 0.729-0.739, p < 0.001), and Cox PH model with all UK Biobank variables (AUC-ROC: 0.758, 95% CI: 0.753-0.763, p < 0.001). Out of 4,801 CVD cases recorded within 5 years of baseline, AutoPrognosis was able to correctly predict 368 more cases compared to the Framingham score. Our AutoPrognosis model included predictors that are not usually considered in existing risk prediction models, such as the individuals' usual walking pace and their self-reported overall health rating. Furthermore, our model improved risk prediction in potentially relevant sub-populations, such as in individuals with history of diabetes. We also highlight the relative benefits accrued from including more information into a predictive model (information gain) as compared to the benefits of using more complex models (modeling gain). Conclusions Our AutoPrognosis model improves the accuracy of CVD risk prediction in the UK Biobank population. This approach performs well in traditionally poorly served patient subgroups. Additionally, AutoPrognosis uncovered novel predictors for CVD disease that may now be tested in prospective studies. We found that the "information gain" achieved by considering more risk factors in the predictive model was significantly higher than the "modeling gain" achieved by adopting complex predictive models.

This study compares the performance of two popular machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), to detect the occurrence of accidents on the Eisenhower expressway in Chicago. Accordingly, since the detection of accidents should be as rapid as possible, seven models are trained and tested for each machine learning technique, using traffic condition data from 1 to 7 min after the actual occurrence. The main sources of data used in this study consist of weather condition, accident, and loop detector data. Furthermore, to overcome the problem of imbalanced data (i.e., underrepresentation of accidents in the dataset), the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is used. The results show that although SVM achieves overall higher accuracy, PNN outperforms SVM regarding the Detection Rate (DR) (i.e., percentage of correct accident detections). In addition, while both models perform best at 5 min after the occurrence of accidents, models trained at 3 or 4 min after the occurrence of an accident detect accidents more rapidly while performing reasonably well. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis of PNN for Time-To-Detection (TM) reveals that the speed difference between upstream and downstream of accidents location is particularly significant to detect the occurrence of accidents.

Several pattern recognition tools have been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of available trial data. The most widely used methods are principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), soft independent modelling by class analogy (SIMCA), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). Nevertheless, there are alternative data treatment methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF), that show a great potential and more advantages compared to conventional ones. In this paper, we explain the background of these methods and review and discuss the reported studies in which these three methods have been applied in the area of food quality and authenticity. In addition, we clarify the technical terminology used in this particular area of research.

Artificial intelligence as the next step towards precision pathology	JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Review						artificial intelligence; deep learning; digital image analysis; digital pathology; machine learning; pathology	DIGITAL-IMAGE-ANALYSIS; TUMOR-INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES; EARLY BREAST-CANCER; BIOMARKER ASSESSMENT; STANDARDIZED METHOD; INTERNATIONAL KI67; ACTIVE CONTOUR; SOLID TUMORS; KI-67 SCORE; VALIDATION	Pathology is the cornerstone of cancer care. The need for accuracy in histopathologic diagnosis of cancer is increasing as personalized cancer therapy requires accurate biomarker assessment. The appearance of digital image analysis holds promise to improve both the volume and precision of histomorphological evaluation. Recently, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has enabled rapid advances in computational pathology. The integration of machine learning into routine care will be a milestone for the healthcare sector in the next decade, and histopathology is right at the centre of this revolution. Examples of potential high-value machine learning applications include both model-based assessment of routine diagnostic features in pathology, and the ability to extract and identify novel features that provide insights into a disease. Recent groundbreaking results have demonstrated that applications of machine learning methods in pathology significantly improves metastases detection in lymph nodes, Ki67 scoring in breast cancer, Gleason grading in prostate cancer and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scoring in melanoma. Furthermore, deep learning models have also been demonstrated to be able to predict status of some molecular markers in lung, prostate, gastric and colorectal cancer based on standard HE slides. Moreover, prognostic (survival outcomes) deep neural network models based on digitized HE slides have been demonstrated in several diseases, including lung cancer, melanoma and glioma. In this review, we aim to present and summarize the latest developments in digital image analysis and in the application of artificial intelligence in diagnostic pathology.

Brain tumor classification using deep CNN features via transfer learning	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain tumor; Computer-aided diagnosis; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural network; Support vector machine	MR-IMAGES; NETWORKS	Brain tumor classification is an important problem in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for medical applications. This paper focuses on a 3-class classification problem to differentiate among glioma, meningioma and pituitary tumors, which form three prominent types of brain tumor. The proposed classification system adopts the concept of deep transfer learning and uses a pre-trained GoogLeNet to extract features from brain MRI images. Proven classifier models are integrated to classify the extracted features. The experiment follows a patient-level five-fold cross-validation process, on MRI dataset from figshare. The proposed system records a mean classification accuracy of 98%, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. Other performance measures used in the study are the area under the curve (AUC), precision, recall, F-score and specificity. In addition, the paper addresses a practical aspect by evaluating the system with fewer training samples. The observations of the study imply that transfer learning is a useful technique when the availability of medical images is limited. The paper provides an analytical discussion on misclassifications also.	[Deepak, S.; Ameer, P.

Traditionally, speech separation is studied as a signal processing problem. A more recent approach formulates speech separation as a supervised learning problem, where the discriminative patterns of speech, speakers, and background noise are learned from training data. Over the past decade, many supervised separation algorithms have been put forward. In particular, the recent introduction of deep learning to supervised speech separation has dramatically accelerated progress and boosted separation performance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research on deep learning based supervised speech separation in the last several years. We first introduce the background of speech separation and the formulation of supervised separation. Then, we discuss three main components of supervised separation: learning machines, training targets, and acoustic features. Much of the overview is on separation algorithms where we review monaural methods, including speech enhancement (speech-nonspeech separation), speaker separation (multitalker separation), and speech derev erberation, as well as multimicrophone techniques. The important issue of generalization, unique to supervised learning, is discussed. This overview provides a historical perspective on how advances are made. In addition, we discuss a number of conceptual issues, including what constitutes the target source.

Deep learning models for plant disease detection and diagnosis	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Convolutional neural networks; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Plant disease identification; Pattern recognition		In this paper, convolutional neural network models were developed to perform plant disease detection and diagnosis using simple leaves images of healthy and diseased plants, through deep learning methodologies. Training of the models was performed with the use of an open database of 87,848 images, containing 25 different plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, including healthy plants. Several model architectures were trained, with the best performance reaching a 99.53% success rate in identifying the corresponding [plant, disease] combination (or healthy plant). The significantly high success rate makes the model a very useful advisory or early warning tool, and an approach that could be further expanded to support an integrated plant disease identification system to operate in real cultivation conditions.

Such data islands situation and data privacy & security are two major challenges for applications of artificial intelligence. In this article, we tackle these challenges and propose a privacy-preserving machine learning model, called Federated Forest, which is a lossless learning model of the traditional random forest method, i.e., achieving the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving approach. Based on it, we developed a secure cross-regional machine learning system that allows a learning process to be jointly trained over different regions' clients with the same user samples but different attribute sets, processing the data stored in each of them without exchanging their raw data. A novel prediction algorithm was also proposed which could largely reduce the communication overhead. Experiments on both real-world and UCI data sets demonstrate the performance of the Federated Forest is as accurate as of the non-federated version. The efficiency and robustness of our proposed system had been verified. Overall, our model is practical, scalable and extensible for real-life tasks.

This interface enables sensory information to be organized identified, and interpreted through perceptual learningthe process whereby the sensing abilities improve through experience. Here, an artificial sensory neuron that can integrate and differentiate the spatiotemporal features of touched patterns for recognition is shown. The system comprises sensing, transmitting, and processing components that are parallel to those found in a sensory neuron. A resistive pressure sensor converts pressure stimuli into electric signals, which are transmitted to a synaptic transistor through interfacial ionic/electronic coupling via a soft ionic conductor. Furthermore, the recognition error rate can be dramatically decreased from 44% to 0.4% by integrating with the machine learning method. This work represents a step toward the design and use of neuromorphic electronic skin with artificial intelligence for robotics and prosthetics.

Machine learning(ML) algorithms can be trained on high-throughput screening data to develop models that are able to predict the response of cancer cell lines and patients to novel drugs or drug combinations. Deep learning (DL) refers to a distinct class of ML algorithms that have achieved top-level performance in a variety of fields, including drug discovery. These types of models have unique characteristics that may make them more suitable for the complex task of modeling drug response based on both biological and chemical data, but the application of DL to drug response prediction has been unexplored until very recently. The few studies that have been published have shown promising results, and the use of DL for drug response prediction is beginning to attract greater interest from researchers in the field. In this article, we critically review recently published studies that have employed DL methods to predict drug response in cancer cell lines.We also provide a brief description of DL and the main types of architectures that have been used in these studies. Additionally, we present a selection of publicly available drug screening data resources that can be used to develop drug response prediction models. Finally, we also address the limitations of these approaches and provide a discussion on possible paths for further improvement.

When the imbalance ratio (IR) of data is high, most existing imbalanced learning methods decline seriously in classification performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate the highly imbalanced data classification problem, and propose an uncorrelated cost-sensitive multiset learning (UCML) approach for it. Specifically, UCML first constructs multiple balanced subsets through random partition, and then employs the multiset feature learning (MFL) to learn discriminant features from the constructed multiset. To enhance the usability of each subset and deal with the nonlinearity issue existed in each subset, we further propose a deep metric based UCML (DM-UCML) approach. DM-UCML introduces the generative adversarial network technique into the multiset constructing process, such that each subset can own similar distribution with the original dataset. To cope with the non-linearity issue, DM-UCML integrates deep metric learning with MFL, such that more favorable performance can be achieved. In addition, DM-UCML designs a new discriminant term to enhance the discriminability of learned metrics. Experiments on eight traditional highly class-imbalanced datasets and two large-scale datasets indicate that: the proposed approaches outperform state-of-the-art highly imbalanced learning methods and are more robust to high IR.

The sample data after dimension reduction are obtained by layer by layer pretraining and fine-tuning. The traditional deep learning algorithms [stacked noise autoencoder (SNAE), stacked autoencoder (SAE), stacked contractive autoencoder (SCAE), stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE), deep belief network (DBN)] are introduced to carry out the comparative simulation with the model in this study. The results show that when the encoder in the model is a 4-layer network structure, the accuracy rate (Ac) of the model is the highest (97.83%), the false-negative rate (Fn) (1.27%) and the false-positive rate (Fp) (3.21%) are the lowest. When the number of nodes in the first hidden layer is about 110, the model accuracy is about 98%. When comparing the model designed in this study with the common feature dimension reduction methods, the Ac, Fn, and Fp of this model are the best, which are 98.12%, 3.21%, and 1.27%, respectively. When compared with other deep learning algorithms of the same type, the recognition rate, Ac, error rate, and rejection rate show good results. In multiple data sets, the recognition rate, Ac, error rate, and rejection rate of the model in this study are always better than the traditional deep learning algorithms. In conclusion, when deep learning SDAE is applied to IoT convergence-based intrusion security detection, the detection load can be reduced, the detection effect can be improved, and the operation is more secure and stable.

So, the current research intend to present the first comprehensive comparison among the performances of ten advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs) including artificial neural networks (ANNs), boosted regression tree (BRT), classification and regression trees (CART), generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), nave Bayes (NB), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM) for modeling landslide susceptibility and evaluating the importance of variables in GIS and R open source software. This study was carried out in the Ghaemshahr Region, Iran. The performance of MLTs has been evaluated using the area under ROC curve (AUC-ROC) approach. The results showed that AUC values for ten MLTs vary from 62.4 to 83.7%. It has been found that the RF (AUC = 83.7%) and BRT (AUC = 80.7%) have the best performances comparison to other MLTs.

Approval of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based medical devices in the USA and Europe (2015-20): a comparative analysis	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article								There has been a surge of interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based medical devices. However, it is poorly understood how and which AI/ML-based medical devices have been approved in the USA and Europe. We searched governmental and non-governmental databases to identify 222 devices approved in the USA and 240 devices in Europe. The number of approved AI/ML-based devices has increased substantially since 2015, with many being approved for use in radiology. However, few were qualified as high-risk devices. Of the 124 AI/ML-based devices commonly approved in the USA and Europe, 80 were first approved in Europe. One possible reason for approval in Europe before the USA might be the potentially relatively less rigorous evaluation of medical devices in Europe. The substantial number of approved devices highlight the need to ensure rigorous regulation of these devices. Currently, there is no specific regulatory pathway for AI/ML-based medical devices in the USA or Europe. We recommend more transparency on how devices are regulated and approved to enable and improve public trust, efficacy, safety, and quality of AI/ML-based medical devices. A comprehensive, publicly accessible database with device details for Conformite Europeene (CE)-marked medical devices in Europe and US Food and Drug Administration approved devices is needed.

Accurate and robust short-term wind speed forecasting is crucial for large-scale integration of wind power generation into the power grid. However, the seasonal and stochastic characteristics of wind speed make forecasting a challenging task. This study adopts a novel hybrid deep learning-based evolutionary approach in an attempt to improve the accuracy of wind speed prediction. This hybrid model consists of a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network, an effective hierarchical evolutionary decomposition technique and an improved generalised normal distribution optimisation algorithm for hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed hybrid approach was trained and tested on data gathered from an offshore wind turbine installed in a Swedish wind farm located in the Baltic Sea with two forecasting horizons: ten-minutes ahead and one-hour ahead. The experimental results indicated that the new approach is superior to six other applied machine learning models and a further seven hybrid models, as measured by seven performance criteria.

Deep learning: new computational modelling techniques for genomics	NATURE REVIEWS GENETICS			English	Review							NEURAL-NETWORKS; CHIP-SEQ; DNA; GENE; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; CANCER; SITES	As a data-driven science, genomics largely utilizes machine learning to capture dependencies in data and derive novel biological hypotheses. However, the ability to extract new insights from the exponentially increasing volume of genomics data requires more expressive machine learning models.

This paper proposes an end-to-end multi-task learning temporal convolutional neural network (MTL-TCNN) to predict the short-term passenger demand in a multi-zone level. Along with a feature selector named spatiotemporal dynamic time warping (ST-DTW) algorithm, this proposed MTL-TCNN is quite qualified for the multi-task prediction problem with the consideration of spatiotemporal correlations. Then, based on the car-calling demand data from Didi Chuxing, Chengdu, China, and taxi demand data from the New York City, the numerical results show that the MTL-TCNN outperforms both classic methods (i.e., historical average (HA), v -support vector machine (v -SVM), and XGBoost) and the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches [e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)] in both the single task learning (STL) and multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios. In summary, the proposed MTL-TCNN with the ST-DTW algorithm is a promising method for short-term passenger demand prediction in a multi-zone level.

It is difficult to optimize the weights in the neural networks that have multiple hidden layers due to the vanishing gradient issue. This paper proposes an autoencoder based framework for structural damage identification, which can support deep neural networks and be utilized to obtain optimal solutions for pattern recognition problems of highly non-linear nature, such as learning a mapping between the vibration characteristics and structural damage. Two main components are defined in the proposed framework, namely, dimensionality reduction and relationship learning. The first component is to reduce the dimensionality of the original input vector while preserving the required necessary information, and the second component is to perform the relationship learning between the features with the reduced dimensionality and the stiffness reduction parameters of the structure. Vibration characteristics, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes, are used as the input and the structural damage are considered as the output vector. A pre-training scheme is performed to train the hidden layers in the autoencoders layer by layer, and fine tuning is conducted to optimize the whole network. Numerical and experimental investigations on steel frame structures are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework, comparing with the traditional ANN methods.

J	Fan, JL; Zheng, J; Wu, LF; Zhang, FC				Fan, Junliang; Zheng, Jing; Wu, Lifeng; Zhang, Fucang			Estimation of daily maize transpiration using support vector machines, extreme gradient boosting, artificial and deep neural networks models	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Transpiration; Support vector machines; Extreme gradient boosting; Artificial neural networks; Deep neural networks	JARVIS-STEWART MODEL; STAND-SCALE TRANSPIRATION; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; SAP-FLOW; REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; DIFFERENT CLIMATES; INTERCEPTION LOSS; LOESS PLATEAU; CANOPY; WATER	Accurate measurement or estimation of plant transpiration (T) is of great significance for understanding crop water use, predicting crop yield and designing irrigation schedule in agricultural production. Nevertheless, direct measurement of T is difficult, expensive, destructive and time-consuming. This study explored the applicability of support vector machines (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), single-layer artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep neural networks (DNN) models for estimating daily T of summer maize in Northwest China. Four input combinations of meteorological (T-max, T-min, RH, U and R-s), soil (SWC) and crop (LAI) variables were employed to explore the effects of various variables on daily T estimation. The whole dataset during the four maize growing seasons of 2015-2018 were randomly divided into two subsets: 80% for model training and 20% for model testing. The results showed that the performances of the four machine learning models improved by 10.1-13.1%, 15.7-23.8% and 36.1-46.2% in terms of RMSE during testing when SWC (0.556-0.675 mm d(-1)), LAI (0.477-0.621 mm d(-1)) and both of them (0.344-0.482 mm d(-1)) were further incorporated respectively, compared to models with only meteorological variables as inputs (0.621-0.754 mm d(-1)). DNN models (R-2 = 0.816-954, RMSE = 0.344-0.621 d(-1), MAE = 0.256-0.445 mm d(-1) and NSE = 0.902-0.972) slightly outperformed SVM models (R-2 = 0.731-0.948, RMSE = 0.370-0.688 mm d(-1), MAE = 0.286-0.500 mm d(-1) and NSE = 0.880-0.967) during testing, followed by XGBoost models (R-2 = 0.739-0.929, RMSE = 0.455-0.721 mm d(-1), MAE = 0.355-0.519 mm;d(-1) and NSE = 0.872-0.947) and ANN models (R-2 = 0.683-0.913, RMSE = 0.482-0.754 mm d(-1), MAE = 0.368-0.545 mm d(-1) and NSE = 0.840-0.936) under the four input combinations. The incorporation of SWC or/and LAI in the machine learning models is highly recommended for accurate daily maize T estimation. The DNN model is more effective for daily maize T estimation due to its advantage in modeling high-order complex relationships between T and its driving variables through multiple levels of feature abstraction.

The Lower Goru Formation is one of the principal formations in the Lower Indus Basin, Pakistan. Its substantial hydrocarbon potential is unexplored, as most of the wells within the Sawan gas field are facing relatively low production yields. This study aimed to delineate subsurface geobodies by developing a facies model to study the depositional processes and facies distributions that have been neglected previously. The interactive approaches used in this research consisted of petrophysical, mineral composition, well-log facies, and horizon attribute analyses, as well as an unsupervised vector quantizer artificial neural network (UVQ-ANN) and sequential indicator simulation (SIS) modeling. A series of E-W-oriented lenticular geobodies were delineated. These geobodies had variable thicknesses, and they pinch out to the NW and prograde to the NE. The results of the SIS, UVQ-ANN, petrographic analysis, and attribute analysis show a fluvial fan-delta sedimentary system. The reservoir sands were deposited in distributary mouth bars and deltaic channels in proximal delta front settings. The coarse- to very fine-grained reservoir sands prograde toward the NE. Thinly laminated beds of fine-grained black shales and lime muddy siltstones were deposited under low-energy conditions in mid-shelf marine settings. The adopted methodology for the generated facies model can be extended to different basins within Pakistan with the same geological settings, and it can be used for prospect evaluation, future drilling, and development plans within the Sawan gas field in the Lower Indus Basin.

With an estimated 1 billion slum dwellers globally, the United Nations have made the fight against poverty the number one sustainable development goal. To provide better infrastructure and thus a better life to slum dwellers, detailed information on the spatial location and size of slums is of crucial importance. In the past, remote sensing has proven to be an extremely valuable and effective tool for mapping slums. The nature of used mapping approaches by machine learning, however, made it necessary to invest a lot of effort in training the models. Recent advances in deep learning allow for transferring trained fully convolutional networks (FCN) from one data set to another. Thus, in our study we aim at analyzing transfer learning capabilities of FCNs to slum mapping in various satellite images. A model trained on very high resolution optical satellite imagery from QuickBird is transferred to Sentinel-2 and TerraSAR-X data. While free-of-charge Sentinel 2 data is widely available, its comparably lower resolution makes slum mapping a challenging task. TerraSAR-X data on the other hand, has a higher resolution and is considered a powerful data source for infra-urban structure analysis. Due to the different image characteristics of SAR compared to optical data, however, transferring the model could not improve the performance of semantic segmentation but we observe very high accuracies for mapped slums in the optical data: QuickBird image obtains 86-88% (positive prediction value and sensitivity) and a significant increase for Sentinel-2 applying transfer learning can be observed (from 38 to 55% and from 79 to 85% for PPV and sensitivity, respectively). Using transfer learning proofs extremely valuable in retrieving information on small-scaled urban structures such as slum patches even in satellite images of decametric resolution.

When a natural choice of the graph is not readily available from the data sets, it is thus desirable to infer or learn a graph topology from the data. In this article, we survey solutions to the problem of graph learning, including classical viewpoints from statistics and physics, and more recent approaches that adopt a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We further emphasize the conceptual similarities and differences between classical and GSP-based graph-inference methods and highlight the potential advantage of the latter in a number of theoretical and practical scenarios. We conclude with several open issues and challenges that are keys to the design of future signal processing and machine-learning algorithms for learning graphs from data.

Due to the remarkable effectiveness in such problems, deep learning-based domain adaptation approaches have been attracting increasing attention. However, the existing methods in the literature are generally lower compared to environmental noise and data availability, and it is difficult to achieve promising performance under harsh practical conditions. This paper proposes a new cross-domain fault diagnosis method with enhanced robustness. Noisy labels are introduced to significantly increase the generalization ability of the data-driven model. Promising diagnosis performance can be obtained with strong noise interference in testing, as well as in practical cases with low-quality data.

As a dominating technique in AI, deep learning has been successfully used to solve various 2D vision problems. However, deep learning on point clouds is still in its infancy due to the unique challenges faced by the processing of point clouds with deep neural networks. Recently, deep learning on point clouds has become even thriving, with numerous methods being proposed to address different problems in this area. To stimulate future research, this paper presents a comprehensive review of recent progress in deep learning methods for point clouds. It covers three major tasks, including 3D shape classification, 3D object detection and tracking, and 3D point cloud segmentation. It also presents comparative results on several publicly available datasets, together with insightful observations and inspiring future research directions.

Since the beginning of the recent deep learning renaissance, the medical imaging research community has developed deep learning-based approaches and achieved the state-of-the-art in many applications, including image registration. The rapid adoption of deep learning for image registration applications over the past few years necessitates a comprehensive summary and outlook, which is the main scope of this survey. This requires placing a focus on the different research areas as well as highlighting challenges that practitioners face. This survey, therefore, outlines the evolution of deep learning-based medical image registration in the context of both research challenges and relevant innovations in the past few years. Further, this survey highlights future research directions to show how this field may be possibly moved forward to the next level.

J	Li, Y; Zeng, JB; Shan, SG				Li, Yong; Zeng, Jiabei; Shan, Shiguang			Learning Representations for Facial Actions From Unlabeled Videos	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Facial action unit detection; self-supervised learning; representation learning; feature disentanglement; encoder-decoder structure		Facial actions are usually encoded as anatomy-based action units (AUs), the labelling of which demands expertise and thus is time-consuming and expensive. To alleviate the labelling demand, we propose to leverage the large number of unlabelled videos by proposing a twin-cycle autoencoder (TAE) to learn discriminative representations for facial actions. TAE is inspired by the fact that facial actions are embedded in the pixel-wise displacements between two sequential face images (hereinafter, source and target) in the video. Therefore, learning the representations of facial actions can be achieved by learning the representations of the displacements. However, the displacements induced by facial actions are entangled with those induced by head motions. TAE is thus trained to disentangle the two kinds of movements by evaluating the quality of the synthesized images when either the facial actions or head pose is changed, aiming to reconstruct the target image. Experiments on AU detection show that TAE can achieve accuracy comparable to other existing AU detection methods including some supervised methods, thus validating the discriminant capacity of the representations learned by TAE. TAE's ability in decoupling the action-induced and pose-induced movements is also validated by visualizing the generated images and analyzing the facial image retrieval results qualitatively and quantitatively.

J	Fischer, T; Krauss, C				Fischer, Thomas; Krauss, Christopher			Deep learning with long short-term memory networks for financial market predictions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Finance; Statistical arbitrage; LSTM; Machine learning; Deep leaming	NEURAL-NETWORKS; STATISTICAL ARBITRAGE; OUTRANKING; STRATEGIES	Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a state-of-the-art technique for sequence learning. They are less commonly applied to financial time series predictions, yet inherently suitable for this domain. We deploy LSTM networks for predicting out-of-sample directional movements for the constituent stocks of the S&P 500 from 1992 until 2015. With daily returns of 0.46 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 5.8 prior to transaction costs, we find LSTM networks to outperform memory-free classification methods, i.e., a random forest (RAF), a deep neural net (DNN), and a logistic regression classifier (LOG). The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading - they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs. Further regression analysis unveils low exposure of the LSTM returns to common sources of systematic risk also compared to the three benchmark models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are neural networks that are capable of leveraging the structure of a network. However, many implicit assumptions of GCNs do not apply to road networks. We introduce the Relational Fusion Network (RFN), a novel type of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed specifically for road networks. In particular, we propose methods that outperform state-of-the-art GCN architectures by up to 21-40% on two machine learning tasks in road networks. Furthermore, we show that state-of-the-art GCNs may fail to effectively leverage road network structure and may not generalize well to other road networks.

With the advancement of various AI and machine learning technologies the evolution toward improved decision making as well as data-driven intelligent manufacturing has already been evident. However, several emerging issues, including the poisoning attacks, performance, and inadequate data resources, etc., have to be resolved. Recent research works studied the problem lightly, which often leads to unreliable performance, inefficiency, and privacy leakage. In this article, we developed a decentralized paradigm for big data-driven cognitive computing (D2C), using federated learning and blockchain jointly. Federated learning can solve the problem of "data island" with privacy protection and efficient processing while blockchain provides incentive mechanism, fully decentralized fashion, and robust against poisoning attacks. Using blockchain-enabled federated learning help quick convergence with advanced verifications and member selections. Extensive evaluation and assessment findings demonstrate D2C's effectiveness relative to existing leading designs and models.

Therefore, the current study has aimed to verify the output of shear capacity of angle shear connector according to the input provided by Support Vector Machine (SVM) coupled with Firefly Algorithm (H A). SVM parameters have been optimized through the use of FFA, while genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been applied to estimate and predict the SVM-FFA models' results. Following these results, GP and ANN have been applied to develop the prediction accuracy and generalization capability of SVM-FFA Therefore, SVM-FFA could be performed as a novel model with predictive strategy in the shear capacity estimation of angle shear connectors. According to the results, the Firefly algorithm has produced a generalized performance and be learnt faster than the conventional learning algorithms.	[Chahnasir, E.

Research on geopolymer composites is accelerating. However, considerable work, expense, and time are needed to cast, cure, and test specimens. The application of computational methods to the stated objective is critical for speedy and cost-effective research. In this study, supervised machine learning approaches were employed to predict the compressive strength of geopolymer composites. One individual machine learning approach, decision tree, and two ensembled machine learning approaches, AdaBoost and random forest, were used. The coefficient correlation (R-2), statistical tests, and k-fold analysis were used to determine the validity and comparison of all models. It was discovered that ensembled machine learning techniques outperformed individual machine learning techniques in forecasting the compressive strength of geopolymer composites. However, the outcomes of the individual machine learning model were also within the acceptable limit. R-2 values of 0.90, 0.90, and 0.83 were obtained for AdaBoost, random forest, and decision models, respectively. The models' decreased error values, such as mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root-mean-square errors, further confirmed the ensembled machine learning techniques' increased precision. Machine learning approaches will aid the building industry by providing quick and cost-effective methods for evaluating material properties.

The inputs are transferred and placed in the feature nodes, and then sent into the enhancement nodes for nonlinear transformation. The structure of a BLS can be extended in a wide sense. Incremental learning algorithms are designed for fast learning in broad expansion. Based on the typical BLSs, a novel recurrent BLS (RBLS) is proposed in this paper. The nodes in the enhancement units of the BLS are recurrently connected, for the purpose of capturing the dynamic characteristics of a time series. A sparse autoencoder is used to extract the features from the input instead of the randomly initialized weights. In this way, the RBLS retains the merit of fast computing and fits for processing sequential data. Motivated by the idea of "fine-tuning" in deep learning, the weights in the RBLS can be updated by conjugate gradient methods if the prediction errors are large. We exhibit the merits of our proposed model on several chaotic time series. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of the RBLS. For chaotic benchmark datasets, the RBLS achieves very small errors, and for the real-world dataset, the performance is satisfactory.

In this paper, we present a space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) edge/cloud computing architecture for offloading the computation-intensive applications considering remote energy and computation constraints, where flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide near-user edge computing and satellites provide access to the cloud computing. First, for UAV edge servers, we propose a joint resource allocation and task scheduling approach to efficiently allocate the computing resources to virtual machines (VMs) and schedule the offloaded tasks. Second, we investigate the computing offloading problem in SAGIN and propose a learningbased approach to learn the optimal offloading policy from the dynamic SAGIN environments. Specifically, we formulate the offloading decision making as a Markov decision process where the system state considers the network dynamics. To cope with the system dynamics and complexity, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based computing offloading approach to learn the optimal offloading policy on-the-fly, where we adopt the policy gradient method to handle the large action space and actor-critic method to accelerate the learning process. Simulation results show that the proposed edge VM allocation and task scheduling approach can achieve near-optimal performance with very low complexity and the proposed learning-based computing offloading algorithm not only converges fast but also achieves a lower total cost compared with other offloading approaches.
