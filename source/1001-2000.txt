This study surveys stateoftheart deep-learning methods in defect detection. First, we classify the defects of products, such as electronic components, pipes, welded parts, and textile materials, into categories. Second, recent mainstream techniques and deep-learning methods for defects are reviewed with their characteristics, strengths, and shortcomings described. Third, we summarize and analyze the application of ultrasonic testing, filtering, deep learning, machine vision, and other technologies used for defect detection, by focusing on three aspects, namely method and experimental results. To further understand the difficulties in the field of defect detection, we investigate the functions and characteristics of existing equipment used for defect detection. The core ideas and codes of studies related to high precision, high positioning, rapid detection, small object, complex background, occluded object detection and object association, are summarized. Lastly, we outline the current achievements and limitations of the existing methods, along with the current research challenges, to assist the research community on defect detection in setting a further agenda for future studies.

In this study, we proposed and validated three ensemble models based on the Best First Decision Tree (BFT) and the Bagging (Bagging-BFT), Decorate (Bagging-BFT), and Random Subspace (RSS-BFT) ensemble learning techniques for an improved prediction of flood susceptibility in a spatially-explicit manner. A total number of 126 historical flood events from the Nghe An Province (Vietnam) were connected to a set of 10 flood influencing factors (slope, elevation, aspect, curvature, river density, distance from rivers, flow direction, geology, soil, and land use) for generating the training and validation datasets. The models were validated via several performance metrics that demonstrated the capability of all three ensemble models in elucidating the underlying pattern of flood occurrences within the research area and predicting the probability of future flood events. Based on the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), the ensemble Decorate-BFT model that achieved an AUC value of 0.989 was identified as the superior model over the RSS-BFT (AUC = 0.982) and Bagging-BFT (AUC = 0.967) models. A comparison between the performance of the models and the models previously reported in the literature confirmed that our ensemble models provided a reliable estimate of flood susceptibilities and their resulting susceptibility maps are trustful for flood earlywarning systems aswell as development ofmitigation plans.

Selecting appropriate hyperparameters is often critical for achieving satisfactory performance in many vision problems, such as deep learning-based visual object tracking. However, it is often difficult to determine their optimal values, especially if they are specific to each video input. Most hyperparameter optimization algorithms tend to search a generic range and are imposed blindly on all sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamical hyperparameter optimization method that adaptively optimizes hyperparameters for a given sequence using an action-prediction network leveraged on continuous deep Q-learning. Since the observation space for object tracking is significantly more complex than those in traditional control problems, existing continuous deep Q-learning algorithms cannot be directly applied. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient heuristic strategy to handle high dimensional state space, while also accelerating the convergence behavior. The proposed algorithm is applied to improve two representative trackers, a Siamese-based one and a correlation-filter-based one, to evaluate its generalizability. Their superior performances on several popular benchmarks are clearly demonstrated. Our source code is available at https://github.com/shenjianbing/dqltracking.

J	Schuld, M; Sweke, R; Meyer, JJ				Schuld, Maria; Sweke, Ryan; Meyer, Johannes Jakob			Effect of data encoding on the expressive power of variational quantum-machine-learning models	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							BARREN PLATEAUS	Quantum computers can be used for supervised learning by treating parametrized quantum circuits as models that map data inputs to predictions. While a lot of work has been done to investigate the practical implications of this approach, many important theoretical properties of these models remain unknown. Here, we investigate how the strategy with which data are encoded into the model influences the expressive power of parametrized quantum circuits as function approximators. We show that one can naturally write a quantum model as a partial Fourier series in the data, where the accessible frequencies are determined by the nature of the data-encoding gates in the circuit. By repeating simple data-encoding gates multiple times, quantum models can access increasingly rich frequency spectra. We show that there exist quantum models which can realize all possible sets of Fourier coefficients, and therefore, if the accessible frequency spectrum is asymptotically rich enough, such models are universal function approximators.

Marine ecology is no exception. New methods provide analysis of data from sensors, cameras, and acoustic recorders, even in real time, in ways that are reproducible and rapid. Off-the-shelf algorithms find, count, and classify species from digital images or video and detect cryptic patterns in noisy data. These endeavours require collaboration across ecological and data science disciplines, which can be challenging to initiate. To promote the use of DL towards ecosystem-based management of the sea, this paper aims to bridge the gap between marine ecologists and computer scientists. We provide insight into popular DL approaches for ecological data analysis, focusing on supervised learning techniques with deep neural networks, and illustrate challenges and opportunities through established and emerging applications of DL to marine ecology. We present case studies on plankton, fish, marine mammals, pollution, and nutrient cycling that involve object detection, classification, tracking, and segmentation of visualized data. We conclude with a broad outlook of the field's opportunities and challenges, including potential technological advances and issues with managing complex data sets.

It has solved problems beyond the realm of traditional, hand-crafted machine learning algorithms and captured the imagination of practitioners who are inundated with all types of data. As public awareness of the efficacy of DL increases so does the desire to make use of it. But even for highly trained professionals it can be daunting to approach the rapidly increasing body of knowledge in the field. Where does one start? How does one determine if a particular DL model is applicable to their problem? How does one train and deploy them? With these questions in mind, we present an overview of some of the key DL architectures. We also discuss some new automatic architecture optimization protocols that use multi-agent approaches. Further, since guaranteeing system uptime is critical to many applications, a section dwells on using DL for fault detection and mitigation. This is followed by an exploratory survey of several areas where DL emerged as a game-changer: fraud detection in financial applications, financial time-series forecasting, predictive and prescriptive analytics, medical image processing, power systems research and recommender systems. The thrust of this review is to outline emerging applications of DL and provide a reference to researchers seeking to use DL in their work for pattern recognition with unparalleled learning capacity and the ability to scale with data.

The existing content caching schemes, when used in vehicular networks, face two distinct challenges: 1) Vehicles connected to an edge server keep moving, making the content popularity varying and hard to predict. 2) Cached content is easily out-of-date since each connected vehicle stays in the area of an edge server for a short duration. To address these challenges, we propose a Mobility-aware Proactive edge Caching scheme based on Federated learning (MPCF). This new scheme enables multiple vehicles to collaboratively learn a global model for predicting content popularity with the private training data distributed on local vehicles. MPCF also employs a Context-aware Adversarial AutoEncoder to predict the highly dynamic content popularity. Besides, MPCF integrates a mobility-aware cache replacement policy, which allows the network edges to add/evict contents in response to the mobility patterns and preferences of vehicles. MPCF can greatly improve cache performance, effectively protect users' privacy and significantly reduce communication costs. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCF outperforms other baseline caching schemes in terms of the cache hit ratio in vehicular edge networks.

Owing to the advancements in the field of high-resolution remote sensing, and the success of semantic segmentation success using deep learning in computer version, extracting the road network from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly popular, and has become a new tool to update the geospatial database. Considering that the training dataset of the deep convolutional neural network will be clipped to a fixed size, which lead to the roads run through each sample, and that different kinds of road types have different widths, this work provides a segmentation model that was designed based on densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) and introduces the local and global attention units. The aim of this work is to propose a novel road extraction method that can efficiently extract the road network from remote sensing imagery with local and global information. A dataset from Google Earth was used to validate the method, and experiments showed that the proposed deep convolutional neural network can extract the road network accurately and effectively. This method also achieves a harmonic mean of precision and recall higher than other machine learning and deep learning methods.

J	Zhu, J; Chen, N; Shen, CQ				Zhu, Jun; Chen, Nan; Shen, Changqing			A New Deep Transfer Learning Method for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Different Working Conditions	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Feature extraction; Fault diagnosis; Kernel; Deep learning; Sensors; Employee welfare; Convolution; Convolutional neural network; maximum mean discrepancy; transfer learning; fault diagnosis	NETWORK; RECOGNITION	Fault diagnosis is very important for condition based maintenance. Recently, deep learning models are introduced to learn hierarchical representations from raw data instead of using hand-crafted features, which exhibit excellent performance. The success of current deep learning lies in: 1) the training (source domain) and testing (target domain) datasets are from the same feature distribution; 2) Enough labeled data with fault information exist. However, because the machine operates under a non-stationary working condition, the trained model built on the source domain can not be directly applied on the target domain. Moreover, since no sufficient labeled or even unlabeled data are available in target domain, collecting the labeled data and building the model from scratch is time-consuming and expensive. Motivated by transfer learning (TL), we present a new fault diagnosis method, which generalizes convolutional neural network (CNN) to TL scenario. Two layers with regard to task-specific features are adapted in a layer-wise way to regularize the parameters of CNN. What's more, the domain loss is calculated by a linear combination of multiple Gaussian kernels so that the ability of adaptation is enhanced compared to single kernel. Through these two means, the distribution discrepancy is reduced and the transferable features are learned. The proposed method is validated by transfer fault diagnosis experiments. Compared to CNN without domain adaptation and shallow transfer learning methods, the proposed method gets the best performance for fault classification.

Artificial intelligence encompasses a variety of areas, and one of its branches is deep learning (DL). Before the rise of DL, conventional machine learning algorithms involving feature extraction were performed. This limited their performance to the ability of those handcrafting the features. However, in DL, the extraction of features and classification are entirely automated. The advent of these techniques in many areas of medicine, such as in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, has made significant advances. In this study, a comprehensive overview of works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using DL techniques and neuroimaging modalities is presented. Various methods proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures automatically using EEG and MRI modalities are described. In addition, rehabilitation systems developed for epileptic seizures using DL have been analyzed, and a summary is provided. The rehabilitation tools include cloud computing techniques and hardware required for implementation of DL algorithms. The important challenges in accurate detection of automated epileptic seizures using DL with EEG and MRI modalities are discussed. The advantages and limitations in employing DL-based techniques for epileptic seizures diagnosis are presented. Finally, the most promising DL models proposed and possible future works on automated epileptic seizure detection are delineated.

The major concept is to reduce the error amount between the empirical output voltage and the evaluated output voltage of the PEM fuel cell stack model using the proposed hybrid AlexNet/ELM. For enhancing the model formation of the AlexNet/ELM, a modified version of the African Vulture Optimization (MAVO) Algorithm, which is a new metaheuristic, is suggested. To analyze the efficiency of the suggested method, it is applied to a practical PEMFC benchmark case study for identification purposes. Then, the method is confirmed by comparison of the experimental data and standard AlexNet/ELM. The achievements indicated the better confirmation of the suggested AlexNet/ELM network with the experimental data. The results show that the highest relative error for training and test is 0.03% and 0.05342%, respectively, which shows a promising result for the study.

In this study, we demonstrate how transfer learning from deep learning models can be used to perform COVID-19 detection using images from three most commonly used medical imaging modes X-Ray, Ultrasound, and CT scan. The aim is to provide over-stressed medical professionals a second pair of eyes through intelligent deep learning image classification models. We identify a suitable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model through initial comparative study of several popular CNN models. We then optimize the selected VGG19 model for the image modalities to show how the models can be used for the highly scarce and challenging COVID-19 datasets. We highlight the challenges (including dataset size and quality) in utilizing current publicly available COVID-19 datasets for developing useful deep learning models and how it adversely impacts the trainability of complex models. We also propose an image pre-processing stage to create a trustworthy image dataset for developing and testing the deep learning models. The new approach is aimed to reduce unwanted noise from the images so that deep learning models can focus on detecting diseases with specific features from them. Our results indicate that Ultrasound images provide superior detection accuracy compared to X-Ray and CT scans. The experimental results highlight that with limited data, most of the deeper networks struggle to train well and provides less consistency over the three imaging modes we are using. The selected VGG19 model, which is then extensively tuned with appropriate parameters, performs in considerable levels of COVID-19 detection against pneumonia or normal for all three lung image modes with the precision of up to 86% for X-Ray, 100% for Ultrasound and 84% for CT scans.

While these developments have always been to the benefit of image interpretation and machine vision, only recently has it become evident that machine learning architectures, and deep neural networks in particular, can be effective for computational image formation, aside from interpretation. The deep learning approach has proven to be especially attractive when the measurement is noisy and the measurement operator ill posed or uncertain. Examples reviewed here are: super-resolution; lensless retrieval of phase and complex amplitude from intensity; photon-limited scenes, including ghost imaging; and imaging through scatter. In this paper, we cast these works in a common framework. We relate the deep-learning-inspired solutions to the original computational imaging formulation and use the relationship to derive design insights, principles, and caveats of more general applicability. We also explore how the machine learning process is aided by the physics of imaging when ill posedness and uncertainties become particularly severe. It is hoped that the present unifying exposition will stimulate further progress in this promising field of research.

They harness non-local regularities of noisy control trajectories and facilitate transfer learning between tasks. To leverage these powerful capabilities for quantum control optimization, we propose a new control framework to simultaneously optimize the speed and fidelity of quantum computation against both leakage and stochastic control errors. For a broad family of two-qubit unitary gates that are important for quantum simulation of many-electron systems, we improve the control robustness by adding control noise into training environments for reinforcement learning agents trained with trusted-region-policy-optimization. The agent control solutions demonstrate a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in average-gate-error over baseline stochastic-gradient-descent solutions and up to a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in gate time from optimal gate synthesis counterparts.

Virtual adversarial loss is defined as the robustness of the conditional label distribution around each input data point against local perturbation. Unlike adversarial training, our method defines the adversarial direction without label information and is hence applicable to semi-supervised learning. Because the directions in which we smooth the model are only "virtually" adversarial, we call our method virtual adversarial training (VAT). The computational cost of VAT is relatively low. For neural networks, the approximated gradient of virtual adversarial loss can be computed with no more than two pairs of forward- and back-propagations. In our experiments, we applied VAT to supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks on multiple benchmark datasets. With a simple enhancement of the algorithm based on the entropy minimization principle, our VATachieves state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning tasks on SVHN and CIFAR-10.

With the rapid development of modern industries, physical model is becoming less capable of describing sophisticated systems, and data-driven approaches have been widely developed. This paper proposes a novel intelligent remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method based on deep learning. The time-frequency domain information is explored for prognostics, and multi-scale feature extraction is implemented using convolutional neural networks. Experiments on a popular rolling bearing dataset prepared from the PRONOSTIA platform are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and its superiority is demonstrated by the comparisons with other approaches. In general, high accuracy on the RUL prediction is achieved, and the proposed method is promising for industrial applications.

However, the available data from bearings used in real-case machines (BRMs) are insufficient to train a reliable intelligent diagnosis model. Fortunately, we can easily simulate various faults of bearings in a laboratory, and the data from bearings used in laboratory machines (BLMs) contain diagnosis knowledge related to the data from BRMs. Therefore, inspired by the idea of transfer learning, we propose a feature-based transfer neural network (FTNN) to identify the health states of BRMs with the help of the diagnosis knowledge from BLMs. In the proposed method, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to extract transferable features of raw vibration data from BLMs and BRMs. Then, the regularization terms of multi-layer domain adaptation and pseudo label learning are developed to impose constraints on the parameters of CNN so as to reduce the distribution discrepancy and the among-class distance of the learned transferable features. The proposed method is verified by two fault diagnosis cases of bearings, in which the health states of locomotive bearings in real cases are identified by using the data respectively collected from motor bearings and gearbox bearings in laboratories. The results show that the proposed method is able to effectively learn transferable features to bridge the discrepancy between the data from BLMs and BRMs. Consequently, it presents higher diagnosis accuracy for BRMs than existing methods.

The Big Data comprises of speech and video. In the proposed system, a speech signal is first processed in the frequency domain to obtain a Mel-spectrogram, which can be treated as an image. Then this Mel-spectrogram is fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). For video signals, some representative frames from a video segment are extracted and fed to the CNN. The outputs of the two CNNs are fused using two consecutive extreme learning machines (ELMs). The output of the fusion is given to a support vector machine (SVM) for final classification of the emotions. The proposed system is evaluated using two audio-visual emotional databases, one of which is Big Data. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system involving the CNNs and the ELMs.	[Hossain, M.

This technique provides a promising privacy preservation for mobile devices while simultaneously ensuring high learning performance. The majority of existing work has focused on designing advanced learning algorithms with an aim to achieve better learning performance. However, the challenges, such as incentive mechanisms for participating in training and worker (i.e., mobile devices) selection schemes for reliable federated learning, have not been explored yet. These challenges have hindered the widespread adoption of federated learning. To address the above challenges, in this article, we first introduce reputation as the metric to measure the reliability and trustworthiness of the mobile devices. We then design a reputation-based worker selection scheme for reliable federated learning by using a multiweight subjective logic model. We also leverage the blockchain to achieve secure reputation management for workers with nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties in a decentralized manner. Moreover, we propose an effective incentive mechanism combining reputation with contract theory to motivate high-reputation mobile devices with high-quality data to participate in model learning. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed schemes are efficient for reliable federated learning in terms of significantly improving the learning accuracy.

The prevalence rate of COVID-19 is rapidly rising every day throughout the globe. Although no vaccines for this pandemic have been discovered yet, deep learning techniques proved themselves to be a powerful tool in the arsenal used by clinicians for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. This paper aims to overview the recently developed systems based on deep learning techniques using different medical imaging modalities like Computer Tomography (CT) and X-ray. This review specifically discusses the systems developed for COVID-19 diagnosis using deep learning techniques and provides insights on well-known data sets used to train these networks. It also highlights the data partitioning techniques and various performance measures developed by researchers in this field. A taxonomy is drawn to categorize the recent works for proper insight. Finally, we conclude by addressing the challenges associated with the use of deep learning methods for COVID-19 detection and probable future trends in this research area. The aim of this paper is to facilitate experts (medical or otherwise) and technicians in understanding the ways deep learning techniques are used in this regard and how they can be potentially further utilized to combat the outbreak of COVID-19.

Inspired by the recent success of deep learning and the filter method in computer vision, this work provides a segmentation model, which designs an image segmentation neural network based on the deep residual networks and uses a guided filter to extract buildings in remote sensing imagery. Our method includes the following steps: first, the VHR remote sensing imagery is preprocessed and some hand-crafted features are calculated. Second, a designed deep network architecture is trained with the urban district remote sensing image to extract buildings at the pixel level. Third, a guided filter is employed to optimize the classification map produced by deep learning; at the same time, some salt-and-pepper noise is removed. Experimental results based on the Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that our method, which benefits from neural networks and guided filtering, achieves a higher overall accuracy when compared with other machine learning and deep learning methods. The method proposed shows outstanding performance in terms of the building extraction from diversified objects in the urban district.

J	Shen, Y; Zhu, SJ; Chen, C; Du, Q; Xiao, L; Chen, JY; Pan, DL				Shen, Yu; Zhu, Sijie; Chen, Chen; Du, Qian; Xiao, Liang; Chen, Jianyu; Pan, Delu			Efficient Deep Learning of Nonlocal Features for Hyperspectral Image Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Data mining; Kernel; Machine learning; Support vector machines; Neural networks; Computational modeling; Fully convolutional network (FCN); hyperspectral image (HSI) classification; long-range contextual information; nonlocal module	REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK; CNN	Deep-learning-based methods, such as convolution neural network (CNN), have demonstrated their efficiency in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. These methods can automatically learn spectral-spatial discriminative features within local patches. However, for each pixel in an HSI, it is not only related to its nearby pixels but also has connections to pixels far away from itself. Therefore, to incorporate the long-range contextual information, a deep fully convolutional network (FCN) with an efficient nonlocal module, named ENL-FCN, is proposed for HSI classification. In the proposed framework, a deep FCN considers an entire HSI as input and extracts spectral-spatial information in a local receptive field. The efficient nonlocal module is embedded in the network as a learning unit to capture the long-range contextual information. Different from the traditional nonlocal neural networks, the long-range contextual information is extracted in a specially designed criss-cross path for computation efficiency. Furthermore, using a recurrent operation, each pixelx2019;s response is aggregated from all pixels of HSI. The benefits of our proposed ENL-FCN are threefold: 1) the long-range contextual information is incorporated effectively; 2) the efficient module can be freely embedded in a deep neural network in a plug-and-play fashion; and 3) it has much fewer learning parameters and requires less computational resources. The experiments conducted on three popular HSI data sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art classification performance with lower computational cost in comparison with several leading deep neural networks for HSI.

Here, rather than amending classical machine learning, we argue that these contextual cues should be used as part of deep learning (an approach that is able to extract spatio-temporal features automatically) to gain further process understanding of Earth system science problems, improving the predictive ability of seasonal forecasting and modelling of long-range spatial connections across multiple timescales, for example. The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.

A CNN based classification architecture was trained and tested, with the accuracy, recall, and specificity of 96.5%, 100.0%, and 92.9%, respectively, for the testing set. An inferior performance was obtained by a traditional image processing method based on candidate defective regions counting and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, with the accuracy, recall, and specificity of 87.1%, 90.9%, and 83.3%, respectively. The CNN-based model was loaded into the custom software to validate its performance using independent 200 apples, obtaining an accuracy of 92% with a processing time below 72 ms for six images of an apple fruit. The overall results indicated that the proposed CNN-based classification model had great potential to be implemented in commercial packing line.

J	Zhu, GX; Wang, Y; Huang, KB				Zhu, Guangxu; Wang, Yong; Huang, Kaibin			Broadband Analog Aggregation for Low-Latency Federated Edge Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Computational modeling; Wireless communication; Broadband communication; Signal to noise ratio; Servers; Artificial intelligence; Measurement; Edge intelligence; federated learning; multiple access; over-the-air computation	FUNCTION COMPUTATION; MOBILITY	To leverage rich data distributed at the network edge, a new machine-learning paradigm, called edge learning, has emerged where learning algorithms are deployed at the edge for providing intelligent services to mobile users. While computing speeds are advancing rapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge learning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low-latency multi-access scheme for edge learning. To this end, we consider a popular privacy-preserving framework, federated edge learning (FEEL), where a global AI-model at an edge-server is updated by aggregating (averaging) local models trained at edge devices. It is proposed that the updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over broadband channels should be analog aggregated "over-the-air" by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. Such broadband analog aggregation (BAA) results in dramatical communication-latency reduction compared with the conventional orthogonal access (i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the effects of BAA on learning performance are quantified targeting a single-cell random network. First, we derive two tradeoffs between communication-and-learning metrics, which are useful for network planning and optimization. The power control ("truncated channel inversion") required for BAA results in a tradeoff between the update-reliability [as measured by the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] and the expected update-truncation ratio. Consider the scheduling of cell-interior devices to constrain path loss. This gives rise to the other tradeoff between the receive SNR and fraction of data exploited in learning. Next, the latency-reduction ratio of the proposed BAA with respect to the traditional OFDMA scheme is proved to scale almost linearly with the device population. Experiments based on a neural network and a real dataset are conducted for corroborating the theoretical results.

NATURE REVIEWS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							NEURAL-NETWORKS; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; PARIETAL CORTEX; GRID CELLS; MEMORY; REPRESENTATIONS; SYSTEMS; MODELS; HIPPOCAMPAL; MAP	Neuroscience research is undergoing a minor revolution. Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics and neural representations in artificial and biological systems, and we highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning. Deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. Here, Saxe, Nelli and Summerfield offer a road map of how neuroscientists can use deep networks to model and understand biological brains.

In this paper, we consider a VEC network with dynamic topologies, unstable connections and unpredictable movements. Vehicles inside can offload computation tasks to available neighboring VEC clusters formed by onboard resources, with the purpose of both minimizing system energy consumption and satisfying task latency constraints. For online task scheduling, existing researches either design heuristic algorithms or leverage machine learning, e.g., deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, these algorithms are not efficient enough because of their low searching efficiency and slow convergence speeds for large-scale networks. Instead, we propose an imitation learning enabled online task scheduling algorithm with near-optimal performance from the initial stage. Specially, an expert can obtain the optimal scheduling policy by solving the formulated optimization problem with a few samples offline. For online learning, we train agent policies by following the expert's demonstration with an acceptable performance gap in theory. Performance results show that our solution has a significant advantage with more than 50 percent improvement compared with the benchmark.

To accelerate the experiments in an efficient, sustainable, and economic way, machine learning (ML) tools were employed for bridging the inputs and outputs, which can realize the prediction of hydrochar properties, and development of ML-based optimization for achieving desired hydrochar. The results showed that deep neural network (DNN) model was the best one for joint prediction of both fuel properties (FP) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) stability of hydrochar with an average R-2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.91 and 3.29. The average testing prediction errors for all the targets were below 20%, furtherly within 10% for HHV, carbon content and H/C predictions. ML-based feature analysis unveiled that both elementary composition and temperature were crucial to FP and CCS. Furthermore, a ML-based software interface was provided for practitioners and researchers to freely access. The insights and Pareto solution provided from ML-based multi-objective optimization benefitted desired hydrochar preparation for the potential application of fuel substitution or carbon sequestration in soil.

Usually, visual information is captured by a frame-based camera, converted into a digital format and processed afterwards using a machine-learning algorithm such as an artificial neural network (ANN)(1). The large amount of (mostly redundant) data passed through the entire signal chain, however, results in low frame rates and high power consumption. Various visual data preprocessing techniques have thus been developed(2-7) to increase the efficiency of the subsequent signal processing in an ANN. Here we demonstrate that an image sensor can itself constitute an ANN that can simultaneously sense and process optical images without latency. Our device is based on a reconfigurable two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor(8,9) photodiode(10-12) array, and the synaptic weights of the network are stored in a continuously tunable photoresponsivity matrix. We demonstrate both supervised and unsupervised learning and train the sensor to classify and encode images that are optically projected onto the chip with a throughput of 20 million bins per second.

An infection caused by COVID-19 can develop into pneumonia, which can be detected by a chest X-ray exam and should be treated appropriately. In this work, we propose an automatic detection method for COVID-19 infection based on chest X-ray images. The datasets constructed for this study are composed of 194 X-ray images of patients diagnosed with coronavirus and 194 X-ray images of healthy patients. Since few images of patients with COVID-19 are publicly available, we apply the concept of transfer learning for this task. We use different architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on ImageNet, and adapt them to behave as feature extractors for the X-ray images. Then, the CNNs are combined with consolidated machine learning methods, such as k-Nearest Neighbor, Bayes, Random Forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM). The results show that, for one of the datasets, the extractor-classifier pair with the best performance is the MobileNet architecture with the SVM classifier using a linear kernel, which achieves an accuracy and an F1-score of 98.5%. For the other dataset, the best pair is DenseNet201 with MLP, achieving an accuracy and an F1-score of 95.6%. Thus, the proposed approach demonstrates efficiency in detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images.

Here, we use statistical and machine learning (ML) modeling approaches to simulate the present and future changes of MAGT and ALT in the permafrost regions of the QTP. The results show that the combination of statistical and ML method is reliable to simulate the MAGT and ALT, with the root-mean-square error of 0.53 degrees C and 0.69 m for the MAGT and ALT, respectively. The results show that the present (2000-2015) permafrost area on the QTP is 1.04 x 10(6) km(2) (0.80-1.28 x 10(6) km(2)), and the average MAGT and ALT are -1.35 +/- 0.42 degrees C and 2.3 +/- 0.60 m, respectively. According to the classification system of permafrost stability, 37.3% of the QTP permafrost is suffering from the risk of disappearance. In the future (2061-2080), the near-surface permafrost area will shrink significantly under different Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs). It is predicted that the permafrost area will be reduced to 42% of the present area under RCP8.5. Overall, the future changes of MAGT and ALT are pronounced and region-specific. As a result, the combined statistical method with ML requires less parameters and input variables for simulation permafrost thermal regimes and could present an efficient way to figure out the response of permafrost to climatic changes on the QTP.

Despite the incessant efforts of cybersecurity research to defend against malware threats, malware developers discover new ways to evade these defense techniques. Traditional static and dynamic analysis methods are ineffective in identifying new malware and pose high overhead in terms of memory and time. Typical machine learning approaches that train a classifier based on handcrafted features are also not sufficiently potent against these evasive techniques and require more efforts due to feature-engineering. Recent malware detectors indicate performance degradation due to class imbalance in malware datasets. To resolve these challenges, this work adopts a visualization-based method, where malware binaries are depicted as two-dimensional images and classified by a deep learning model. We propose an efficient malware detection system based on deep learning. The system uses a reweighted class-balanced loss function in the final classification layer of the DenseNet model to achieve significant performance improvements in classifying malware by handling imbalanced data issues. Comprehensive experiments performed on four benchmark malware datasets show that the proposed approach can detect new malware samples with higher accuracy (98.23% for the Malimg dataset, 98.46% for the BIG 2015 dataset, 98.21% for the MaleVis dataset, and 89.48% for the unseen Malicia dataset) and reduced false-positive rates when compared with conventional malware mitigation techniques while maintaining low computational time. The proposed malware detection solution is also reliable and effective against obfuscation attacks.

These approaches perform well on tasks like information extraction, but their ability to identify complex, socially constructed, and unsettled theoretical concepts-a central goal of sociological content analysis-has not been tested. To fill this gap, we compare the results produced by three common computer-assisted approaches-dictionary, supervised machine learning (SML), and unsupervised machine learning-to those produced through a rigorous hand-coding analysis of inequality in the news (N = 1,253 articles). Although we find that SML methods perform best in replicating hand-coded results, we document and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including how they can complement one another. We argue that content analysts in the social sciences would do well to keep all these approaches in their toolkit, deploying them purposefully according to the task at hand.

Its learning of non-linear feature combinations has played a role that traditional machine learning cannot reach in almost every field. The application of Deep Learning has also driven the advancement of Factorization Machine (FM) in the field of recommendation systems, because Deep Learning and FM can learn high-order and low-order features combinations respectively, and FM's hidden vector system enables it to learn information from sparse data. The integration of them has attracted the attention of many scholars. They have researched many classic models such as Factorization-supported Neural Network (FNN), Product-based Neural Networks (PNN), Inner PNN (IPNN), Wide&Deep, Deep&Cross, DeepFM, etc. for the Click-Through-Rate (CTR) problem, and their performance is getting better and better. This kind of model is also suitable for agriculture, meteorology, disease prediction and other fields due to the above advantages. Based on the DeepFM model, we predicts the incidence of hepatitis in each sample in the structured disease prediction data of the 2020 Artificial Intelligence Challenge Preliminary Competition, and make minor improvements and parameter adjustments to DeepFM. Compared with other models, the improved DeepFM has excellent performance in AUC. This research can be applied to electronic medical records to reduce the workload of doctors and make doctors focus on the samples with higher predicted incidence rates. For some changing data, such as blood pressure, height, weight, cholesterol, etc., we can introduce the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT's sensors can be used to conduct transmission to ensure that the disease can be predicted in time, just in case. After joining IoMT, a healthcare system is formed, which is superior in forecasting and time performance.

We address this problem by taking advantage of recent advances in scientific machine learning and the spectral dynamically orthogonal (DO) and borthogonal (BO) methods for representing stochastic processes. The recently introduced DO/BO methods reduce the SPDE to solving a system of deterministic PDEs and a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations. Specifically, we propose two new physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving time-dependent SPDEs, namely the neural network (NN)-DO/BO methods. The proposed methods incorporate the DO/BO constraints into the loss function (along with the modal decomposition of the SPDE) with an implicit form instead of generating explicit expressions for the temporal derivatives of the DO/BO modes. Hence, the NN-DO/BO methods can overcome some of the drawbacks of the original DO/BO methods. For example, we do not need the assumption that the covariance matrix of the random coefficients is invertible as in the original DO method, and we can remove the assumption of no eigenvalue crossing as in the original BO method. Moreover, the NN-DO/BO methods can be used to solve time-dependent stochastic inverse problems with the same formulation and same computational complexity as for forward problems. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods via several numerical examples, namely: (1) A linear stochastic advection equation with deterministic initial condition: we obtain good results with the proposed methods, while the original DO/BO methods cannot be applied directly in this case. (2) Long-time integration of the stochastic Burgers' equation: we show the good performance of NN-DO/BO methods, especially the effectiveness of the NN-BO approach for such problems with many eigenvalue crossings during the whole time evolution, while the original BO method fails. (3) Nonlinear reaction diffusion equation: we consider both the forward problem and the inverse problems, including very noisy initial point values, to investigate the flexibility of the NN-DO/BO methods in handling inverse and mixed type problems. Taken together, these simulation results demonstrate that the NN-DO/BO methods can be employed to effectively quantify uncertainty propagation in a wide range of physical problems, but future work should address the efficiency issue of PINNs for forward problems.

The activities performed over the network could be effortlessly proliferated, which has led to the emergence of intrusion detection systems. The patterns of the attacks are also dynamic, which necessitates efficient classification and prediction of cyber attacks. In this paper we propose a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA)-firefly based machine learning model to classify intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. The dataset used in the study is collected from Kaggle. The model first performs One-Hot encoding for the transformation of the IDS datasets. The hybrid PCA-firefly algorithm is then used for dimensionality reduction. The XGBoost algorithm is implemented on the reduced dataset for classification.

The tremendous success of these methods is generally based on the assumption that the label spaces across different domains are identical. However, the partial transfer scenario is more common for industrial applications, where the label spaces are not identical. This partial transfer scenario arises a more difficult problem that it is hard to know where to transfer since the shared label spaces are unavailable. To tackle this challenging problem, a double-layer attention based adversarial network (DA-GAN) is proposed in this paper. The proposed method sheds a new angle to deal with the question where to transfer by constructing two attention matrices for domains and samples. These attention matrices could guide the model to know which parts of data should be concentrated or ignored before conducting domain adaptation. Experimental results on both transfer in the identical machine (TIM) and transfer on different machines (TDM) suggest that the DA-GAN model shows great superiority on mechanical partial transfer problem.

J	Ismael, AM; Sengur, A				Ismael, Aras M.; Sengur, Abdulkadir			Deep learning approaches for COVID-19 detection based on chest X-ray images	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						COVID-19; Chest X-ray images; Deep learning; Convolutional neural networks; Local texture descriptors	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; PATTERN	COVID-19 is a novel virus that causes infection in both the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The numbers of cases and deaths have increased on a daily basis on the scale of a global pandemic. Chest X-ray images have proven useful for monitoring various lung diseases and have recently been used to monitor the COVID-19 disease. In this paper, deep-learning-based approaches, namely deep feature extraction, fine-tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN), and end-to-end training of a developed CNN model, have been used in order to classify COVID-19 and normal (healthy) chest X-ray images. For deep feature extraction, pretrained deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19) were used. For classification of the deep features, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was used with various kernel functions, namely Linear, Quadratic, Cubic, and Gaussian. The aforementioned pretrained deep CNN models were also used for the fine-tuning procedure. A new CNN model is proposed in this study with end-to-end training. A dataset containing 180 COVID-19 and 200 normal (healthy) chest X-ray images was used in the study's experimentation. Classification accuracy was used as the performance measurement of the study. The experimental works reveal that deep learning shows potential in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images. The deep features extracted from the ResNet50 model and SVM classifier with the Linear kernel function produced a 94.7% accuracy score, which was the highest among all the obtained results. The achievement of the fine-tuned ResNet50 model was found to be 92.6%, whilst end-to-end training of the developed CNN model produced a 91.6% result. Various local texture descriptors and SVM classifications were also used for performance comparison with alternative deep approaches; the results of which showed the deep approaches to be quite efficient when compared to the local texture descriptors in the detection of COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images.

It will be shown that the data-driven approaches should not replace, but rather complement, traditional design techniques based on mathematical models. Extensive motivation is given for why deep learning based on artificial neural networks will be an indispensable tool for the design and operation of future wireless communication networks, and our vision of how artificial neural networks should be integrated into the architecture of future wireless communication networks is presented. A thorough description of deep learning methodologies is provided, starting with the general machine learning paradigm, followed by a more in-depth discussion about deep learning and artificial neural networks, covering the most widely used artificial neural network architectures and their training methods. Deep learning will also be connected to other major learning frameworks, such as reinforcement learning and transfer learning. A thorough survey of the literature on deep learning for wireless communication networks is provided, followed by a detailed description of several novel case studies wherein the use of deep learning proves extremely useful for network design. For each case study, it will be shown how the use of (even approximate) mathematical models can significantly reduce the amount of live data that needs to be acquired/measured to implement the data-driven approaches. Finally, concluding remarks describe those that, in our opinion, are the major directions for future research in this field.

At first, we construct maps depicting the most effective factors on floods (12 factors), forest fires (10 factors), and landslides (10 factors), and used the Boruta algorithm to prioritize the impact of each respective factor on the occurrence of each hazard. Subsequently, flood, landslides, and forest fire susceptibility maps prepared using a Random Forest (RF) model in the R statistical software. Results indicate that 42.83% of the study area are not susceptible to any hazards, while 2.67% of the area is at risk of all three hazards. The results of the multi-hazard map in Shiraz City indicate that 25% of Shiraz city is very susceptible to flooding, while 16% is very susceptible to landslide occurrences. For four strategic watersheds, it is notable that in the Dorodzan Watershed, landslides and floods are the most important hazards; whereas, flood occurrences cover the largest area of the Maharlou Watershed. In contrast, the Tashk-Bakhtegan Watershed is so sensible to floods and landslides, respectively. Finally, in the Ghareaghaj Watershed, forest fire ranks as the strongest hazard, followed by floods. The validation results indicate an AUC of 0.834, 0.939, and 0.943 for the flood, landslide, and forest fire susceptibility maps, respectively. Also, other accuracy measures including, specificity, sensitivity, TSS, CCI, and Gini coefficient confirmed results of the AUC values. These results allow us to forecast the spatial behavior of such multi-hazard events, and researchers and stakeholders alike can apply them to evaluate hazards under various mitigation scenarios.

Stacked generalization: an introduction to super learning	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Ensemble learning; Machine learning; Super Learner; Stacked generalization; Stacked regression	PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATION; PREDICTION; MORTALITY	Stacked generalization is an ensemble method that allows researchers to combine several different prediction algorithms into one. Since its introduction in the early 1990s, the method has evolved several times into a host of methods among which is the "Super Learner''. Super Learner uses V-fold cross-validation to build the optimal weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. Optimality is defined by a user-specified objective function, such as minimizing mean squared error or maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Although relatively simple in nature, use of Super Learner by epidemiologists has been hampered by limitations in understanding conceptual and technical details. We work step-by-step through two examples to illustrate concepts and address common concerns.

Hybrid context enriched deep learning model for fine-grained sentiment analysis in textual and visual semiotic modality social data	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multimodal; Sentiment analysis; Deep learning; Context; BoVW	STRENGTH DETECTION; AUDIO	Detecting sentiments in natural language is tricky even for humans, making its automated detection more complicated. This research proffers a hybrid deep learning model for fine-grained sentiment prediction in real-time multimodal data. It reinforces the strengths of deep learning nets in combination to machine learning to deal with two specific semiotic systems, namely the textual (written text) and visual (still images) and their combination within the online content using decision level multimodal fusion. The proposed contextual ConvNet-SVMBovw model, has four modules, namely, the discretization, text analytics, image analytics, and decision module. The input to the model is multimodal text, m epsilon {text, image, info-graphic}. The discretization module uses Google Lens to separate the text from the image, which is then processed as discrete entities and sent to the respective text analytics and image analytics modules. Text analytics module determines the sentiment using a hybrid of a convolution neural network (ConvNet) enriched with the contextual semantics of SentiCircle. An aggregation scheme is introduced to compute the hybrid polarity. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained using bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) for predicting the visual content sentiment. A Boolean decision module with a logical OR operation is augmented to the architecture which validates and categorizes the output on the basis of five fine-grained sentiment categories (truth values), namely 'highly positive,' positive,"neutral,"negative' and 'highly negative.' The accuracy achieved by the proposed model is nearly 91% which is an improvement over the accuracy obtained by the text and image modules individually.

J	Sambasivam, G; Opiyo, GD				Sambasivam, G.; Opiyo, Geoffrey Duncan			A predictive machine learning application in agriculture: Cassava disease detection and classification with imbalanced dataset using convolutional neural networks	EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL			English	Article						Agriculture; Cassava mosaic detection; Rectifier Linear Unit; Synthetic minority over-sampling technique; Stochastic gradient descent		This work is inspired by Kaggle competition which was part of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization workshop at CVPR 2019 (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) we participated in. It aimed at detecting cassava diseases using 5 fine-grained cassava leaf disease categories with 10,000, labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Traditionally, this detection is done mostly through physical inspection and supervision of cassava plants in the garden by farmers or agricultural extension workers from NAADS (National Agricultural Advisory Services) and then reported to NARO (National Agricultural Advisory Services) for further analysis. However, this can be tiresome, capital intensive, and lacks the ability to detect cassava infection timely to help farmers apply preventive techniques to the non-infected cassava plants in order to improve on yields which subsequently increases African food basket leading to food security which fights famine. Using the dataset provided to train CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to achieve high accuracy was very challenging due to two reasons: the dataset was small in size and has high-class imbalance being heavily biased towards CMD (Cassava Mosaic Disease) and CBB (Cassava Brown Streak Virus Disease) classes. Class imbalance is problematic in machine learning and exists in many domains. Note that, not all world data is balanced, in fact, most of the time you will not be extremely lucky to get a perfectly balanced real-world dataset, in recent years, a lot of research has been done for two-class problems such as fraudulent credit card and tumor detection among others. Interestingly, class imbalance in multi-class image datasets has received little attention. This paper, therefore, focused on techniques to achieve an accuracy score of over 93% with class weight, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and focal loss with deep convolutional neural networks from scratch. The goal was to counter high-class imbalance so that the model can accurately predict underrepresented classes. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Concepts for improving hydrogen storage in nanoporous materials	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Hydrogen storage materials; Hydrogen adsorption; Nanoporous materials; Metal-organic frameworks; Machine learning	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; ULTRAHIGH SURFACE-AREA; TARGETED SYNTHESIS; POROUS MATERIALS; METHANE STORAGE; FUEL-CELL; ADSORPTION; DENSITY; MOF-5; INTERPENETRATION	Hydrogen storage in nanoporous materials has been attracting a great deal of attention in recent years, as high gravimetric H-2 capacities, exceeding 10 wt% in some cases, can be achieved at 77 K using materials with particularly high surface areas. However, volumetric capacities at low temperatures, and both gravimetric and volumetric capacities at ambient temperature, need to be improved before such adsorbents become practically viable. This article therefore discusses approaches to increasing the gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage capacities of nanoporous materials, and maximizing the usable capacity of a material between the upper storage and delivery pressures. In addition, recent advances in machine learning and data science provide an opportunity to apply this technology to the search for new materials for hydrogen storage. The large number of possible component combinations and substitutions in various porous materials, including Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), is ideally suited to a machine learning approach; so this is also discussed, together with some new material types that could prove useful in the future for hydrogen storage applications.

Impact of Deep Learning Assistance on the Histopathologic Review of Lymph Nodes for Metastatic Breast Cancer	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Review						artificial intelligence; machine learning; digital pathology; breast cancer; computer aided detection	ISOLATED TUMOR-CELLS; DIGITAL PATHOLOGY; CARCINOMA; DIAGNOSIS	Advances in the quality of whole-slide images have set the stage for the clinical use of digital images in anatomic pathology. Along with advances in computer image analysis, this raises the possibility for computer-assisted diagnostics in pathology to improve histopathologic interpretation and clinical care. To evaluate the potential impact of digital assistance on interpretation of digitized slides, we conducted a multireader multicase study utilizing our deep learning algorithm for the detection of breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes. Six pathologists reviewed 70 digitized slides from lymph node sections in 2 reader modes, unassisted and assisted, with a wash-out period between sessions. In the assisted mode, the deep learning algorithm was used to identify and outline regions with high likelihood of containing tumor. Algorithm-assisted pathologists demonstrated higher accuracy than either the algorithm or the pathologist alone. In particular, algorithm assistance significantly increased the sensitivity of detection for micrometastases (91% vs. 83%, P=0.02). In addition, average review time per image was significantly shorter with assistance than without assistance for both micrometastases (61 vs. 116s, P = 0.002) and negative images (111 vs. 137s, P = 0.018). Lastly, pathologists were asked to provide a numeric score regarding the difficulty of each image classification. On the basis of this score, pathologists considered the image review of micrometastases to be significantly easier when interpreted with assistance (P = 0.0005). Utilizing a proof of concept assistant tool, this study demonstrates the potential of a deep learning algorithm to improve pathologist accuracy and efficiency in a digital pathology workflow.

Yet, such analyses are often required during the design of thermal and process equipment. As a remedy, this paper puts forward a novel approach to the prediction of transport behaviours of multiphysics systems, offering significant reductions in the computational time and cost. This is based on machine learning techniques that utilize the data generated by computational fluid dynamics for training purposes. The physical system under investigation includes a stagnation-point flow of a hybrid nanofluid (Cu-Al2O3/Water) over a blunt object embedded in porous media. The problem further involves mixed convection, entropy generation, local thermal non-equilibrium and non-linear thermal radiation within the porous medium. The SVR (Support Machine Vector) model is employed to approximate velocity, temperature, Nusselt number and shear-stress as well as entropy generation and Bejan number functions. Further, PSO meta-heuristic algorithm is applied to propose correlations for Nusselt number and shear stress. The effects of Nusselt number, temperature fields and shear stress on the surface of the blunt-body as well as thermal and frictional entropy generation are analysed over a wide range of parameters. Further, it is shown that the generated correlations allow a quantitative evaluation of the contribution of a large number of variables to Nusselt number and shear stress. This makes the combined computational and artificial intelligence (AI) approach most suitable for design purposes. (C) 2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since 2015, image-based 3D reconstruction using convolutional neural networks (CNN) has attracted increasing interest and demonstrated an impressive performance. Given this new era of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in this field. We focus on the works which use deep learning techniques to estimate the 3D shape of generic objects either from a single or multiple RGB images. We organize the literature based on the shape representations, the network architectures, and the training mechanisms they use. While this survey is intended for methods which reconstruct generic objects, we also review some of the recent works which focus on specific object classes such as human body shapes and faces. We provide an analysis and comparison of the performance of some key papers, summarize some of the open problems in this field, and discuss promising directions for future research.

In this study, we put forth a robust machine learning framework for projection-based reduced-order modeling of such nonlinear and nonstationary systems. As a demonstration, we focus on a nonlinear advection-diffusion system given by the viscous Burgers equation, which is a prototypical setting of more realistic fluid dynamics applications due to its quadratic nonlinearity. In our proposed methodology the effects of truncated modes are modeled using a single layer feed-forward neural network architecture. The neural network architecture is trained by utilizing both the Bayesian regularization and extreme learning machine approaches, where the latter one is found to be more computationally efficient. A significant emphasis is laid on the selection of basis functions through the use of both Fourier bases and proper orthogonal decomposition. It is shown that the proposed model yields significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Galerkin projection methodology with a negligibly small computational overhead and provide reliable predictions with respect to parameter changes.

RBM finds wide applications in dimensional reduction, feature extraction, and recommender systems via modeling the probability distributions of a variety of input data including natural images, speech signals, and customer ratings, etc. We build a bridge between RBM and tensor network states (TNS) widely used in quantum many-body physics research. We devise efficient algorithms to translate an RBM into the commonly used TNS. Conversely, we give sufficient and necessary conditions to determine whether a TNS can be transformed into an RBM of given architectures. Revealing these general and constructive connections can cross fertilize both deep learning and quantum many-body physics. Notably, by exploiting the entanglement entropy bound of TNS, we can rigorously quantify the expressive power of RBM on complex data sets. Insights into TNS and its entanglement capacity can guide the design of more powerful deep learning architectures. On the other hand, RBM can represent quantum many-body states with fewer parameters compared to TNS, which may allow more efficient classical simulations.

Compared to traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms, DL methods still have a long way to go to achieve recognition in small molecular drug discovery and development. And there is still lots of work to do for the popularization and application of DL for research purpose, e.g., for small molecule drug research and development. In this review, we mainly discussed several most powerful and mainstream architectures, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and deep auto-encoder networks (DAENs), for supervised learning and nonsupervised learning; summarized most of the representative applications in small molecule drug design; and briefly introduced how DL methods were used in those applications. The discussion for the pros and cons of DL methods as well as the main challenges we need to tackle were also emphasized.

However, most current optimization-based methods lack a self-adaptive ability in dynamic environments. To tackle these challenges, current learning-based approaches are generally proposed in a centralized way. However, network resources may be overconsumed during the training and data transmission process. To address the complex and dynamic control issues, we propose a federated deep-reinforcement-learning-based cooperative edge caching (FADE) framework. FADE enables base stations (BSs) to cooperatively learn a shared predictive model by considering the first-round training parameters of the BSs as the initial input of the local training, and then uploads near-optimal local parameters to the BSs to participate in the next round of global training. Furthermore, we prove the expectation convergence of FADE. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FADE framework on reducing the performance loss and average delay, offloading backhaul traffic, and improving the hit rate.

J	Zhou, ZH; Feng, J				Zhou, Zhi-Hua; Feng, Ji			Deep forest	NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW			English	Article						deep forest; deep learning; machine learning; ensemble methods; decision trees	CLASSIFICATION	Current deep-learning models are mostly built upon neural networks, i.e. multiple layers of parameterized differentiable non-linear modules that can be trained by backpropagation. In this paper, we explore the possibility of building deep models based on non-differentiable modules such as decision trees. After a discussion about the mystery behind deep neural networks, particularly by contrasting them with shallow neural networks and traditional machine-learning techniques such as decision trees and boosting machines, we conjecture that the success of deep neural networks owes much to three characteristics, i.e. layer-by-layer processing, in-model feature transformation and sufficient model complexity. On one hand, our conjecture may offer inspiration for theoretical understanding of deep learning; on the other hand, to verify the conjecture, we propose an approach that generates deep forest holding these characteristics. This is a decision-tree ensemble approach, with fewer hyper-parameters than deep neural networks, and its model complexity can be automatically determined in a data-dependent way. Experiments show that its performance is quite robust to hyper-parameter settings, such that in most cases, even across different data from different domains, it is able to achieve excellent performance by using the same default setting. This study opens the door to deep learning based on non-differentiable modules without gradient-based adjustment, and exhibits the possibility of constructing deep models without backpropagation.

Complex foraging behaviours in wild birds emerge from social learning and recombination of components	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						cumulative cultural evolution; social learning; social networks; Parus major; animal culture; NBDA	CULTURAL-EVOLUTION; DIFFUSION ANALYSIS; TOOL USE; TRANSMISSION; POPULATION; ACQUISITION; PERSPECTIVE; CHIMPANZEES; CONFORMITY; TRADITIONS	Recent well-documented cases of cultural evolution towards increasing efficiency in non-human animals have led some authors to propose that other animals are also capable of cumulative cultural evolution, where traits become more refined and/or complex over time. Yet few comparative examples exist of traits increasing in complexity, and experimental tests remain scarce. In a previous study, we introduced a foraging innovation into replicate subpopulations of great tits, the 'sliding-door puzzle'. Here, we track diffusion of a second 'dial puzzle', before introducing a two-step puzzle that combines both actions. We mapped social networks across two generations to ask if individuals could: (1) recombine socially-learned traits and (2) socially transmit a two-step trait. Our results show birds could recombine skills into more complex foraging behaviours, and naive birds across both generations could learn the two-step trait. However, closer interrogation revealed that acquisition was not achieved entirely through social learning-rather, birds socially learned components before reconstructing full solutions asocially. As a consequence, singular cultural traditions failed to emerge, although subpopulations of birds shared preferences for a subset of behavioural variants. Our results show that while tits can socially learn complex foraging behaviours, these may need to be scaffolded by rewarding each component. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.	[Wild, S.; Chimento, M.; Aplin, L.

It might be the worst of times, but it might be the best of times because of opportunities brought by machine learning (ML), in particular deep learning (DL). In general, DL delivers superior performance to ML because of its layered setting and its effective algorithm for extract useful information from training data. DL models are adopted quickly to cyber attacks against CPS systems. In this survey, a holistic view of recently proposed DL solutions is provided to cyber attack detection in the CPS context. A six-step DL driven methodology is provided to summarize and analyze the surveyed literature for applying DL methods to detect cyber attacks against CPS systems. The methodology includes CPS scenario analysis, cyber attack identification, ML problem formulation, DL model customization, data acquisition for training, and performance evaluation. The reviewed works indicate great potential to detect cyber attacks against CPS through DL modules. Moreover, excellent performance is achieved partly because of several high-quality datasets that are readily available for public use. Furthermore, challenges, opportunities, and research trends are pointed out for future research.

J	Hou, SK; Liu, YR; Yang, Q				Hou, Shaokang; Liu, Yaoru; Yang, Qiang			Real-time prediction of rock mass classification based on TBM operation big data and stacking technique of ensemble learning	JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Tunnel boring machine (TBM) operation data; Rock mass classification; Stacking ensemble learning; Sample imbalance; Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)	PERFORMANCE PREDICTION; TUNNEL; AGREEMENT; FRAMEWORK	Real-time prediction of the rock mass class in front of the tunnel face is essential for the adaptive adjustment of tunnel boring machines (TBMs). During the TBM tunnelling process, a large number of operation data are generated, reflecting the interaction between the TBM system and surrounding rock, and these data can be used to evaluate the rock mass quality. This study proposed a stacking ensemble classifier for the real-time prediction of the rock mass classification using TBM operation data. Based on the Songhua River water conveyance project, a total of 7538 TB M tunnelling cycles and the corresponding rock mass classes are obtained after data preprocessing. Then, through the tree-based feature selection method, 10 key TBM operation parameters are selected, and the mean values of the 10 selected features in the stable phase after removing outliers are calculated as the inputs of classifiers. The preprocessed data are randomly divided into the training set (90%) and test set (10%) using simple random sampling. Besides stacking ensemble classifier, seven individual classifiers are established as the comparison. These classifiers include support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP), where the hyper-parameters of each classifier are optimised using the grid search method. The prediction results show that the stacking ensemble classifier has a better performance than individual classifiers, and it shows a more powerful learning and generalisation ability for small and imbalanced samples. Additionally, a relative balance training set is obtained by the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and the influence of sample imbalance on the prediction performance is discussed.

The DAEM exploits the higher order continuity of the DAEM and integrates a deep autoencoder and the minimum total potential principle in one framework yielding an unsupervised feature learning method. The DAEM is a specific type of feedforward deep neural network (DNN) and can also serve as function approximator. With robust feature extraction capacity, the DAEM can more efficiently identify patterns behind the whole energy system, such as the field variables, natural frequency and critical buckling load factor studied in this paper. The objective function is to minimize the total potential energy. The DAEM performs unsupervised learning based on generated collocation points inside the physical domain so that the total potential energy is minimized at all points. For the vibration and buckling analysis, the loss function is constructed based on Rayleigh's principle and the fundamental frequency and the critical buckling load is extracted. A scaled hyperbolic tangent activation function for the underlying mechanical model is presented which meets the continuity requirement and alleviates the gradient vanishing/explosive problems under bending. The DAEM is implemented using Pytorch and the LBFGS optimizer. To further improve the computational efficiency and enhance the generality of this machine learning method, we employ transfer learning. A comprehensive study of the DAEM configuration is performed for several numerical examples with various geometries, load conditions, and boundary conditions.

Timely recognition of emotional responses plays a pivotal function at present, with the profound expansion of social media and users of the internet. Mental illnesses are highly hazardous, stirring more than three hundred million people. Moreover, that is why research is focused on this subject. With the advancements of machine learning and the availability of sample data relevant to depression, there is the possibility of developing an early depression diagnostic system, which is key to lessening the number of afflicted individuals. This paper proposes a productive model by implementing the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, consisting of two hidden layers and large bias with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with two dense layers, to predict depression from text, which can be beneficial in protecting individuals from mental disorders and suicidal affairs. We train RNN on textual data to identify depression from text, semantics, and written content. The proposed framework achieves 99.0% accuracy, higher than its counterpart, frequency-based deep learning models, whereas the false positive rate is reduced.

J	Arafat, MY; Moh, S				Arafat, Muhammad Yeasir; Moh, Sangman			A Q-Learning-Based Topology-Aware Routing Protocol for Flying Ad Hoc Networks	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Drone ad hoc network; flying ad hoc network (FANET); machine learning; Q-learning; reinforcement learning; routing; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network; UAV network		Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) have emanated over the last few years for numerous civil and military applications. Owing to underlying attributes, such as a dynamic topology, node mobility in 3-D space, and the limited energy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a routing protocol for FANETs is challenging to design. Exiting topology-based routing is unsuitable for highly dynamic FANETs. Location-based routing protocols can be preferred for FANETs owing to their scalability, but are based on one-hop neighbor information and do not contemplate the reachability of further appropriate nodes for forwarding. Owing to the rapid mobility of UAVs, the topology frequently changes; thus, some route entries in the routing table can become invalid and the next-hop nodes may be unavailable before a timeout. That is, the routing decision based on one-hop neighbors cannot assure a successful delivery. In this study, we propose a novel Q-learning-based topology-aware routing (QTAR) protocol for FANETs to provide reliable combinations between the source and destination. The proposed QTAR improves the routing decision by considering two-hop neighbor nodes, extending the local view of the network topology. With the Q-learning technique, QTAR adaptively adjusts the routing decision according to the network condition. Our simulation results reveal that QTAR outstrips the existing routing protocols in respect of various performance metrics under distinct scenarios.

To help restaurants better understand customers' needs and sustain their business under current circumstance, this study extracts restaurant features that are cared for by customers in current circumstance. This study also introduces deep learning methods to examine customers' opinions about restaurant features and to detect reviews with mismatched ratings. By analyzing 112,412 restaurant reviews posted during January-June 2020 on Yelp.com, four frequently mentioned restaurant features (e.g., service, food, place, and experience) along with their associated sentiment scores were identified. Findings also show that deep learning algorithms (i. e., Bidirectional LSTM and Simple Embedding + Average Pooling) outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in sentiment classification and review rating prediction. This study strengthens the extant literature by empirically analyzing restaurant reviews posted during the COVID-19 pandemic and discovering suitable deep learning algorithms for different text mining tasks.

To alleviate the sensor drift problem, a gas sensor drift compensation approach is proposed based on local discriminant subspace projection (LDSP). The proposed approach aims to find a subspace to reduce the distribution difference between two domains, i.e., the source and target domain. Similar to domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) which is a recently proposed sensor drift correction method, the mean distribution discrepancy is minimized in the common subspace in our approach. LDSP extends DRCA in two aspects, i.e., it not only takes the label information of the source data into consideration to reduce the possibility of the case that samples in the subspace with different class labels stay close to each other, but also borrows the idea of locality-preserving projection to deal with multimodal data. Specifically, inspired by local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA), the label information is utilized to maximize the local between-class variance of source data in the latent common subspace and simultaneously minimize the local within-class variance. The formulation of LDSP is a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be readily solved. The experimental results have shown the proposed method outperforms other gas sensor drift compensation methods in terms of classification accuracy on two public gas sensor drift datasets.

To address the challenge, we propose a novel framework termed Cross Partial Multi-View Networks (CPM-Nets), which aims to fully and flexibly take advantage of multiple partial views. We first provide a formal definition of completeness and versatility for multi-view representation and then theoretically prove the versatility of the learned latent representations. For completeness, the task of learning latent multi-view representation is specifically translated to a degradation process by mimicking data transmission, such that the optimal tradeoff between consistency and complementarity across different views can be implicitly achieved. Equipped with adversarial strategy, our model stably imputes missing views, encoding information from all views for each sample to be encoded into latent representation to further enhance the completeness. Furthermore, a nonparametric classification loss is introduced to produce structured representations and prevent overfitting, which endows the algorithm with promising generalization under view-missing cases. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our algorithm over existing state of the arts for classification, representation learning and data imputation.

Using deep learning to predict soil properties from regional spectral data	GEODERMA REGIONAL			English	Article						Convolutional Neural Networks; Spectrograms; Multi-task learning; Simultaneous prediction	ORGANIC-CARBON; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; TOTAL NITROGEN; NIR; PERFORMANCE; MOISTURE; EVALUATE	Diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy allows the rapid acquisition of soil information in the field or the loboratory. The vis-NIR spectroscopy research enthusiasm around the world has created regional to global soil spectral libraries. While machine learning methods have been utilised in processing spectral data, such large regional datasets are better dealt with big data analytics. Deep learning is an exciting discipline that has already transformed the way data are analysed in many fields and could also change the way we model soil spectral data. This study developed and evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning algorithm, as a new way to predict soil properties from raw soil spectra. We demonstrated the effectiveness of CNNs on the LUCAS soil database, which consists of around 20,000 topsoil observations with physicochemical and biological properties from Europe. To fully utilise the capacity of the CNN model, we represented the soil spectral data as a 2-dimensional spectrogram, showing the reflectance as a function of wavelength and frequency. We showed the capacity of a CNN to be trained in a multi-task setting to simultaneously predict six soil properties in one model (OC, CEC, clay, sand, pH, total N). Compared with conventional methods such as PLS regression and Cubist regression tree, the CNN performed significantly better, especially the multi-tasking model. In the case of soil organic carbon prediction, the multi-task CNN decreased the error by 87% compared to PLS and 62% compared with Cubist. This approach proved to be effective when trained on a relatively large dataset. The high accuracy of CNN makes it an ideal tool for modelling soil spectral data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By combining accurate existing visual classification catalogues with machine learning, we provide the largest and most accurate morphological catalogue up to date. The classifications are obtained with Deep Learning algorithms using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We use two visual classification catalogues, GZ2 and Nair & Abraham (2010), for training CNNs with colour images in order to obtain T-types and a series of GZ2 type questions (disc/features, edge-on galaxies, bar signature, bulge prominence, roundness, and mergers). We also provide an additional probability enabling a separation between pure elliptical (E) from SO, where the T-type model is not so efficient. For the T-type, our results show smaller offset and scatter than previous models trained with support vector machines. For the GZ2 type questions, our models have large accuracy (>97 per cent), precision and recall values (>90 per cent), when applied to a test sample with the same characteristics as the one used for training. The catalogue is publicly released with the paper.	[Sanchez, H. Dominguez; Huertas-Company, M.; Bernardi, M.; Fischer, J.

Since the industrial robot is a complex nonlinear system, the traditional approximate reliability methods often produce unreliable results in analyzing its positioning accuracy. In order to study the positioning accuracy reliability of industrial robot more efficiently and accurately, a radial basis function network is used to construct the mapping relationship between the uncertain parameters and the position coordinates of the end-effector. Combining with the Monte Carlo simulation method, the positioning accuracy reliability is then evaluated. A novel hybrid learning algorithm for training radial basis function network, which integrates the clustering learning algorithm and the orthogonal least squares learning algorithm, is proposed in this article. Examples are presented to illustrate the high proficiency and reliability of the proposed method.

J	Yu, Y; Wang, CY; Gu, XY; Li, JC				Yu, Yang; Wang, Chaoyue; Gu, Xiaoyu; Li, Jianchun			A novel deep learning-based method for damage identification of smart building structures	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Damage identification; smart building; magnetorheological elastomer isolator; deep convolutional neural networks; seismic loading	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FACE RECOGNITION; WORKING; SYSTEM	In the past few years, intelligent structural damage identification algorithms based on machine learning techniques have been developed and obtained considerable attentions worldwide, due to the advantages of reliable analysis and high efficiency. However, the performances of existing machine learning-based damage identification methods are heavily dependent on the selected signatures from raw signals. This will cause the fact that the damage identification method, which is the optimal solution for a specific application, may fail to provide the similar performance on other cases. Besides, the feature extraction is a time-consuming task, which may affect the real-time performance in practical applications. To address these problems, this article proposes a novel method based on deep convolutional neural networks to identify and localise damages of building structures equipped with smart control devices. The proposed deep convolutional neural network is capable of automatically extracting high-level features from raw signals or low-level features and optimally selecting the combination of extracted features via a multi-layer fusion to satisfy any damage identification objective. To evaluate the performance of the proposed deep convolutional neural network method, a five-level benchmark building equipped with adaptive smart isolators subjected to the seismic loading is investigated. The result shows that the proposed method has outstanding generalisation capacity and higher identification accuracy than other commonly used machine learning methods. Accordingly, it is deemed as an ideal and effective method for damage identification of smart structures.

Man against machine: diagnostic performance of a deep learning convolutional neural network for dermoscopic melanoma recognition in comparison to 58 dermatologists	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						melanoma; melanocytic nevi; dermoscopy; deep learning convolutional neural network; computer algorithm; automated melanoma detection	MELANOCYTIC LESIONS; SKIN-LESIONS; EPILUMINESCENCE MICROSCOPY; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; METAANALYSIS; ALGORITHMS; IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; IMPACT	Background: Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN's diagnostic performance to larger groups of dermatologists are lacking. Methods: Google's Inception v4 CNN architecture was trained and validated using dermoscopic images and corresponding diagnoses. In a comparative cross-sectional reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by the CNN versus an international group of 58 dermatologists during level-I or -II of the reader study. Secondary end points included the dermatologists' diagnostic performance in their management decisions and differences in the diagnostic performance of dermatologists during level-I and -II of the reader study. Additionally, the CNN's performance was compared with the top-five algorithms of the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) challenge. Results: In level-I dermatologists achieved a mean (6standard deviation) sensitivity and specificity for lesion classification of 86.6% (69.3%) and 71.3% (611.2%), respectively. More clinical information (level-II) improved the sensitivity to 88.9% (69.6%, P = 0.19) and specificity to 75.7% (611.7%, P<0.05). The CNN ROC curve revealed a higher specificity of 82.5% when compared with dermatologists in level-I (71.3%, P<0.01) and level-II (75.7%, P<0.01) at their sensitivities of 86.6% and 88.9%, respectively. The CNN ROC AUC was greater than the mean ROC area of dermatologists (0.86 versus 0.79, P<0.01). The CNN scored results close to the top three algorithms of the ISBI 2016 challenge. Conclusions: For the first time we compared a CNN's diagnostic performance with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts. Most dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN. Irrespective of any physicians' experience, they may benefit from assistance by a CNN's image classification.	[Haenssle, H.

Federated learning enables clients to collaboratively train models without sharing data. Digital twins provide virtual representation of the air-ground networks to reflect the time-varying status, which in combination with federated learning reconcile the conflict between privacy protection and data training in air-ground networks. In this paper, we consider dynamic digital twin and federated learning for air-ground networks where a drone works as the aggregator and the ground clients collaboratively train the model based on the network dynamics captured by digital twins. We design incentives for federated learning based on Stackelberg game, in which the digital twin of the drone acts as the leader to set preferences for clients, and clients as follower choose the global training rounds. Furthermore, considering the varying digital twin deviations and network dynamics, we design a dynamic incentive scheme to adaptively adjust the selection of the optimal clients and their participation level. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can significantly improve accuracy and energy efficiency.

Machine Learning for Modeling and Control of Industrial Clarifier Process	INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Sugar industry; clarifier process; pH neutralization; system identification; genetic algorithm; particle swarm optimization; state transition algorithm	PREDICTIVE CONTROL	In sugar production, model parameter estimation and controller tuning of the nonlinear clarification process are major concerns. Because the sugar industry's clarification process is difficult and nonlinear, obtaining the exact model using identification methods is critical. For regulating the clarification process and identifying the model parameters, this work presents a state transition algorithm (STA). First, the model parameters for the clarifier are estimated using the normal system identification process. The STA is then utilized to improve the accuracy of the system parameters that have been identified. Metaheuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and State Transition Algorithm are used to evaluate the most accurate model generated by the algorithms. By capturing the principal dynamic features of the process, the clarifier model produced from State Transition Algorithm (STA) acts more like the actual clarifier process. According to the findings, the controllers provided in this paper may be used to achieve greater performance than the standard controller design during the control of any nonlinear procedure, and STA is extremely helpful in modeling a nonlinear process.

J	Wang, ZR; Wang, J; Wang, YR				Wang, Zirui; Wang, Jun; Wang, Youren			An intelligent diagnosis scheme based on generative adversarial learning deep neural networks and its application to planetary gearbox fault pattern recognition	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Planetary gearbox; Fault diagnosis; Generative adversarial networks; Deep stacked denoising autoencoders; Adversarial machine learning; Small samples	ENHANCEMENT; VIBRATION; SVD	Planetary gearbox has complex structures and works under various non-stationary operating conditions. The vibration signals of planetary gearbox are complicated and usually polluted by noise and interference. It is difficult to extract effective features of early faults. In addition, there are only a small number of fault samples for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis. All of these increase the difficulty of planetary gearbox fault diagnosis. Aiming at these problems, a novel fault diagnostic method is proposed which combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE). The generator of GAN can generate new samples which has similar distribution with original samples from planetary gearbox vibration signals. Then, generated samples are transformed to the discriminator together with original samples which expand the sample size. SDAE is used as the discriminator of GAN which can automatically extract effective fault features from input samples and discriminate their authenticity and fault categories. Through novel adversarial machine learning mechanism, the generator and discriminator are concurrently optimized to enhance the quality of generation samples and the ability of fault mode classification. The experimental results show that the developed SDAE-GAN method for planetary gearbox has good anti-noise ability and achieve better fault diagnosis performance in the case of small samples.

Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial data sets spanning a wide variety of chemical end points. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary data sets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.

A machine learning calibration model using random forests to improve sensor performance for lower-cost air quality monitoring	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							FIELD CALIBRATION; ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSORS; AVAILABLE SENSORS; POLLUTION; OZONE; QUANTIFICATION; ENVIRONMENT; CLUSTER; PART	Low-cost sensing strategies hold the promise of denser air quality monitoring networks, which could significantly improve our understanding of personal air pollution exposure. Additionally, low-cost air quality sensors could be deployed to areas where limited monitoring exists. However, low-cost sensors are frequently sensitive to environmental conditions and pollutant cross-sensitivities, which have historically been poorly addressed by laboratory calibrations, limiting their utility for monitoring. In this study, we investigated different calibration models for the Real-time Affordable Multi-Pollutant (RAMP) sensor package, which measures CO, NO2, O-3, and CO2. We explored three methods: (1) laboratory univariate linear regression, (2) empirical multiple linear regression, and (3) machine-learning-based calibration models using random forests (RF). Calibration models were developed for 16-19 RAMP monitors (varied by pollutant) using training and testing windows spanning August 2016 through February 2017 in Pittsburgh, PA, US. The random forest models matched (CO) or significantly outperformed (NO2, CO2, O-3) the other calibration models, and their accuracy and precision were robust over time for testing windows of up to 16 weeks. Following calibration, average mean absolute error on the testing data set from the random forest models was 38 ppb for CO (14% relative error), 10 ppm for CO2 (2% relative error), 3.5 ppb for NO2 (29% relative error), and 3.4 ppb for O-3 (15% relative error), and Pearson r versus the reference monitors exceeded 0.8 for most units. Model performance is explored in detail, including a quantification of model variable importance, accuracy across different concentration ranges, and performance in a range of monitoring contexts including the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. A key strength of the RF approach is that it accounts for pollutant cross-sensitivities. This highlights the importance of developing multipollutant sensor packages (as opposed to single-pollutant monitors); we determined this is especially critical for NO2 and CO2. The evaluation reveals that only the RF-calibrated sensors meet the US EPA Air Sensors Guidebook recommendations of minimum data quality for personal exposure measurement. We also demonstrate that the RF-model-calibrated sensors could detect differences in NO2 concentrations between a near-road site and a suburban site less than 1.5 km away. From this study, we conclude that combining RF models with carefully controlled state-of-the-art multipollutant sensor packages as in the RAMP monitors appears to be a very promising approach to address the poor performance that has plagued low-cost air quality sensors.

J	Feng, CS; Liu, B; Yu, KP; Goudos, SK; Wan, SH				Feng, Chaosheng; Liu, Bin; Yu, Keping; Goudos, Sotirios K.; Wan, Shaohua			Blockchain-Empowered Decentralized Horizontal Federated Learning for 5G-Enabled UAVs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Blockchains; Authentication; Industrial Internet of Things; Training; Data models; Drones; Informatics; 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); cross-domain authentication; federated learning (FL); privacy preservation; smart contract		Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the abovementioned issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal FL framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.

J	Tariq, S; Bakhtawar, B; Zayed, T				Tariq, Salman; Bakhtawar, Beenish; Zayed, Tarek			Data-driven application of MEMS-based accelerometers for leak detection in water distribution networks	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						MEMS; Accelerometers; Leak detection; Real networks; Machine learning; Ensembles	DECISION TREE; LOCALIZATION; MANAGEMENT; PRESSURE; PIPES	Water scarcity is a global concern; 68 countries are facing extremely-high to medium-high risk of water stress. In this era of crisis, where water conservation is an absolute necessity, the water distribution networks (WDNs) globally are experiencing significant leaks. These leaks cause tremendous financial loss and unacceptable environmental hazards, thus further aggravating the water scarcity situation. To minimize such damage, the adoption of advanced technologies and methodologies for leak detection in the WDNs is absolutely necessary. In this regard, we have investigated the application of cost-effective MEMS-based accelerometers. Experiments were conducted on real networks (metal and non-metal pipes), over the course of ten months, and the acquired acceleration signals were analyzed using a monitoring algorithm. Monitoring index efficiencies and standard deviations for every leak and no-leak case was extracted. Two individual [KNN and Decision Tree] and two ensembles [Random Forest and Adaboost (Decision Tree)] based machine learning models were developed for the accurate classification of the leak and no-leak cases using extracted features; and separate models were developed for metal and non-metal pipes. Random Forest outperformed the other machine learning models and the overall accuracy reached 100% for metal pipes and 94.93% for non-metal pipes. The machine learning models were further validated using unseen/unlabeled cases and were highly effective in detecting leaks. This study demonstrated the applicability of MEMS-based accelerometers for leak detection and established real network-based machine learning models thereby contributing to the research scarcity in this important area.

These deep learning algorithms are being applied to biological images and are transforming the analysis and interpretation of imaging data. These advances are positioned to render difficult analyses routine and to enable researchers to carry out new, previously impossible experiments. Here we review the intersection between deep learning and cellular image analysis and provide an overview of both the mathematical mechanics and the programming frameworks of deep learning that are pertinent to life scientists. We survey the field's progress in four key applications: image classification, image segmentation, object tracking, and augmented microscopy. Last, we relay our labs' experience with three key aspects of implementing deep learning in the laboratory: annotating training data, selecting and training a range of neural network architectures, and deploying solutions. We also highlight existing datasets and implementations for each surveyed application.

New data-driven approaches bring out a new research direction for all control-based systems, e.g., in transportation, robotics, IoT and power systems. Combining data-driven applications with transportation systems plays a key role in recent transportation applications. In this paper, the latest deep reinforcement learning (RL) based traffic control applications are surveyed. Specifically, traffic signal control (TSC) applications based on (deep) RL, which have been studied extensively in the literature, are discussed in detail. Different problem formulations, RL parameters, and simulation environments for TSC are discussed comprehensively. In the literature, there are also several autonomous driving applications studied with deep RL models. Our survey extensively summarizes existing works in this field by categorizing them with respect to application types, control models and studied algorithms. In the end, we discuss the challenges and open questions regarding deep RL-based transportation applications.

This paper proposes a fault diagnosis for rolling bearings, based on Generalized Refined Composite Multiscale Sample Entropy (GRCMSE), Supervised Isometric Mapping (S-Isomap) and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm based Support Vector Machine (GOA-SVM). First, GRCMSE is utilized to characterize the complexity of vibration signals, at different scales. Furthermore, an effective manifold learning algorithm, named S-Isomap, is applied, to compress the high-dimensional feature set into a low-dimensional space. Subsequently, GOA-SVM classifier is proposed for pattern recognition, having higher recognition accuracy than other classifiers. The performance of the proposed method has been verified by its successful application in a rolling bearing fault diagnosis experiment. Compared with the existing methods, this approach improves the classification accuracy to 100%. The produced results indicate that the proposed method can effectively detect bearing faults, maintaining high accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Deep learning in nano-photonics: inverse design and beyond	PHOTONICS RESEARCH			English	Review							NEURAL-NETWORKS; ACCELERATION; TRANSMISSION; OPTIMIZATION; INTELLIGENCE; MICROSCOPY	Deep learning in the context of nano-photonics is mostly discussed in terms of its potential for inverse design of photonic devices or nano-structures. Many of the recent works on machine-learning inverse design are highly specific, and the drawbacks of the respective approaches are often not immediately clear. In this review we want therefore to provide a critical review on the capabilities of deep learning for inverse design and the progress which has been made so far. We classify the different deep-learning-based inverse design approaches at a higher level as well as by the context of their respective applications and critically discuss their strengths and weaknesses. While a significant part of the community's attention lies on nano-photonic inverse design, deep learning has evolved as a tool for a large variety of applications. The second part of the review will focus therefore on machine learning research in nano-photonics "beyond inverse design." This spans from physics-informed neural networks for tremendous acceleration of photonics simulations, over sparse data reconstruction, imaging and "knowledge discovery" to experimental applications.

We argue that it is time to take a step back and to analyze the status quo of the area. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. First, given the fact that there is no agreed upon zero-shot learning benchmark, we first define a new benchmark by unifying both the evaluation protocols and data splits of publicly available datasets used for this task. This is an important contribution as published results are often not comparable and sometimes even flawed due to, e.g., pre-training on zero-shot test classes. Moreover, we propose a new zero-shot learning dataset, the Animals with Attributes 2 (AWA2) dataset which we make publicly available both in terms of image features and the images themselves. Second, we compare and analyze a significant number of the state-of-the-art methods in depth, both in the classic zero-shot setting but also in the more realistic generalized zero-shot setting. Finally, we discuss in detail the limitations of the current status of the area which can be taken as a basis for advancing it.

This perspective aims at highlighting some of the recent advances achieved by implementing artificial intelligence, specifically artificial neutral networks, towards tribological research. The presentation and discussion of successful case studies using these approaches in a tribological context clearly demonstrates their ability to accurately and efficiently predict these tribological characteristics. Regarding future research directions and trends, we emphasis on the extended use of artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts in the field of tribology including the characterization of the resulting surface topography and the design of lubricated systems.

This is because it can be used to detect anomalies, analyse failures and predict the future state based on up-to-date information. By utilising condition data and on-site feedback, data models can be trained using machine learning and statistical concepts. Once trained, the logic for data processing can be embedded on on-board controllers whilst enabling real-time health assessment and analysis. However, this integration inevitably faces several difficulties and challenges for the community; indicating the need for novel approaches to address this vexing issue. Deep learning has gained increasing attention due to its potential advantages with data classification and feature extraction problems. It is an evolving research area with diverse application domains and hence its use for system health management applications must been researched if it can be used to increase overall system resilience or potential cost benefits for maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. This article presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence based system health management with an emphasis on recent trends of deep learning within the field. Various architectures and related theories are discussed to clarify its potential. Based on the reviewed work, deep learning demonstrates plausible benefits for fault diagnosis and prognostics. However, there are a number of limitations that hinder its widespread adoption and require further development. Attention is paid to overcoming these challenges, with future opportunities being enumerated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Machine learning techniques have great potential to improve medical diagnostics, offering ways to improve accuracy, reproducibility and speed, and to ease workloads for clinicians. In the field of histopathology, deep learning algorithms have been developed that perform similarly to trained pathologists for tasks such as tumor detection and grading. However, despite these promising results, very few algorithms have reached clinical implementation, challenging the balance between hope and hype for these new techniques. This Review provides an overview of the current state of the field, as well as describing the challenges that still need to be addressed before artificial intelligence in histopathology can achieve clinical value.

J	Barbedo, JGA				Arnal Barbedo, Jayme Garcia			Impact of dataset size and variety on the effectiveness of deep learning and transfer learning for plant disease classification	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Image processing; Deep neural nets; Image database; Disease classification	IDENTIFICATION	The problem of automatic recognition of plant diseases has been historically based on conventional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks and Decision Trees. However, the prevailing approach has shifted to the application of deep learning concepts, with focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In general, this kind of technique requires large datasets containing a wide variety of conditions to work properly. This is an important limitation, given the many challenges involved in the construction of a suitable image database. In this context, this study investigates how the size and variety of the datasets impact the effectiveness of deep learning techniques applied to plant pathology. This investigation was based on an image database containing 12 plant species, each presenting very different characteristics in terms of number of samples, number of diseases and variety of conditions. Experimental results indicate that while the technical constraints linked to automatic plant disease classification have been largely overcome, the use of limited image datasets for training brings many undesirable consequences that still prevent the effective dissemination of this type of technology.

Owing to the ever-growing availability of free data and software, remote sensing (RS) techniques have been primarily used to map, analyse, and monitor natural resources for conservation purposes. The need to adopt multi-scale and multi-temporal approaches to detect different phenological aspects of different vegetation types and species has also emerged. The time-series composite image approach allows for capturing much of the spectral variability, but presents some criticalities (e.g., time-consuming research, downloading data, and the required storage space). To overcome these issues, the Google Earth engine (GEE) has been proposed, a free cloud-based computational platform that allows users to access and process remotely sensed data at petabyte scales. The application was tested in a natural protected area in Calabria (South Italy), which is particularly representative of the Mediterranean mountain forest environment. In the research, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were used to perform supervised pixel-based classification based on the use of Sentinel-2 images. A process to select the best input image (seasonal composition strategies, statistical operators, band composition, and derived vegetation indices (VIs) information) for classification was implemented. A set of accuracy indicators, including overall accuracy (OA) and multi-class F-score (F-m), were computed to assess the results of the different classifications. GEE proved to be a reliable and powerful tool for the classification process. The best results (OA = 0.88 and F-m = 0.88) were achieved using RF with the summer image composite, adding three VIs (NDVI, EVI, and NBR) to the Sentinel-2 bands. SVM and RF produced OAs of 0.83 and 0.80, respectively.

These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods.

Standardization of visual assessments and deployment of imaging techniques have improved the accuracy and reliability of stress assessment in comparison with unaided visual measurement. The growing capabilities of machine learning (ML) methods in conjunction with image-based phenotyping can extract new insights from curated, annotated, and high-dimensional datasets across varied crops and stresses. We propose an overarching strategy for utilizing ML techniques that methodically enables the application of plant stress phenotyping at multiple scales across different types of stresses, program goals, and environments.

Past research has been focused on centralized algorithms, which assume the existence of a central data repository (database) which stores and can process the data from all participants. Such an architecture, however, can be impractical when data are not centrally located, it does not scale well to very large datasets, and introduces single-point of failure risks which could compromise the integrity and privacy of the data. Given scores of data widely spread across hospitals/individuals, a decentralized computationally scalable methodology is very much in need. Objective: We aim at solving a binary supervised classification problem to predict hospitalizations for cardiac events using a distributed algorithm. We seek to develop a general decentralized optimization framework enabling multiple data holders to collaborate and converge to a common predictive model, without explicitly exchanging raw data. Methods: We focus on the soft-margin l(1)-regularized sparse Support Vector Machine (sSVM) classifier. We develop an iterative cluster Primal Dual Splitting (cPDS) algorithm for solving the large-scale sSVM problem in a decentralized fashion. Such a distributed learning scheme is relevant for multi-institutional collaborations or peer-to-peer applications, allowing the data holders to collaborate, while keeping every participant's data private. Results: We test cPDS on the problem of predicting hospitalizations due to heart diseases within a calendar year based on information in the patients Electronic Health Records prior to that year. cPDS converges faster than centralized methods at the cost of some communication between agents. It also converges faster and with less communication overhead compared to an alternative distributed algorithm. In both cases, it achieves similar prediction accuracy measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of the classifier. We extract important features discovered by the algorithm that are predictive of future hospitalizations, thus providing a way to interpret the classification results and inform prevention efforts.

For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.

Such models can be nowadays deployed on large patient-specific topologies of systemic arterial networks and return detailed predictions on flow patterns, wall shear stresses, and pulse wave propagation. However, their success heavily relies on tedious pre-processing and calibration procedures that typically induce a significant computational cost, thus hampering their clinical applicability. In this work we put forth a machine learning framework that enables the seamless synthesis of non-invasive in-vivo measurement techniques and computational flow dynamics models derived from first physical principles. We illustrate this new paradigm by showing how one-dimensional models of pulsatile flow can be used to constrain the output of deep neural networks such that their predictions satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum principles. Once trained on noisy and scattered clinical data of flow and wall displacement, these networks can return physically consistent predictions for velocity, pressure and wall displacement pulse wave propagation, all without the need to employ conventional simulators. A simple post-processing of these outputs can also provide a relatively cheap and effective way for estimating Windkessel model parameters that are required for the calibration of traditional computational models. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a series of prototype benchmarks, as well as a realistic clinical case involving in-vivo measurements near the aorta/carotid bifurcation of a healthy human subject.

J	Fan, JL; Wu, LF; Ma, X; Zhou, HM; Zhang, FC				Fan, Junliang; Wu, Lifeng; Ma, Xin; Zhou, Hanmi; Zhang, Fucang			Hybrid support vector machines with heuristic algorithms for prediction of daily diffuse solar radiation in air-polluted regions	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Air pollution; Support vector machines; Extreme gradient boosting; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Bat algorithm; Whale optimization algorithm	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EMPIRICAL-MODELS; SUNSHINE DURATION; HORIZONTAL DIFFUSE; REGRESSION; IRRADIANCE; PERFORMANCE; INDEX; FOG; OPTIMIZATION	Increasing air pollutants significantly affect the proportion of diffuse (R-d) to global (R-s) solar radiation. This study proposed three new hybrid support vector machines (SVM) with particle swarm optimization algorithm (SVM-PSO), bat algorithm (SVM-BAT) and whale optimization algorithm (SVM-WOA) for predicting daily R-d in air-polluted regions. These models were further compared to standalone SVM, multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. The results showed that models with suspended particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m and 10 mu m (PM2.5 and PM10) and ozone (O-3) produced more accurate daily R-d estimates than those without air pollution parameters, with average relative decreases in root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 11.1%, 10.0% and 10.4% for sunshine duration-based, R-s-based and combined models, respectively. SVM showed better accuracy than XGBoost and MARS. However, compared to SVM, SVM-BAT further enhanced the prediction accuracy and convergence rate in daily R-d modeling, followed by SVM-WOA and SVM-PSO, with relative decreases in RMSD of 2.9%-5.6%, 1.9%-4.9% and 1.1%-3.3%, respectively. The results highlighted the significance of incorporating air pollutants for more accurate estimation of daily R-d in air-polluted regions. Heuristic algorithms, especially BAT, are highly recommended for improving performance of standalone machine learning models. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We aimed at identifying baseline characteristics predisposing COVID-19 patients to in-hospital death. Methods and results: Retrospective observational study on 3894 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized from February 19th to May 23rd, 2020 and recruited in 30 clinical centres distributed throughout Italy. Machine learning (random forest)-based and Cox survival analysis. 61.7% of participants were men (median age 67 years), followed up for a median of 13 days. In-hospital mortality exhibited a geographical gradient, Northern Italian regions featuring more than twofold higher death rates as compared to Central/Southern areas (15.6% vs 6.4%, respectively). Machine learning analysis revealed that the most important features in death classification were impaired renal function, elevated C reactive protein and advanced age. These findings were confirmed by multivariable Cox survival analysis (hazard ratio (HR): 8.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6-14.7 for age >= 85 vs 18 -44 y); HR = 4.7; 2.9-7.7 for estimated glomerular filtration rate levels <15 vs >= 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2); HR = 2.3; 1.5-3.6 for C-reactive protein levels >= 10 vs <= 3mg/L). No relation was found with obesity, tobacco use, cardiovascular disease and related-comorbidities. The associations between these variables and mortality were substantially homogenous across all sub-groups analyses. Conclusions: Impaired renal function, elevated C-reactive protein and advanced age were major predictors of in-hospital death in a large cohort of unselected patients with COVID-19, admitted to 30 different clinical centres all over Italy.

Predicting cancer outcomes from histology and genomics using convolutional networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						artificial intelligence; machine learning; digital pathology; deep learning; cancer	BRAIN-TUMOR SEGMENTATION; DIGITAL SLIDE ARCHIVE; CLASSIFICATION; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY; PROGNOSIS; PROSTATE; SURVIVAL; NUCLEI; ATRX	Cancer histology reflects underlying molecular processes and disease progression and contains rich phenotypic information that is predictive of patient outcomes. In this study, we show a computational approach for learning patient outcomes from digital pathology images using deep learning to combine the power of adaptive machine learning algorithms with traditional survival models. We illustrate how these survival convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) can integrate information from both histology images and genomic biomarkers into a single unified framework to predict time-to-event outcomes and show prediction accuracy that surpasses the current clinical paradigm for predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with glioma. We use statistical sampling techniques to address challenges in learning survival from histology images, including tumor heterogeneity and the need for large training cohorts. We also provide insights into the prediction mechanisms of SCNNs, using heat map visualization to show that SCNNs recognize important structures, like microvascular proliferation, that are related to prognosis and that are used by pathologists in grading. These results highlight the emerging role of deep learning in precision medicine and suggest an expanding utility for computational analysis of histology in the future practice of pathology.

The reservoir area formed by the world's largest hydropower project, Three Gorges Hydropower project of China, has become a natural testing ground for landslide prediction in the hope of reducing losses. In this paper, a new algorithm with strong optimization ability, the water cycle algorithm (WCA), is combined with the extreme learning machine (ELM) to improve the prediction accuracy of step-wise landslide. The gray relational grade analysis method was adopted to determine the main influencing factors of the landslide's periodic displacement. Then, the determined factors were used as the input items of the proposed WCA-ELM model, and the corresponding periodic displacement was used as the model output item. Taking the Liujiabao landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir area as a case history, the proposed model was verified through a comparison with the measurements. The results showed that the model has a faster convergence rate and higher prediction accuracy than the traditional back-propagation neural network model and ELM-model. The water cycle algorithm is suitable for optimizing the accuracy of the extreme learning machine model in landslide prediction.

Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress of image super-resolution using deep learning techniques. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on recent advances of image super-resolution using deep learning approaches. In general, we can roughly group the existing studies of SR techniques into three major categories: supervised SR, unsupervised SR, and domain-specific SR. In addition, we also cover some other important issues, such as publicly available benchmark datasets and performance evaluation metrics. Finally, we conclude this survey by highlighting several future directions and open issues which should be further addressed by the community in the future.

The DeepCoin framework uses two schemes, a blockchain-based scheme and a deep learning-based scheme. The blockchain-based scheme consists of five phases: setup phase, agreement phase, creating a block phase and consensus-making phase, and view change phase. It incorporates a novel reliable peer-to-peer energy system that is based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm and it achieves high throughput. In order to prevent smart grid attacks, the proposed framework makes the generation of blocks using short signatures and hash functions. The proposed deep learning-based scheme is an intrusion detection system (IDS), which employs recurrent neural networks for detecting network attacks and fraudulent transactions in the blockchain-based energy network. We study the performance of the proposed IDS on three different sources the CICIDS2017 dataset, a power system dataset, and a web robot (Bot)-Internet of Things (IoT) dataset.

Joshua			Reinforcement learning with analogue memristor arrays	NATURE ELECTRONICS			English	Article							DEVICE; SYNAPSE; MEMORY; PLASTICITY	Reinforcement learning algorithms that use deep neural networks are a promising approach for the development of machines that can acquire knowledge and solve problems without human input or supervision. At present, however, these algorithms are implemented in software running on relatively standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor digital platforms, where performance will be constrained by the limits of Moore's law and von Neumann architecture. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of reinforcement learning on a three-layer 1-transistor 1-memristor (1T1R) network using a modified learning algorithm tailored for our hybrid analogue-digital platform. To illustrate the capabilities of our approach in robust in situ training without the need for a model, we performed two classic control problems: the cart-pole and mountain car simulations. We also show that, compared with conventional digital systems in real-world reinforcement learning tasks, our hybrid analogue-digital computing system has the potential to achieve a significant boost in speed and energy efficiency.

Meanwhile, with this revolutionary transformation, researchers, implementers, deployers, and users are faced with many challenges. IoT is a complicated, crowded, and complex field; there are various types of devices, protocols, communication channels, architectures, middleware, and more. Standardization efforts are plenty, and this chaos will continue for quite some time. What is clear, on the other hand, is that IoT deployments are increasing with accelerating speed, and this trend will not stop in the near future. As the field grows in numbers and heterogeneity, "intelligence" becomes a focal point in IoT. Since data now becomes "big data," understanding, learning, and reasoning with big data is paramount for the future success of IoT. One of the major problems in the path to intelligent IoT is understanding "context," or making sense of the environment, situation, or status using data from sensors, and then acting accordingly in autonomous ways. This is called "context-aware computing," and it now requires both sensing and, increasingly, learning, as IoT systems get more data and better learning from this big data. In this survey, we review the field, first, from a historical perspective, covering ubiquitous and pervasive computing, ambient intelligence, and wireless sensor networks, and then, move to context-aware computing studies. Finally, we review learning and big data studies related to IoT. We also identify the open issues and provide an insight for future study areas for IoT researchers.

Compressive strength can vary with the composition and proportion of constituent material used. To predict the strength of such a complex matrix the use of robust and efficient machine learning approaches has become indispensable. This study uses machine intelligence algorithms with individual learners and ensemble learners (bagging, boosting) to predict the strength of (HPC) prepared with waste materials. This is done by employing Anaconda (Python). Ensemble learner bagging, adaptive boosting algorithm, and random forest as modified bagging algorithm are employed to construct strong ensemble learner by incorporating weak learner. The ensemble learners are used on individual learners or weak learners including support vector machine and decision tree through regression and multilayer perceptron neural network. The data consists of 1030 data samples in which eight parameters namely cement, water, sand, gravels, superplasticizer, concrete age, fly ash and granulated blast furnace slag were chosen to predict the output. Twenty bagging and boosting sub-models are trained on data and optimization was done to give maximum R-2. The test data is also validated by means of K-Fold cross validation using R-2, MAE, and RMSE. Moreover, evaluation of ensemble models with individual one is also checked by statistical model performance index (e.g., MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RMLSE). The result suggested that the individual model response is enhanced by using the bagging and boosting learners. Overall, random forest and decision tree with bagging give the robust performance of the models with R-2 = 0.92 with the least errors. On average, the ensemble model in machine learning would enhance the performance of the model. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: Chances and Challenges	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						decision-making; diagnostic systems; informatics; dental; deep learning; machine learning		The term "artificial intelligence" (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which "learns" intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute ("explainable AI"). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.

Due to the huge amount of reviews, sentiment analysis plays a basic role to extract significant information and overall sentiment orientation of reviews. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based method to classify a user's opinion expressed in reviews (called RNSA). To the best of our knowledge, a deep learning-based method in which a unified feature set which is representative of word embedding, sentiment knowledge, sentiment shifter rules, statistical and linguistic knowledge, has not been thoroughly studied for a sentiment analysis. The RNSA employs the Recurrent Neural Network (FINN) which is composed by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to take advantage of sequential processing and overcome several flaws in traditional methods, where order and information about the word are vanished. Furthermore, it uses sentiment knowledge, sentiment shifter rules and multiple strategies to overcome the following drawbacks: words with similar semantic context but opposite sentiment polarity; contextual polarity; sentence types; word coverage limit of an individual lexicon; word sense variations. To verify the effectiveness of our work, we conduct sentence-level sentiment classification on large-scale review datasets. We obtained encouraging result. Experimental results show that (1) feature vectors in terms of (a) statistical, linguistic and sentiment knowledge, (b) sentiment shifter rules and (c) word-embedding can improve the classification accuracy of sentence-level sentiment analysis; (2) our method that learns from this unified feature set can obtain significant performance than one that learns from a feature subset; (3) our neural model yields superior performance improvements in comparison with other well-known approaches in the literature.

In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to "discover" despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.

Recent advances in data-driven machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning (DL), show great potential to address the challenges. However, waveforms in the physical layer may not be suitable for the prevalent classical DL models, such as convolution neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), which mainly accept formats of images, time series, and text data in the application layer. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to bridge the gap between signal waveforms to DL amenable data formats. In this article, we develop a framework to transform complex-valued signal waveforms into images with statistical significance, termed contour stellar image (CSI), which can convey deep level statistical information from the raw wireless signal waveforms while being represented in an image data format. In this article, we explore several potential application scenarios and present effective CSI-based solutions to address the signal recognition challenges. Our investigation validates that CSI is a promising method to bridge the gap between signal recognition and DL.

J	Zhang, ZH; He, Q; Gao, J; Ni, M				Zhang, Zhenhua; He, Qing; Gao, Jing; Ni, Ming			A deep learning approach for detecting traffic accidents from social media data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic accident detection; Tweet; Social media; Association rules; Deep learning	REAL-TIME DETECTION; TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; TWITTER; ALGORITHM; TRANSIT	This paper employs deep learning in detecting the traffic accident from social media data. First, we thoroughly investigate the 1-year over 3 million tweet contents in two metropolitan areas: Northern Virginia and New York City. Our results show that paired tokens can capture the association rules inherent in the accident-related tweets and further increase the accuracy of the traffic accident detection. Second, two deep learning methods: Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated and implemented on the extracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracy of 85% with about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. The classification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and supervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA). Finally, to validate this study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the traffic accident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loop detectors. It is found that nearly 66% of the accident-related tweets can be located by the accident log and more than 80% of them can be tied to nearby abnormal traffic data. Several important issues of using Twitter to detect traffic accidents have been brought up by the comparison including the location and time bias, as well as the characteristics of influential users and hashtags.

A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery	CELL			English	Article							OUTER-MEMBRANE; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; MECHANISM; PERMEABILITY; GENERATION; PREDICTION; DATABASES; LIBRARY; FORCE	Due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, there is a growing need to discover new antibiotics. To address this challenge, we trained a deep neural network capable of predicting molecules with antibacterial activity. We performed predictions on multiple chemical libraries and discovered a molecule from the Drug Repurposing Hub-halicin-that is structurally divergent from conventional antibiotics and displays bactericidal activity against a wide phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Halicin also effectively treated Clostridioides difficile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in murine models. Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested predictions from >107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our model identified eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from known antibiotics. This work highlights the utility of deep learning approaches to expand our antibiotic arsenal through the discovery of structurally distinct antibacterial molecules.

J	Gu, K; Tao, DC; Qiao, JF; Lin, WS				Gu, Ke; Tao, Dacheng; Qiao, Jun-Fei; Lin, Weisi			Learning a No-Reference Quality Assessment Model of Enhanced Images With Big Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Big data learning; enhancement; image quality assessment (IQA); no-reference (NR)/blind	STATISTICS; SCENE; PHASE	In this paper, we investigate into the problem of image quality assessment (IQA) and enhancement via machine learning. This issue has long attracted a wide range of attention in computational intelligence and image processing communities, since, for many practical applications, e.g., object detection and recognition, raw images are usually needed to be appropriately enhanced to raise the visual quality (e.g., visibility and contrast). In fact, proper enhancement can noticeably improve the quality of input images, even better than originally captured images, which are generally thought to be of the best quality. In this paper, we present two most important contributions. The first contribution is to develop a new no-reference (NR) IQA model. Given an image, our quality measure first extracts 17 features through analysis of contrast, sharpness, brightness and more, and then yields a measure of visual quality using a regression module, which is learned with big-data training samples that are much bigger than the size of relevant image data sets. The results of experiments on nine data sets validate the superiority and efficiency of our blind metric compared with typical state-of-the-art full-reference, reduced-reference and NA IQA methods. The second contribution is that a robust image enhancement framework is established based on quality optimization. For an input image, by the guidance of the proposed NR-IQA measure, we conduct histogram modification to successively rectify image brightness and contrast to a proper level. Thorough tests demonstrate that our framework can well enhance natural images, low-contrast images, low-light images, and dehazed images.

To better guarantee quality-of-service, it has become necessary to cooperate multiple edges instead of letting them work alone. However, the existing solutions commonly use a centralized decision-making manner and cannot effectively achieve good load balancing among massive edges that are widely distributed in IIoT environments. This results in long decision-making time and high communication costs. To address this important problem, in this article, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-empowered feedback control method for cooperative load balancing (RF-CLB). First, by integrating RL and machine learning (ML) algorithms, each edge independently schedules tasks and performs load balancing between adjacent edges based on the local information. Next, through feedback control and multiedge cooperation, the objective multiedge load-balancing plan for IIoT can be found. Simulation results demonstrate that the RF-CLB chooses the adjustment operations of load balancing with 96.3% correctness. Moreover, the RF-CLB achieves the near-optimal performance, which outperforms the classic ML-based and rule-based methods by 6-9% and 10-12%, respectively.

However, the real industrial process data are much more complex which is characterized by multimode, high dimensional, corrupted, and less labeled data. In order to eliminate these unfavourable factors simultaneously, a semisupervised robust projective and discriminative dictionary learning method is proposed. First, a semisupervised strategy is introduced to label unsupervised training data. Then, by utilizing low-rank and sparse features of raw data and outliers, a robust decomposition method is used to obtain clean data. After that, a simultaneously projective and discriminative model is proposed to extracting the feature of the low-rank clean data. Finally, the projection matrix and global dictionary, as well as the threshold are obtained through iterative dictionary learning. This hybrid framework provides a robust model for process monitoring and mode identification, and its efficiency is demonstrated by both synthetic examples and real industrial process cases.

However, issues such as vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud are still widespread in vaccine supply chains. Therefore, an effective management system for the supervision of vaccine supply chains is urgently required. As the next generation of core technology after the Internet, blockchain is designed to build trust mechanisms that can change current information management methods. Meanwhile, the development of machine learning technologies provides additional ways to analyze the data in information management systems. The main objective of this study is to develop a "vaccine blockchain" system based on blockchain and machine learning technologies. This vaccine blockchain system is designed to support vaccine traceability and smart contract functions, and can be used to address the problems of vaccine expiration and vaccine record fraud. Additionally, the use of machine learning models can provide valuable recommendations to immunization practitioners and recipients, allowing them to choose better immunization methods and vaccines.

In federated learning, training data is widely distributed and maintained on the mobile devices as workers. A central aggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile devices using their local training data to train the global model in each iteration. However, unreliable data may be uploaded by the mobile devices (i.e., workers), leading to frauds in tasks of federated learning. The workers may perform unreliable updates intentionally, for example, the data poisoning attack, or unintentionally, for example, low-quality data caused by energy constraints or high-speed mobility. Therefore, finding out trusted and reliable workers in federated learning tasks becomes critical. In this article, the concept of reputation is introduced as a metric. Based on this metric, a reliable worker selection scheme is proposed for federated learning tasks.

To solve this issue, this study proposes a feature distance stack autoencoder (FD-SAE) for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing methods, FD-SAE has stronger feature extraction ability and faster network convergence speed. By analyzing the characteristics of original rolling bearing data, it is found that there are evident differences between normal data and faulty data. Therefore, a simple linear support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify normal data and faulty data, and then the proposed FD-SAE is used for fault classification. The novel combination of SVM and FD-SAE has simple structure and little computational complexity. Finally, the proposed method is verified on the rolling bearing data set of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).

Set-based methods used to estimate reachable sets typically do not scale well with the state-space dimension, or rely heavily on the existence of a model. If such a model is not available, it is simple to generate state trajectory data by numerically simulating black-box oracles of systems (whose dynamics are unknown) from sampled initial conditions. Using these data samples, the estimation of reachable sets can be posed as a classification problem, wherein AL can intelligently select samples that are most informative and least similar to previously labeled samples. By exploiting submodularity, the actively learned samples can be selected efficiently, with bounded suboptimality. Our proposed framework is illustrated by estimating the domains of attractions of model predictive controllers (MPCs) and reinforcement learners. We also consider a scenario where there are two oracles that differ with respect to evaluation costs and labeling accuracy. We propose a framework to reduce the dependency of the expensive oracle in labeling samples using disagreement-based AL (DBAL). The potential of the DBAL algorithm is demonstrated on a solver selection problem for real-time MPC.

Usually, this virus spreads in humans through aerial precipitation of any fluid secreted from the infected entity's body part. This type of virus is fatal than other unpremeditated viruses. Meanwhile, another class of coronavirus was developed in December 2019, named Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), first seen in Wuhan, China. From January 23, 2020, the number of affected individuals from this virus rapidly increased in Wuhan and other countries. This research proposes a system for classifying and analyzing the predictions obtained from symptoms of this virus. The proposed system aims to determine those attributes that help in the early detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This work computes the accuracy of different machine learning classifiers and selects the best classifier for COVID-19 detection based on comparative analysis. ANFIS is used to model and control ill-defined and uncertain systems to predict this globally spread disease's risk factor. COVID-19 dataset is classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) because it achieved the highest accuracy of 100% among all classifiers. Furthermore, the ANFIS model is implemented on this classified dataset, which results in an 80% risk prediction for COVID-19.

However, the BioSeq-Analysis can be only applied to the sequence-level analysis tasks, preventing its applications to the residue-level analysis tasks, and an intelligent tool that is able to automatically generate various predictors for biological sequence analysis at both residue level and sequence level is highly desired. In this regard, we decided to publish an important updated server covering a total of 26 features at the residue level and 90 features at the sequence level called BioSeq-Analysis2.0 (http://bliulab.net/BioSeq-Analysis2.0/), by which the users only need to upload the benchmark dataset, and the BioSeq-Analysis2.0 can generate the predictors for both residue-level analysis and sequence-level analysis tasks. Furthermore, the corresponding stand-alone tool was also provided, which can be downloaded from http://bliulab.net/BioSeq-Analysis2.0/download/. To the best of our knowledge, the BioSeq-Analysis2.0 is the first tool for generating predictors for biological sequence analysis tasks at residue level. Specifically, the experimental results indicated that the predictors developed by BioSeq-Analysis2.0 can achieve comparable or even better performance than the existing state-of-the-art predictors.

Polymer informatics is one such domain where AI and machine learning (ML) tools are being used in the efficient development, design and discovery of polymers. Surrogate models are trained on available polymer data for instant property prediction, allowing screening of promising polymer candidates with specific target property requirements. Questions regarding synthesizability, and potential (retro)synthesis steps to create a target polymer, are being explored using statistical means. Data-driven strategies to tackle unique challenges resulting from the extraordinary chemical and physical diversity of polymers at small and large scales are being explored. Other major hurdles for polymer informatics are the lack of widespread availability of curated and organized data, and approaches to create machine-readable representations that capture not just the structure of complex polymeric situations but also synthesis and processing conditions. Methods to solve inverse problems, wherein polymer recommendations are made using advanced AI algorithms that meet application targets, are being investigated. As various parts of the burgeoning polymer informatics ecosystem mature and become integrated, efficiency improvements, accelerated discoveries and increased productivity can result. Here, we review emergent components of this polymer informatics ecosystem and discuss imminent challenges and opportunities.

In this article, a kind of flat neural networks called the broad learning system (BLS) is employed to derive two novel learning methods for text classification, including recurrent BLS (R-BLS) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-like architecture: gated BLS (G-BLS). The proposed two methods possess three advantages: 1) higher accuracy due to the simultaneous learning of multiple information, even compared to deep LSTM that extracts deeper but single information only; 2) significantly faster training time due to the noniterative learning in BLS, compared to LSTM; and 3) easy integration with other discriminant information for further improvement. The proposed methods have been evaluated over 13 real-world datasets from various types of text classification. From the experimental results, the proposed methods achieve higher accuracies than LSTM while taking significantly less training time on most evaluated datasets, especially when the LSTM is in deep architecture. Compared to R-BLS, G-BLS has an extra forget gate to control the flow of information (similar to LSTM) to further improve the accuracy on text classification so that G-BLS is more effective while R-BLS is more efficient.

Methods Our retrospective study included 46 patients seen between December 2017 and April 2018. A radiologist recorded the standard deviation of attenuation in the paraspinal muscle as the image noise and calculated the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the aorta, portal vein, and liver. The overall image quality was assessed by two other radiologists and graded on a 5-point confidence scale ranging from 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (excellent). The difference between CT images subjected to hybrid-IR, MBIR, and DLR was compared. Results The image noise was significantly lower and the CNR was significantly higher on DLR than hybrid-IR and MBIR images (p < 0.01). DLR images received the highest and MBIR images the lowest scores for overall image quality. Conclusions DLR improved the quality of abdominal U-HRCT images.

The national emphasis on this field has also gradually improved. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is an innovative mode of borrowing that is a powerful complement to the traditional financial industry. The projected default rate on credit is an absolute prerequisite for guaranteeing the proper operation of related financial projects or platforms. In this paper, we use `multiobservation' and 'multi-dimensional' data cleaning method and apply the modern machine learning algorithms LightGBM in Asia at the end of 2016 and XGboost, which are based on real P2P transaction data from Lending club. The default risk of loans in the platform is strongly and innovatively predicted. And the results of different methods are compared. Furthermore, we observe that the LightGBM algorithm based on multiple observational data set classification prediction results is the best. The average performance rate of the historical transaction data of the Lending Club platform rose by 1.28 percentage points, which reduced loan defaults by approximately $117 million. Finally, with respect to the influencing factors of the default rate, suggested developments for the Lending club and other P2P platforms are provided as is the suggested direction of other countries' development in this field.

Therefore, boosting the capabilities of methods of predicting bug report severity is critically important for determining the priority of fixing bugs. However, typical classification techniques may be adversely affected when the severity distribution of the bug reports is imbalanced, leading to performance degradation in a crowdsourcing environment. In this study, we propose an enhanced oversampling approach called CR-SMOTE to enhance the classification of bug reports with a realistically imbalanced severity distribution. The main idea is to interpolate new instances into the minority category that are near the center of existing samples in that category. Then, we use an extreme learning machine (ELM) - a feedforward neural network with a single layer of hidden nodes - to predict the bug severity. Several experiments were conducted on three datasets from real bug repositories, and the results statistically indicate that the presented approach is robust against real data imbalance when predicting the severity of bug reports. The average accuracies achieved by the ELM in predicting the severity of Eclipse, Mozilla, and GNOME bug reports were 0.780, 0.871, and 0.861, which are higher than those of classifiers by 4.36%, 6.73%, and 2.71%, respectively.

In recent years, in order to deal with these deficiencies, our urban transport systems have been transforming with the blossom of key vehicle technology innovations, most notably, connected and automated vehicles. In this paper, we develop a car following model for electric, connected and automated vehicles based on reinforcement learning with the aim to dampen traffic oscillations (stop-and-go traffic waves) caused by human drivers and improve electric energy consumption. Compared to classical modelling approaches, the proposed reinforcement learning based model significantly reduces the modelling constraints and has the capability of self-learning and self-correction. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to improve travel efficiency by reducing the negative impact of traffic oscillations, and it can also reduce the average electric energy consumption.

In this paper, a novel nonlinear hybrid model aiming at improving prediction performance of wind speed called LSTMDE-HELM is presented by using Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), Hysteretic Extreme Learning Machine (HELM), Differential Evolution algorithm (DE), and nonlinear combined mechanism. First, to enhance the performance of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a biological neural system property called hysteresis is embedded into neuron activation function of ELM. Second, as there isn't a clear knowledge to set the number of hidden layers in LSTM and neurons count in each hidden layer, DE is introduced to optimize these numbers by minimizing a weighted objective function for keeping balance between learning performance and model complexity. Finally, the forecasting results of each predictor in LSTMDE-HELM are aggregated by a novel nonlinear combined mechanism composed of LSTM network and also the DE is used to optimize this LSTM. The proposed nonlinear hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China. Two forecasting horizons i.e., ten-minute ahead (utmost short term) and one-hour ahead (short term) are adopted for experiments. Empirical results fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid model compared with other models in terms of four performance indices and statistical tests.

Vincent			Scheduling Policies for Federated Learning in Wireless Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Convergence; Data models; Signal to noise ratio; Interference; Computational modeling; Training; Wireless networks; Federated learning; scheduling policies; parallel and distributed algorithms; stochastic geometry; convergence analysis		Motivated by the increasing computational capacity of wireless user equipments (UEs), e.g., smart phones, tablets, or vehicles, as well as the increasing concerns about sharing private data, a new machine learning model has emerged, namely federated learning (FL), that allows a decoupling of data acquisition and computation at the central unit. Unlike centralized learning taking place in a data center, FL usually operates in a wireless edge network where the communication medium is resource-constrained and unreliable. Due to limited bandwidth, only a portion of UEs can be scheduled for updates at each iteration. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, transmissions are subjected to interference and are not guaranteed. The performance of FL system in such a setting is not well understood. In this paper, an analytical model is developed to characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks. Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FL in a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling schemes and inter-cell interference. Using the developed analysis, the effectiveness of three different scheduling policies, i.e., random scheduling (RS), round robin (RR), and proportional fair (PF), are compared in terms of FL convergence rate. It is shown that running FL with PF outperforms RS and RR if the network is operating under a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold, while RR is more preferable when the SINR threshold is low. Moreover, the FL convergence rate decreases rapidly as the SINR threshold increases, thus confirming the importance of compression and quantization of the update parameters. The analysis also reveals a trade-off between the number of scheduled UEs and subchannel bandwidth under a fixed amount of available spectrum.	[Yang, Howard H.; Quek, Tony Q.

However, most deep networks mainly focus on hierarchical feature learning for the raw observed input data. For soft sensor applications, it is important to reduce irrelevant information and extract quality-relevant features from the raw input data for quality prediction. To deal with this problem, a novel deep learning network is proposed for quality-relevant feature representation in this article, which is based on stacked quality-driven autoencoder (SQAE). First, a quality-driven autoencoder (QAE) is designed by exploiting the quality data to guide feature extraction with the constraint that the potential features should largely reconstruct the input layer data and the quality data at the output layer. In this way, quality-relevant features can be captured by QAE. Then, by stacking multiple QAEs to construct the deep SQAE network, SQAE can gradually reduce irrelevant features and learn hierarchical quality-relevant features. Finally, the high-level quality-relevant features can be directly applied for soft sensing of the quality variables. The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed deep learning model are validated on an industrial debutanizer column process.

J	Xu, CC; Ji, JY; Liu, P				Xu, Chengcheng; Ji, Junyi; Liu, Pan			The station-free sharing bike demand forecasting with a deep learning approach and large-scale datasets	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Sharing mobility; Station-free bike sharing; Travel demand forecasting; Bike sharing; Deep learning; Long short-term memory networks; Big data	TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; RIDE SERVICES; NETWORKS; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	The station-free sharing bike is a new sharing traffic mode that has been deployed in a large scale in China in the early 2017. Without docking stations, this system allows the sharing bike to be parked in any proper places. This study aimed to develop a dynamic demand forecasting model for station-free bike sharing using the deep learning approach. The spatial and temporal analyses were first conducted to investigate the mobility pattern of the station-free bike sharing. The result indicates the imbalanced spatial and temporal demand of bike sharing trips. The long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM NNs) were then developed to predict the bike sharing trip production and attraction at TAZ for different time intervals, including the 10-min, 15-min, 20-min and 30-min intervals. The validation results suggested that the developed LSTM NNs have reasonable good prediction accuracy in trip productions and attractions for different time intervals. The statistical models and recently developed machine learning methods were also developed to benchmark the LSTM NN. The comparison results suggested that the LSTM NNs provide better prediction accuracy than both conventional statistical models and advanced machine learning methods for different time intervals. The developed LSTM NNs can be used to predict the gap between the inflow and outflow of the sharing bike trips at a TAZ, which provide useful information for rebalancing the sharing bike in the system.

Successful adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) created an explosion in digital clinical data available for analysis, but progress in machine learning for healthcare research has been difficult to measure because of the absence of publicly available benchmark data sets. To address this problem, we propose four clinical prediction benchmarks using data derived from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling risk of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline, and phenotype classification. We propose strong linear and neural baselines for all four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training and data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural models.

Therefore, the identification of potential groundwater zones is an important tool for groundwater occurrence, protection, and management purposes. More specifically, in arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater is one of the most important natural resources as it supplies water during the drought period. The present research study focused on the delineation of potential groundwater zones in Saveh City, the northern part of the Markazi Province in Iran. The groundwater potential mapping was prepared using hybrid deep learning and machine learning algorithm of the boosted tree (BT), artificial neural network (ANN), deep learning neural network (DLNN), deep learning tree (DLT), and deep boosting (DB). This study was carried out by using fourteen groundwater potential conditioning factors and 349 each for springs and non-springs points. The performance of each model was validated through statistical analysis of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under curve (AUC) analysis. The validation result showed that the success rate of AUC is very good for the DB model (0.87-0.99) and other models are also good i.e. BT (0.81-0.90), ANN (0.77-0.82), DLNN (0.84-0.86), and DLT (0.83-0.91). Among the several factors used in this study altitude, rainfall, distance to fault and soil types are the more important conditioning factors for groundwater potential modeling. Finally, all the models in this study had high efficiency in groundwater potential mapping, but it is recommended to use the Deep Boost model due to the better results in future studies. The result of this work will be useful to planners for optimal use and future planning of groundwater.

Here, systematic density functional theory computations reveal that the edge sites-zigzag and armchair-are responsible for the activity of the graphene-based Co (cobalt) SACs toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Then, edge-rich (E)-Co single atoms (SAs) were rationally synthesized guided by theoretical results. Supervised learning techniques are applied to interpret the measured synchrotron spectrum of E-Co SAs. The obtained local environments of Co SAs, 65.49% of Co-4N-plane, 13.64% in Co-2N-armchair, and 20.86% in Co-2N-zigzag, are consistent with Athena fitting. Remarkably, E-Co SAs show even better HER electrocatalytic performance than commercial Pt/C at high current density. Using the joint effort of theoretical modeling, thorough characterization of the catalysts aided by supervised learning, and catalytic performance evaluations, this study not only uncovers the activity origin of Co SACs for HER but also lays the cornerstone for the rational design and structural analysis of nanocatalysts.

J	Barzegar, R; Aalami, MT; Adamowski, J				Barzegar, Rahim; Aalami, Mohammad Taghi; Adamowski, Jan			Short-term water quality variable prediction using a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Long short-term memory; Convolutional neural network; Water quality modeling; Deep learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; RANDOM FOREST; IMPLEMENTATION; PARAMETERS; FORECASTS; CLIMATE; DESIGN; MEMORY	Water quality monitoring is an important component of water resources management. In order to predict two water quality variables, namely dissolved oxygen (DO; mg/L) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a; mu g/L) in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece, two standalone deep learning (DL) models, the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, along with their hybrid, the CNN-LSTM model, were developed. The main novelty of this study was to build a coupled CNN-LSTM model to predict water quality variables. Two traditional machine learning models, support-vector regression (SVR) and decision tree (DT), were also developed to compare with the DL models. Time series of the physicochemical water quality variables, specifically pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP; mV), water temperature (degrees C), electrical conductivity (EC; mu S/cm), DO and Chl-a, were obtained using a sensor at 15-min intervals from June 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013 for model development. Lag times of up to one (t - 1) and two (t - 2) for input variables pH, ORP, water temperature, and EC were used to predict DO and Chl-a concentrations, respectively. Each model's performance in both training and testing phases was assessed using statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents (RRMSE, RMAE; %), percentage of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient Willmott's Index, and graphical plots (Taylor diagram, box plot and spider diagram). Results showed that LSTM outperformed the CNN model for DO prediction, but the standalone DL models yielded similar performances for Chl-a prediction. Generally, the hybrid CNN-LSTM models outperformed the standalone models (LSTM, CNN, SVR and DT models) in predicting both DO and Chl-a. By integrating the LSTM and CNN models, the hybrid model successfully captured both the low and high levels of the water quality variables, particularly for the DO concentrations.

With the development of hardware and software, industrial processes have embraced new characteristics, which lead to the poor performance of traditional soft sensor modeling methods. Deep learning, as a kind of data-driven approach, shows its great potential in many fields, as well as in soft sensing scenarios. After a period of development, especially in the last five years, many new issues have emerged that need to be investigated. Therefore, in this article, the necessity and significance of deep learning for soft sensor applications are demonstrated first by analyzing the merits of deep learning and the trends of industrial processes. Next, mainstream deep learning models, tricks, and frameworks/toolkits are summarized and discussed to help designers propel the developing progress of soft sensors. Then, existing works are reviewed and analyzed to discuss the demands and problems occurred in practical applications. Finally, outlook and conclusions are given.

With this newly proposed concept, a vehicle's driving behaviour will no longer be solely based on the driver's limited and incomplete observation. By taking advantages of the shared information, driving behaviours of CAVs can be improved greatly to a more responsible, accurate and efficient level. This study proposed a reinforcement-learning-based car following model for CAVs in order to obtain an appropriate driving behaviour to improve travel efficiency, fuel consumption and safety at signalized intersections in real-time. The result shows that by specifying an effective reward function, a controller can be learned and works well under different traffic demands as well as traffic light cycles with different durations. This study reveals a great potential of emerging reinforcement learning technologies in transport research and applications.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) has proven useful in designing landslide mitigation strategies for reducing disaster risk and societal and economic losses, which are essential for land use planning, hazard prevention, and risk management. Recent efforts for improving accuracies of LSM have focused on the utilization of convolutional neural network (CNN) in some image-related tasks, however, due to the inconsistency of data representation, CNN-related studies need to be further explored. In this study, a CNN-based approach for LSM was proposed and experimentally applied in a Jiuzhaigou region where a catastrophic earthquake taken place on 8 August 2017, in Sichuan, China. To address the issue of data representation in the CNN model, we proposed a multiscale sampling strategy which to our knowledge is novel in LSM. In this way, the multiscale training samples (i.e., small scale, medium scale and large scale) were generated from the selected eleven landslide causative factors. The success-rate curve (SRC) and prediction-rate curve (PRC) were applied to validate the LSM results, and three conventional machine learning algorithms, i.e., logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, were attempted for comparison. Specifically, MLP neural network achieved the best performance among three machine learning methods, with the area under the SRC (AU-SRC) and PRC (AU-PRC) values of 81.18% and 82.84%, respectively. Nevertheless, the AU-SRC and AU-PRC values of CNN-based approach reached to 97.45% and 88.02%, which were about 16% and 6% higher than that of the MLP neural network, respectively. The present study demonstrated both the excellent goodness-of-fit and strong prediction ability of CNN-based approach for LSM, which also showed the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed multiscale sampling strategy. Additionally, present study revealed that the spatial data close to the landslide location might be more suitable to predict the probability of the landslide occurrence. Finally, we expect that the deep learning method based on multiscale data representation will advance our ability to assess the landslide susceptibility and raise the awareness of landslide disasters.

At present, the scale of wind speed time-history data is increasing, and its time resolution is also becoming higher. Traditional machine learning models cannot effectively capture and utilize nonlinear features from the large scaled dataset and this, not only increases the difficulty of model building, but also reduces the prediction accuracy. To overcome such challenges, a machine learning based framework involving data-mining method was proposed in this paper. To begin with, a powerful signal decomposition technique (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) was used to divide the original wind sequence into several intrinsic mode functions to form a potential feature set. Then, a more appropriate sub-feature set together with the corresponding machine learning model were automatically generated through an iteration process. Such process was constructed through a coupled algorithm using the binary coded searching method known as the genetic algorithm and the advanced recurrent neural network with long short term memory unit. The analytical results show that, when compared with the traditional mainstream models, the strategy of using the sequences provided by the signal decomposition technology as the input features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. On the other hand, faced with the high-dimensional feature set generated from the big data, the selected sub-feature set can not only perform a large dimension reduction, but also further improve the prediction accuracy up to 28.33% in terms of different kinds of evaluation criteria. Therefore, there is a potential application of the proposed method on more accurate short-term wind speed prediction under a considerable dataset of wind history.

In this study, bivariate statistical-based kernel logistic regression (KLR) models with different kernel functions (Polynomial, PUK, and Radial Basis Function), named the PLKLR, PUKLR, and RBFKLR models, were proposed for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Zichang City, China. Meanwhile, the present study aims to build landslide susceptibility maps based on bivariate statistical correlation analysis, optimization of different kernel functions, comparison of three landslide susceptibility maps and systematic analysis of spatial patterns. The steps of this article are organized as follows: Firstly, a landslide inventory containing 263 historical landslide locations was constructed. For the purpose of training and validation of models, 263 landslide locations were randomly divided into two parts with a ratio of 70/30. Secondly, 14 landslide conditioning factors were extracted from the spatial database. Subsequently, correlation analysis between the conditioning factors and the occurrence of landslides was conducted using frequency ratios. Then, the conditioning factors with normalized frequency ratios values were used as inputs to build the landslide susceptibility maps using the three models. A multicollinearity analysis was performed using collinearity statistics. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for comparison and validation of models for recognizing the prediction capability. By further quantitative comparing mapped susceptibility values on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which can acquire underestimations and overestimations of factors (distance to river and slope) and susceptibility area. The results indicated that the PUKLR model had superior performance in landslide susceptibility assessment, with the highest AUC values of 0.884 and 0.766 for training and validation datasets, respectively. This model was followed by the RBFKLR model and the PLKLR model for the training datasets (AUC values of 0.879 and 0.797, respectively), and the PLKLR model and the RBFKLR model for the validation datasets (AUC values of 0.758 and 0.752, respectively). The landslide susceptibility map could help government agencies and decision-makers make wise decisions for future natural hazards prevention in Zichang region.

These can be characterized as big data, because they are large in volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. Security threats to networks, the Internet, websites, and organizations are growing alongside this growth in usage. Detecting intrusions in such a big data environment is difficult. Various intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) using artificial intelligence or machine learning have been proposed for different types of network attacks, but most of these systems either cannot recognize unknown attacks or cannot respond to such attacks in real time. Deep learning models, recently applied to large-scale big data analysis, have shown remarkable performance in general but have not been examined for detection of intrusions in a big data environment. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model to efficiently detect network intrusions based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a weight-dropped, long short-term memory (WDLSTM) network. We use the deep CNN to extract meaningful features from IDS big data and WDLSTM to retain long-term dependencies among extracted features to prevent overfitting on recurrent connections. The proposed hybrid method was compared with traditional approaches in terms of performance on a publicly available dataset, demonstrating its satisfactory performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Landslide susceptibility mapping is an effective means to reduce landslide risk. However, previous studies have not considered spatial heterogeneity. In this study, a hybrid model considering spatial heterogeneity is designed by integrating GeoSOM and Stacking ensemble methods and is applied to map the landslide susceptibility of Zhejiang Province, China. The GeoSOM method was used to cluster the study area into several homogeneous regions to solve the heterogeneity problem, and each region was assigned a cluster attribute as one of the landslide model inputs. The Stacking ensemble technique was utilized to design a high-performance landslide model by combining three traditional machine learning methods (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT)). We collected 1051 landslide samples and fourteen affecting factors after feature selection. For landslide modelling, the landslides were randomly split into two subsets: 70% samples for training and the rest for validation. Landslide models were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and statistical measures. The results indicated that the hybrid model was 0.11-0.135 higher than those of traditional machine learning methods in term of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). In general, this hybrid model can generate high-quality landslide susceptibility maps and help to develop policies that reduce the burden of landslides.

The most common noninvasive BCI modality, electroencephalogram (EEG), is sensitive to noise/artifact and suffers between-subject/within-subject nonstationarity. Therefore, it is difficult to build a generic pattern recognition model in an EEG-based BCI system that is optimal for different subjects, during different sessions, for different devices and tasks. Usually, a calibration session is needed to collect some training data for a new subject, which is time consuming and user unfriendly. Transfer learning (TL), which utilizes data or knowledge from similar or relevant subjects/sessions/devices/tasks to facilitate learning for a new subject/session/device/task, is frequently used to reduce the amount of calibration effort. This article reviews journal publications on TL approaches in EEG-based BCIs in the last few years, i.e., since 2016. Six paradigms and applications-motor imagery, event-related potentials, steady-state visual evoked potentials, affective BCIs, regression problems, and adversarial attacks-are considered. For each paradigm/application, we group the TL approaches into cross-subject/session, cross-device, and cross-task settings and review them separately. Observations and conclusions are made at the end of the article, which may point to future research directions.

The methods are an echo state network (ESN, which is a type of reservoir computing; hereafter RC-ESN), a deep feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM; hereafter RNN-LSTM). This Lorenz 96 system has three tiers of nonlinearly interacting variables representing slow/largescale (X), intermediate (Y), and fast/small-scale (Z) processes. For training or testing, only X is available; Y and Z are never known or used. We show that RC-ESN substantially outperforms ANN and RNN-LSTM for short-term predictions, e.g., accurately forecasting the chaotic trajectories for hundreds of numerical solver's time steps equivalent to several Lyapunov timescales. The RNN-LSTM outperforms ANN, and both methods show some prediction skills too. Furthermore, even after losing the trajectory, data predicted by RC-ESN and RNN-LSTM have probability density functions (pdf's) that closely match the true pdf - even at the tails. The pdf of the data predicted using ANN, however, deviates from the true pdf. Implications, caveats, and applications to data-driven and data-assisted surrogate modeling of complex nonlinear dynamical systems, such as weather and climate, are discussed.

Spatial pooler (SP) is one of the main parts of HTM, designed to learn the spatial information and obtain the sparse distributed representations (SDRs) of input patterns. The other part is temporal memory (TM) which aims to learn the temporal information of inputs. The memristor, which is an appropriate synapse emulator for neuromorphic systems, can be used as the synapse in SP and TM circuits. In this article, a memristor-based SP (MSP) circuit structure is designed to accelerate the execution of the SP algorithm. The presented MSP has properties of modeling both the synaptic permanence and the synaptic connection state within a single synapse, and on-device and parallel learning. Simulation results of statistic metrics and classification tasks on several real-world datasets substantiate the validity of MSP.

AI refers to the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human-like intelligence. Compared to traditional methods, AI offers advantages to deal with problems associated with uncertainties and is an effective aid to solve such complex problems. In addition, AI-based solutions are good alternatives to determine engineering design parameters when testing is not possible, thus resulting in significant savings in terms of human time and effort spent in experiments. AI is also able to make the process of decision making faster, decrease error rates, and increase computational efficiency. Among the different AI techniques, machine learning (ML), pattern recognition (PR), and deep learning (DL) have recently acquired considerable attention and are establishing themselves as a new class of intelligent methods for use in structural engineering. The objective of this review paper is to summarize techniques concerning applications of the noted AI methods in structural engineering developed over the last decade. First, a general introduction to AI is presented and the importance of AI in structural engineering is described. Thereafter, a review of recent applications of ML, PR, and DL in the field is provided, and the capability of such methods to address the restrictions of conventional models are discussed. Further, the advantages of employing such algorithmic methods are discussed in detail. Finally, potential research avenues and emerging trends for employing ML, PR, and DL are presented, and their limitations are discussed.

One of the differences of our proposal with respect to previous works is that input images are processed in three spatial scales along different processing pathways. This mechanism is inspired in the inherent operation of the Human Visual System. The proposed neural model can analyze MRI images containing three types of tumors: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumor, over sagittal, coronal, and axial views and does not need preprocessing of input images to remove skull or vertebral column parts in advance. The performance of our method on a publicly available MRI image dataset of 3064 slices from 233 patients is compared with previously classical machine learning and deep learning published methods. In the comparison, our method remarkably obtained a tumor classification accuracy of 0.973, higher than the other approaches using the same database.

J	Shao, SY; Wang, P; Yan, RQ				Shao, Siyu; Wang, Pu; Yan, Ruqiang			Generative adversarial networks for data augmentation in machine fault diagnosis	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						Auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks; Fault diagnosis; Data augmentation; Signal generation; Induction motor		Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proved to be able to produce artificial data that are alike the real data, and have been successfully applied to various image generation tasks as a useful tool for data augmentation. In this paper, we develop an auxiliary classifier GAN(ACGAN)-based framework to learn from mechanical sensor signals and generate realistic one-dimensional raw data. The proposed architecture contains two parts, generator and discriminator, and both of them are built by stacking one-dimensional convolution layers to learn local features from the original input. Such stacked structure is able to learn hierarchical representations through convolution operation and easy to train. Batch normalization is performed within generator to avoid the problem of gradient vanishing during training, and category labels are used as the auxiliary information in this framework to help train the model. The proposed approach is designed to produce realistic synthesized signals with labels and the generated signals can be used as augmented data for further applications in machine fault diagnosis. In order to evaluate the performance of the generative model, we introduce a set of assessment to evaluate the quality of generated samples, including statistical characteristics and experimental verification. Finally, induction motor vibration signal datasets are utilized to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the high penetration of PV power may challenge the planning and operation of the existing power system owing to the intermittence and randomicity of PV power generation. Achieving accurate forecasting for PV power generation is important for providing high quality electric energy for end-consumers and for enhancing the reliability of power system operation. Motivated by recent advancements in deep learning methods and their satisfactory performance in the energy sector, a hybrid deep learning model combining wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks is proposed in this study. The hybrid deep learning model is utilized for one-hour-ahead PV power forecasting with five-minute intervals. WPD is first used to decompose the original PV power series into sub-series. Next, four independent LSTM networks are developed for these sub-series. Finally, the results predicted by each LSTM network are reconstructed and a linear weighting method is employed to obtain the final forecasting results. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with a case study using an actual dataset collected from Alice Springs, Australia. Comparisons with individual LSTM, recurrent neural network (RNN), gated recurrent (GRU), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models are also presented. The values of three performance evaluation indicators, MBE, MAPE, and RMSE, show that the proposed hybrid deep learning model exhibits superior performance in both forecasting accuracy and stability.

These tools are increasingly being used by the plant science community to make sense of the large datasets now regularly collected via high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping. We review recent work where DL principles have been utilized for digital image-based plant stress phenotyping. We provide a comparative assessment of DL tools against other existing techniques, with respect to decision accuracy, data size requirement, and applicability in various scenarios. Finally, we outline several avenues of research leveraging current and future DL tools in plant science.

Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale.

It is also important to evaluate the innovation capability of a city for city development. In this paper, we propose an ECNN model to evaluate city innovation capability. This model studies innovation capability from the perspective of machine learning. Compared with the existing statistical methods, it is a novel model, to the best of our knowledge, to evaluate the city's innovation capability in terms of machine learning. It overcomes the shortcomings of the original statistical methods for studying the relationship between indicators without considering the relationship between indicators and innovation capabilities. This model first clusters all samples, and the sample categories are marked as clusters. Second, the weight of each indicator is calculated by the entropy gain rate, and the total score is calculated by adding the weighted values of each indicator. To obtain more precise results, the neural network calculates the sample scores, which have the same score but belong to the cluster, with good clustering data as the training set. In this way, different clusters represent different innovation capabilities. Each sample has an innovation capability score. Therefore, the ECNN model has high practicability in evaluating the innovation capability of cities.

Deep learning interpretation of echocardiograms	NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE			English	Article							LEFT ATRIAL VOLUME; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; SIZE; AGE	Echocardiography uses ultrasound technology to capture high temporal and spatial resolution images of the heart and surrounding structures, and is the most common imaging modality in cardiovascular medicine. Using convolutional neural networks on a large new dataset, we show that deep learning applied to echocardiography can identify local cardiac structures, estimate cardiac function, and predict systemic phenotypes that modify cardiovascular risk but not readily identifiable to human interpretation. Our deep learning model, EchoNet, accurately identified the presence of pacemaker leads (AUC = 0.89), enlarged left atrium (AUC = 0.86), left ventricular hypertrophy (AUC = 0.75), left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes (R-2 = 0.74 and R-2 = 0.70), and ejection fraction (R-2 = 0.50), as well as predicted systemic phenotypes of age (R-2 = 0.46), sex (AUC = 0.88), weight (R-2 = 0.56), and height (R-2 = 0.33). Interpretation analysis validates that EchoNet shows appropriate attention to key cardiac structures when performing human-explainable tasks and highlights hypothesis-generating regions of interest when predicting systemic phenotypes difficult for human interpretation. Machine learning on echocardiography images can streamline repetitive tasks in the clinical workflow, provide preliminary interpretation in areas with insufficient qualified cardiologists, and predict phenotypes challenging for human evaluation.

Deep learning-based axial capacity prediction for cold-formed steel channel sections using Deep Belief Network	STRUCTURES			English	Article						Cold-formed steel; Axial capacity; Deep learning; Finite element analysis	LOAD	In this study, a deep learning-based axial capacity prediction for cold-formed steel channel sections is developed using Deep Belief Network (DBN). A total of 10,500 data points for training the DBN are generated from nonlinear elasto plastic finite element analysis, which incorporated both initial imperfections, as recommended by the Australian/New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS 4600:2018) and residual stresses as recommended by Moen et al. A comparison against experimental results found in the literature was conducted. It was found that the DBN was conservative by 9%, 6% and 8% for stub columns, intermediate columns, and slender columns, respectively. When compared against a typical shallow artificial neural network (Backpmpagation Neural Network) and a typical machine learning model (Linear regression model based on PaddlePaddle), it was shown that DBN performed around 2% better than both with the same training data. When the same comparison was made for both the Effective Width Method and the Direct Strength Method, it was found that they were conservative by 15%, 13%, and 15%, respectively. Based on the DBN output data, new and improved design equations for AS/NZS 4600:2018 were proposed.	[Fang, Zhiyuan; Roy, Krishanu; Chen, Boshan; Lim, James B.

Through exploring the possibility of extracting causal interpretations from black-box machine-trained models, we briefly review the languages and concepts in causal inference that may be interesting to machine learning researchers. We start with the curious observation that Friedman's partial dependence plot has exactly the same formula as Pearl's back-door adjustment and discuss three requirements to make causal interpretations: a model with good predictive performance, some domain knowledge in the form of a causal diagram and suitable visualization tools. We provide several illustrative examples and find some interesting and potentially causal relations using visualization tools for black-box models.

For some complex optimization tasks, especially high dimensional and multimodal problems, the conventional MFO may face problems in the convergence trends or be trapped into the local and deceptive optima. Therefore, in this study, two strategies have been introduced into the conventional MFO to get a more stable sense of balance between the exploration and exploitation propensities. First, Gaussian mutation is employed to increase the population diversity of MFO. Then, a chaotic local search is applied to the flame updating process of MFO for better exploiting the locality of the solutions. The proposed CLSGMFO approach was compared against a wide range of well-known classical metaheuristic algorithms (MAs) and various advanced MAs using 23 classical benchmark functions. It was shown that the designed CLSGMFO can outperform most of the popular MAs in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. Moreover, based on CLSGMFO, a hybrid kernel extreme learning machine model, which is called CLSGMFO-KELM, is established to deal with financial stress prediction scenarios. To investigate the effectiveness of the CLSGMFO-KELM model, the proposed hybrid system was tested on two widely used financial datasets and compared against a broad array of popular classifiers. The results demonstrate that the proposed learning scheme can offer a superior kernel extreme learning machine model with excellent predictive performance. Accordingly, the proposed CLSGMFO can serve as an effective and efficient computer-aided tool for financial prediction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The impact of pre- and post-image processing techniques on deep learning frameworks: A comprehensive review for digital pathology image analysis	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Review						Digital pathology; Histology; Deep learning; Image analysis; Pre-processing; Post-processing	TUMOR-INFILTRATING LYMPHOCYTES; BREAST-CANCER; MITOSIS DETECTION; COLOR NORMALIZATION; STAIN NORMALIZATION; NUCLEAR SEGMENTATION; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; CLASSIFICATION; HISTOLOGY; INTEROBSERVER	Recently, deep learning frameworks have rapidly become the main methodology for analyzing medical images. Due to their powerful learning ability and advantages in dealing with complex patterns, deep learning algorithms are ideal for image analysis challenges, particularly in the field of digital pathology. The variety of image analysis tasks in the context of deep learning includes classification (e.g., healthy vs. cancerous tissue), detection (e.g., lymphocytes and mitosis counting), and segmentation (e.g., nuclei and glands segmentation). The majority of recent machine learning methods in digital pathology have a pre- and/or post-processing stage which is integrated with a deep neural network. These stages, based on traditional image processing methods, are employed to make the subsequent classification, detection, or segmentation problem easier to solve. Several studies have shown how the integration of pre- and post-processing methods within a deep learning pipeline can further increase the model's performance when compared to the network by itself. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the types of methods that are used within deep learning frameworks either to optimally prepare the input (pre-processing) or to improve the results of the network output (post-processing), focusing on digital pathology image analysis. Many of the techniques presented here, especially the post-processing methods, are not limited to digital pathology but can be extended to almost any image analysis field.

To this end, in this paper, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model was proposed to predict the HSC compressive strength using 324 data sets with five input independent variables, namely water, cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, and superplasticizer. The prediction results were compared with those of the conventional support vector regression (SVR) model using four metrics, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and correlation coefficient (R-2). The results showed that the prediction accuracy and reliability of LSTM were higher with R-2 = 0.997, RMSE = 0.508, MAE = 0.08, and MAPE = 0.653 compared to the evaluation metrics R-2 = 0.973, RMSE = 1.595, MAE = 0.312, MAPE = 2.469 of the SVR model. The LSTM model is recommended for the pre-estimation of HSC compressive strength under a given mix ratio before the laboratory compression test. Additionally, the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based approach was performed to analyze the relative importance and contribution of the input variables to the output compressive strength.

Using drones, datasets can be captured flexibly and at high spatial and temporal resolutions when needed. In forestry applications, fundamental tasks include the detection of individual trees, tree species classification, biomass estimation, etc. Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown superior results when comparing with conventional machine learning methods such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in cases of huge input data. The objective of this research is to investigate 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) to classify three major tree species in a boreal forest: pine, spruce, and birch. The proposed 3D-CNN models were employed to classify tree species in a test site in Finland. The classifiers were trained with a dataset of 3039 manually labelled trees. Then the accuracies were assessed by employing independent datasets of 803 records. To find the most efficient set of feature combination, we compare the performances of 3D-CNN models trained with hyperspectral (HS) channels, Red-Green-Blue (RGB) channels, and canopy height model (CHM), separately and combined. It is demonstrated that the proposed 3D-CNN model with RGB and HS layers produces the highest classification accuracy. The producer accuracy of the best 3D-CNN classifier on the test dataset were 99.6%, 94.8%, and 97.4% for pines, spruces, and birches, respectively. The best 3D-CNN classifier produced similar to 5% better classification accuracy than the MLP with all layers. Our results suggest that the proposed method provides excellent classification results with acceptable performance metrics for HS datasets. Our results show that pine class was detectable in most layers. Spruce was most detectable in RGB data, while birch was most detectable in the HS layers. Furthermore, the RGB datasets provide acceptable results for many low-accuracy applications.

Nevertheless, the advent of the era of data-driven material science requires an intelligent computational platform to accelerate the discovery and design for advanced materials. Here, we present an open source computational platform named as ALKEMIE, acronyms for Artificial Learning and Knowledge Enhanced Materials Informatics Engineering, which enables easy access of data-driven techniques to broad communities. ALKEMIE is incorporated with three key components for the computational design of materials for the forthcoming data-driven sciences: data generation via high-throughput calculations, data management and data mining via machine learning models. Briefly speaking, the high-throughput calculations in ALKEMIE are implemented through the integration of automatic frameworks of model constructions, calculation performances and data analysis. And the used high-level application programming interface for the database makes the data mining through machine learning more applicable in material science. In particular, ALKEMIE is integrated with a module for the generation of machine-learned interatomic potential for large-scale molecular dynamic simulations where the dataset is obtained from high-throughput first-principles calculations. More importantly, ALKEMIE has an elaborately designed user-friendly graphical user-interface which makes the workflow and dataflow more maneuverable and transparent, facilitating its easy-to-use for scientists with broad backgrounds. Finally, the main characters of ALKEMIE are demonstrated using three computational examples.

In recent years, deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, is emerging as a powerful tool to address problems by learning from data, largely driven by the availability of massive datasets, enhanced computational power, fast data storage, and novel training algorithms for the deep neural network. It is currently promoting increased interests and gaining extensive attention for its utilization in the field of optical metrology. Unlike the traditional "physics-based" approach, deep-learning-enabled optical metrology is a kind of "data-driven" approach, which has already provided numerous alternative solutions to many challenging problems in this field with better performances. In this review, we present an overview of the current status and the latest progress of deep-learning technologies in the field of optical metrology. We first briefly introduce both traditional image-processing algorithms in optical metrology and the basic concepts of deep learning, followed by a comprehensive review of its applications in various optical metrology tasks, such as fringe denoising, phase retrieval, phase unwrapping, subset correlation, and error compensation. The open challenges faced by the current deep-learning approach in optical metrology are then discussed. Finally, the directions for future research are outlined.

However, existing applications are generally restricted to the implementation of Breiman's original algorithm for regression and classification problems, while numerous developments could be also useful in solving diverse practical problems in the water sector. Here we popularize RF and their variants for the practicing water scientist, and discuss related concepts and techniques, which have received less attention from the water science and hydrologic communities. In doing so, we review RF applications in water resources, highlight the potential of the original algorithm and its variants, and assess the degree of RF exploitation in a diverse range of applications. Relevant implementations of random forests, as well as related concepts and techniques in the R programming language, are also covered.

However, fuel cells are vulnerable to the impurities of hydrogen and operating conditions, which could cause the degradation of output performance over time during operation. Thus, the prediction of the performance degradation draws attention lately and is critical for the reliability of the fuel cell system. In this work, we propose an innovative fuel cell degradation prediction method using Grid Long Short-Term Memory (G-LSTM) recurrent neutral network (RNN). Long short-term memory cell can effectively avoid the gradient exploding and vanishing problem compared with conventional neutral network architecture, which makes it suitable for the prediction problem for long period. By paralleling and combining the cells, Grid long short-term memory cell architecture can further optimize the prediction accuracy of the fuel cell performance degradation. The proposed prediction model is experimentally validated by three different types of PEMFC: 1.2 kW Ballard Nexa fuel cells, 1 kW Proton Motor fuel cells and 25 kW Proton Motor fuel cells. The results indicate that the proposed Grid long short-term memory network can predict the fuel cell degradation in a precise way. The proposed deep learning approach can be efficiently applied to predict the lifetime of fuel cell in transportation applications.

J	Lloyd, S; Weedbrook, C				Lloyd, Seth; Weedbrook, Christian			Quantum Generative Adversarial Learning	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								Generative adversarial networks represent a powerful tool for classical machine learning: a generator tries to create statistics for data that mimics those of a true data set, while a discriminator tries to discriminate between the true and fake data. The learning process for generator and discriminator can be thought of as an adversarial game, and under reasonable assumptions, the game converges to the point where the generator generates the same statistics as the true data and the discriminator is unable to discriminate between the true and the generated data. This Letter introduces the notion of quantum generative adversarial networks, where the data consist either of quantum states or of classical data, and the generator and discriminator are equipped with quantum information processors. We show that the unique fixed point of the quantum adversarial game also occurs when the generator produces the same statistics as the data. Neither the generator nor the discriminator perform quantum tomography; linear programing drives them to the optimal. Since quantum systems are intrinsically probabilistic, the proof of the quantum case is different from-and simpler than-the classical case. We show that, when the data consist of samples of measurements made on high-dimensional spaces, quantum adversarial networks may exhibit an exponential advantage over classical adversarial networks.

As such, we propose a federated learning (FL) based approach to promote privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning for applications in smart industries. In our system model, a model owner initiates an FL task involving a group of workers, i.e., data owners, to perform model training on their locally stored data before transmitting the model updates for aggregation. There exists a tradeoff between service latency, i.e., the time taken for the training request to be completed, and age of information (AoI), i.e., the time elapsed between data aggregation from the deployed industrial Internet of Things devices to completion of the FL-based training. On one hand, if the data are collected only upon the model owner's request, the AoI is low. On the other hand, the service latency incurred is more significant. Furthermore, given that different training tasks may have varying AoI requirements, we propose a contract-theoretic task-aware incentive scheme that can be calibrated based on the weighted preferences of the model owner toward AoI and service latency. The performance evaluation validates the incentive compatibility of our contract amid information asymmetry, and shows the flexibility of our proposed scheme toward satisfying varying preferences of AoI and service latency.

It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.

We aimed to evaluate and validate the predictive performance of the CT-based model using deep learning features for predicting pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Materials and methods: Patients were retrospectively enrolled between April 2007 and December 2018 from two institutions. We extracted deep learning features of six pre-trained convolutional neural networks, respectively, from pretreatment CT images in the training cohort (n = 161). Support vector machine was adopted as the classifier. Validation was performed in an external testing cohort (n = 70). We assessed the performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and selected an optimal model, which was compared with a radiomics model developed from the training cohort. A clinical model consisting of clinical factors only was also built for baseline comparison. We further conducted a radiogenomics analysis using gene expression profiles to reveal underlying biology associated with radiological prediction. Results: The optimal model with features extracted from ResNet50 achieved an AUC and accuracy of 0.805 (95% CI, 0.696-0.913) and 77.1% (65.6%-86.3%) in the testing cohort, compared with 0.725 (0.605-0.846)) and 67.1% (54.9%-77.9%) for the radiomics model. All the radiological models showed better predictive performance than the clinical model. Radiogenomics analysis suggested a potential association mainly with WNT signaling pathway and tumor microenvironment. Conclusions: The novel and noninvasive deep learning approach could provide efficient and accurate prediction of treatment response to nCRT in ESCC, and benefit clinical decision making of therapeutic strategy.

Satellite-based soybean yield forecast: Integrating machine learning and weather data for improving crop yield prediction in southern Brazil	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY			English	Article						Yield forecast; Satellite imagery; Deep learning; Long-Short Term Memory	SENSED VEGETATION INDEXES; CORN; WHEAT; AREA	Soybean yield predictions in Brazil are of great interest for market behavior, to drive governmental policies and to increase global food security. In Brazil soybean yield data generally demand various revisions through the following months after harvest suggesting that there is space for improving the accuracy and the time of yield predictions. This study presents a novel model to perform in-season ("near real-time") soybean yield forecasts in southern Brazil using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Neural Networks, satellite imagery and weather data. The objectives of this study were to: (i) compare the performance of three different algorithms (multivariate OLS linear regression, random forest and LSTM neural networks) for forecasting soybean yield using NDVI, EVI, land surface temperature and precipitation as independent variables, and (ii) evaluate how early (during the soybean growing season) this method is able to forecast yield with reasonable accuracy. Satellite and weather data were masked using a non-crop-specific layer with field boundaries obtained from the Rural Environment Registry that is mandatory for all farmers in Brazil. Main outcomes from this study were: (i) soybean yield forecasts at municipality-scale with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24 Mg ha(-1) at DOY 64 (march 5) (ii) a superior performance of the LSTM neural networks relative to the other algorithms for all the forecast dates except DOY 16 where multivariate OLS linear regression provided the best performance, and (iii) model performance (e.g., MAE) for yield forecast decreased when predictions were performed earlier in the season, with MAE increasing from 0.24 Mg ha(-1) to 0.42 Mg ha(-1) (last values from OLS regression) when forecast timing changed from DOY 64 (March 5) to DOY 16 (January 6). This research portrays the benefits of integrating statistical techniques, remote sensing, weather to field survey data in order to perform more reliable in-season soybean yield forecasts.

Kayak, a popular outdoor sport, employs the coordination of multiple muscles and skeletons, especially those of upper limbs that must be investigated carefully. The fine-time phase segmentation of rowing cycle plays an important role in analyzing kayaker's technique. Aiming at the problem of laborious manual phase labeling in the traditional video analysis method, an automatic phase segmentation method for kayak rowing is proposed combined with a machine learning algorithm. In this article, inertial sensors and a data fusion algorithm are used to calculate the joint angles between arm and trunk, left elbow and right elbow when the athlete is rowing. According to the permutation and combination principle, the angle sequence is combined in nine different ways, and four machine learning algorithms (decision tree, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, bagging ensemble learning) are used to study the effects of different combinations on rowing phase division. Among them, the precision of phase segmentation becomes higher with the increase of motion information. The combination of arm to trunk joint angle only needs three data collection nodes; thus, the computational cost is smaller; moreover, all the four algorithms show good classification accuracy (up to 98.1%). The results indicating that the combination of arm to trunk joint angle and support vector machine algorithm could better complete the task of the phase segmentation for kayak rowing.

However, accurate screening of COVID-19 is still a massive challenge due to the spatial complexity of 3D volumes, the labeling difficulty of infection areas, and the slight discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in chest CT. While a few pioneering works have made significant progress, they are either demanding manual annotations of infection areas or lack of interpretability. In this paper, we report our attempt towards achieving highly accurate and interpretable screening of COVID-19 from chest CT with weak labels. We propose an attention-based deep 3D multiple instance learning (AD3D-MIL) where a patient-level label is assigned to a 3D chest CT that is viewed as a bag of instances. AD3D-MIL can semantically generate deep 3D instances following the possible infection area. AD3D-MIL further applies an attention-based pooling approach to 3D instances to provide insight into each instance's contribution to the bag label. AD3D-MIL finally learns Bernoulli distributions of the bag-level labels for more accessible learning. We collected 460 chest CT examples: 230 CT examples from 79 patients with COVID-19, 100 CT examples from 100 patients with common pneumonia, and 130 CT examples from 130 people without pneumonia. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 97.9%, AUC of 99.0%, and Cohen kappa score of 95.7%. These advantages endow our algorithm as an efficient assisted tool in the screening of COVID-19.

However, computational approaches have emerged as a time- and cost-efficient way to prioritize combinations to test, based on recently available large-scale combination screening data. Recently, Deep Learning has had an impact in many research areas by achieving new state-of-theart model performance. However, Deep Learning has not yet been applied to drug synergy prediction, which is the approach we present here, termed DeepSynergy. DeepSynergy uses chemical and genomic information as input information, a normalization strategy to account for input data heterogeneity, and conical layers to model drug synergies. Results: DeepSynergy was compared to other machine learning methods such as Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Elastic Nets on the largest publicly available synergy dataset with respect to mean squared error. DeepSynergy significantly outperformed the other methods with an improvement of 7.2% over the second best method at the prediction of novel drug combinations within the space of explored drugs and cell lines. At this task, the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between the measured and the predicted values of DeepSynergy was 0.73. Applying DeepSynergy for classification of these novel drug combinations resulted in a high predictive performance of an AUC of 0.90. Furthermore, we found that all compared methods exhibit low predictive performance when extrapolating to unexplored drugs or cell lines, which we suggest is due to limitations in the size and diversity of the dataset. We envision that DeepSynergy could be a valuable tool for selecting novel synergistic drug combinations.

Learning to hash is one of the major solutions to this problem and has been widely studied recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the learning to hash algorithms, categorize them according to the manners of preserving the similarities into: pairwise similarity preserving, multiwise similarity preserving, implicit similarity preserving, as well as quantization, and discuss their relations. We separate quantization from pairwise similarity preserving as the objective function is very different though quantization, as we show, can be derived from preserving the pairwise similarities. In addition, we present the evaluation protocols, and the general performance analysis, and point out that the quantization algorithms perform superiorly in terms of search accuracy, search time cost, and space cost. Finally, we introduce a few emerging topics.

However, the signals in machine faulty states are usually difficult and expensive to collect, resulting in imbalanced training dataset in most cases. That significantly deteriorates the effectiveness of the existing data-driven approaches. This paper proposes a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method to address the imbalanced data problem by explicitly creating additional training data. Generative adversarial networks are firstly used to learn the mapping between the distributions of noise and real machinery temporal vibration data, and additional realistic fake samples can be generated to balance and further expand the available dataset afterwards. Through experiments on two rotating machinery datasets, it is validated that the data-driven methods can significantly benefit from the data augmentation, and the proposed method offers a promising tool on fault diagnosis with imbalanced training data.

Ground vibration generated due to blasting is an undesirable phenomenon which is harmful for the nearby structures and should be prevented. In this regard, a novel intelligent approach for predicting blast-induced PPV was developed. The distinctive Jaya algorithm and high efficient extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) were applied to obtain the goal, called the Jaya-XGBoost model. Accordingly, 150 sets of data composed of 13 controllable and uncontrollable parameters are chosen as input independent variables and the measured peak particle velocity (PPV) is chosen as an output dependent variable. Also, the Jaya algorithm was used for optimization of hyper-parameters of XGBoost. Additionally, six empirical models and several machine learning models such as XGBoost, random forest, AdaBoost, artificial neural network and Bagging were also considered and applied for comparison of the proposed Jaya-XGBoost model. Accuracy criteria including determination coefficient (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the variance accounted for (VAF) were used for the assessment of models. For this study, 150 blasting operations were analyzed. Also, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method is used to interpret the importance of features and their contribution to PPV prediction. Findings reveal that the proposed Jaya-XGBoost emerged as the most reliable model in contrast to other machine learning models and traditional empirical models. This study may be helpful to mining researchers and engineers who use intelligent machine learning algorithms to predict blast-induced ground vibration.

Less is more: Sampling chemical space with active learning	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							FORCE-FIELD; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; VIRTUAL EXPLORATION; CHEMISTRY; INSIGHTS; UNIVERSE; VALIDATION; AUTOMATION; ACCURACY; DATABASE	The development of accurate and transferable machine learning (ML) potentials for predicting molecular energetics is a challenging task. The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble's prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential achieves a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecules or materials, while remaining applicable to the general class of organic molecules composed of the elements CHNO.

Deep-Learning System Detects Neoplasia in Patients With Barrett's Esophagus With Higher Accuracy Than Endoscopists in a Multistep Training and Validation Study With Benchmarking	GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						artificial intelligence; Barrett surveillance; esophageal cancer; machine learning	COLORECTAL LESIONS; ADENOCARCINOMA; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; HISTOLOGY	BACKGROUND & AIMS: We aimed to develop and validate a deep-learning computer-aided detection (CAD) system, suitable for use in real time in clinical practice, to improve endoscopic detection of early neoplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). METHODS: We developed a hybrid ResNet-UNet model CAD system using 5 independent endoscopy data sets. We performed pretraining using 494,364 labeled endoscopic images collected from all intestinal segments. Then, we used 1704 unique esophageal high-resolution images of rigorously confirmed early-stage neoplasia in BE and nondysplastic BE, derived from 669 patients. System performance was assessed by using data sets 4 and 5. Data set 5 was also scored by 53 general endoscopists with a wide range of experience from 4 countries to benchmark CAD system performance. Coupled with histopathology findings, scoring of images that contained early-stage neoplasia in data sets 2-5 were delineated in detail for neoplasm position and extent by multiple experts whose evaluations served as the ground truth for segmentation. RESULTS: The CAD system classified images as containing neoplasms or nondysplastic BE with 89% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 88% specificity (data set 4, 80 patients and images). In data set 5 (80 patients and images) values for the CAD system vs those of the general endoscopists were 88% vs 73% accuracy, 93% vs 72% sensitivity, and 83% vs 74% specificity. The CAD system achieved higher accuracy than any of the individual 53 nonexpert endoscopists, with comparable delineation performance. CAD delineations of the area of neoplasm overlapped with those from the BE experts in all detected neoplasia in data sets 4 and 5. The CAD system identified the optimal site for biopsy of detected neoplasia in 97% and 92% of cases (data sets 4 and 5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We developed, validated, and benchmarked a deep-learning computer-aided system for primary detection of neoplasia in patients with BE. The system detected neoplasia with high accuracy and near-perfect delineation performance.

Deep Learning for Predicting Complex Traits in Spring Wheat Breeding Program	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; deep learning; genomic selection; multilayer perceptron; neural networks; wheat breeding	GENOME-ENABLED PREDICTION; RIDGE-REGRESSION; GENETIC VALUE; SELECTION; REGISTRATION; ASSOCIATION; PACKAGE; DISEASE	Genomic selection (GS) is transforming the field of plant breeding and implementing models that improve prediction accuracy for complex traits is needed. Analytical methods for complex datasets traditionally used in other disciplines represent an opportunity for improving prediction accuracy in GS. Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) which focuses on densely connected networks using artificial neural networks for training the models. The objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of DL models in the Washington State University spring wheat breeding program. We compared the performance of two DL algorithms, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), with ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (rrBLUP), a commonly used GS model. The dataset consisted of 650 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a spring wheat nested association mapping (NAM) population planted from 2014-2016 growing seasons. We predicted five different quantitative traits with varying genetic architecture using cross-validations (CVs), independent validations, and different sets of SNP markers. Hyperparameters were optimized for DL models by lowering the root mean square in the training set, avoiding model overfitting using dropout and regularization. DL models gave 0 to 5% higher prediction accuracy than rrBLUP model under both cross and independent validations for all five traits used in this study. Furthermore, MLP produces 5% higher prediction accuracy than CNN for grain yield and grain protein content. Altogether, DL approaches obtained better prediction accuracy for each trait, and should be incorporated into a plant breeder's toolkit for use in large scale breeding programs.

Researchers have proposed various detection methods fostered by machine learning (ML) techniques. Federated learning (FL), as a promising distributed ML paradigm, has been employed recently to improve detection performance due to its advantages of privacy-preserving and lower latency. However, existing FL-based methods still suffer from efficiency, robustness, and security challenges. To address these problems, in this article, we initially introduce a blockchain-empowered decentralized and asynchronous FL framework for anomaly detection in IoT systems, which ensures data integrity and prevents single-point failure while improving the efficiency. Further, we design an improved differentially private FL based on generative adversarial nets, aiming to optimize data utility throughout the training process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a decentralized FL approach with privacy-preserving for IoT anomaly detection. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance from aspects of robustness, accuracy, and fast convergence while maintaining high level of privacy and security protection.

An adaptive optimal controller is designed using the online actor-critic learning and is robustified against unmodeled dynamics. To deal with unmodeled dynamics, an auxiliary signal with the system state as its input signal is designed to capture the input-to-state stability. In addition to the critic network for value function approximation, a novel robustifying term is developed and introduced into the actor network to ensure robustness during the learning process. It is shown that both the actor and the critic weights learning converge to their optimal values while guaranteeing the boundedness of all the signals in the closed loop. Simulation examples are conducted to verify the efficacy of the presented scheme.

However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.

The focus is on patient screening and identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), which represents a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach operates with a large volume of raw ECG time-series data as inputs to a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). It autonomously learns representative and key features of the PAF to be used by a classification module. The features are therefore learned directly from the large time domain ECG signals by using a CNN with one fully connected layer. The learned features can effectively replace the traditional ad hoc and time-consuming user's hand-crafted features. Our experimental results verify and validate the effectiveness and capabilities of the learned features for PAF patient screening. The main advantages of our proposed approach are to simplify the feature extraction process corresponding to different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to define appropriate and critical features working with a large time-series data set. The extensive simulations and case studies conducted indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will significantly improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an end-to-end CNN classifier. The effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed ECG DL classification machine is demonstrated and quantitative comparisons with several conventional machine learning classifiers are also provided.

In this work, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced in epileptic seizure prediction using EEG signals, expanding the use of deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNN). A pre-analysisis initially performed to find the optimal architecture of the LSTM network by testing several modules and layers of memory units. Based on these results, a two-layer LSTM network is selected to evaluate seizure prediction performance using four different length of preictal windows, ranging from 15 min to 2 h. The LSTM model exploits a wide range of features extracted prior to classification, including time and frequency domain features, between EEG channels cross-correlation and graph theoretic features. The evaluation is performed using long-term EEG recordings from the open CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, suggest that the proposed methodology is able to predict all 185 seizures, providing high rates of seizure prediction sensitivity and low false prediction rates (FPR) of 0.11-0.02 false alarms per hour, depending on the duration of the preictal window. The proposed LSTM-based methodology delivers a significant increase in seizure prediction performance compared to both traditional machine learning techniques and convolutional neural networks that have been previously evaluated in the literature.

Deep Learning for Person Re-Identification: A Survey and Outlook	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Annotations; Cameras; Training; Training data; Feature extraction; Data models; Deep learning; Person re-identification; pedestrian retrieval; literature survey; evaluation metric; deep learning	PEDESTRIAN DETECTION; ATTENTION; RANKING; ADAPTATION; NETWORK	Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at retrieving a person of interest across multiple non-overlapping cameras. With the advancement of deep neural networks and increasing demand of intelligent video surveillance, it has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community. By dissecting the involved components in developing a person Re-ID system, we categorize it into the closed-world and open-world settings. The widely studied closed-world setting is usually applied under various research-oriented assumptions, and has achieved inspiring success using deep learning techniques on a number of datasets. We first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis for closed-world person Re-ID from three different perspectives, including deep feature representation learning, deep metric learning and ranking optimization. With the performance saturation under closed-world setting, the research focus for person Re-ID has recently shifted to the open-world setting, facing more challenging issues. This setting is closer to practical applications under specific scenarios. We summarize the open-world Re-ID in terms of five different aspects. By analyzing the advantages of existing methods, we design a powerful AGW baseline, achieving state-of-the-art or at least comparable performance on twelve datasets for four different Re-ID tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric (mINP) for person Re-ID, indicating the cost for finding all the correct matches, which provides an additional criteria to evaluate the Re-ID system for real applications. Finally, some important yet under-investigated open issues are discussed.

While the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently achieved tremendous success in RSSC, its superior performances highly depend on a large number of accurately labeled samples which require lots of time and manpower to generate for a large-scale remote sensing image scene dataset. In contrast, it is not only relatively easy to collect coarse and noisy labels but also inevitable to introduce label noise when collecting large-scale annotated data in the remote sensing scenario. Therefore, it is of great practical importance to robustly learn a superior CNN-based classification model from the remote sensing image scene dataset containing non-negligible or even significant error labels. To this end, this article proposes a new RSSC-oriented error-tolerant deep learning (RSSC-ETDL) approach to mitigate the adverse effect of incorrect labels of the remote sensing image scene dataset. In our proposed RSSC-ETDL method, learning multiview CNNs and correcting error labels are alternatively conducted in an iterative manner. It is noted that to make the alternative scheme work effectively, we propose a novel adaptive multifeature collaborative representation classifier (AMF-CRC) that benefits from adaptively combining multiple features of CNNs to correct the labels of uncertain samples. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of error-tolerant methods in the remote sensing domain, we construct remote sensing image scene datasets with: 1) simulated noisy labels by corrupting the open datasets with varying error rates and 2) real noisy labels by deploying the greedy annotation strategies that are practically used to accelerate the process of annotating remote sensing image scene datasets. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that our proposed RSSC-ETDL approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

H.; Alkahtani, Hasan			Attacks to Automatous Vehicles: A Deep Learning Algorithm for Cybersecurity	SENSORS			English	Article						in-vehicle network; CAN; cybersecurity; intrusion detection; deep learning; artificial intelligence	INTRUSION DETECTION; ANOMALY DETECTION; SECURITY	Rapid technological development has changed drastically the automotive industry. Network communication has improved, helping the vehicles transition from completely machine- to software-controlled technologies. The autonomous vehicle network is controlled by the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. Nevertheless, the autonomous vehicle network still has issues and weaknesses concerning cybersecurity due to the complexity of data and traffic behaviors that benefit the unauthorized intrusion to a CAN bus and several types of attacks. Therefore, developing systems to rapidly detect message attacks in CAN is one of the biggest challenges. This study presents a high-performance system with an artificial intelligence approach that protects the vehicle network from cyber threats. The system secures the autonomous vehicle from intrusions by using deep learning approaches. The proposed security system was verified by using a real automatic vehicle network dataset, including spoofing, flood, replaying attacks, and benign packets. Preprocessing was applied to convert the categorical data into numerical. This dataset was processed by using the convolution neural network (CNN) and a hybrid network combining CNN and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) models to identify attack messages. The results revealed that the model achieved high performance, as evaluated by the metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The proposed system achieved high accuracy (97.30%). Along with the empirical demonstration, the proposed system enhanced the detection and classification accuracy compared with the existing systems and was proven to have superior performance for real-time CAN bus security.

According to the current literature, this kind of investigation has rarely been conducted. The Hyrcanian forest area (Iran) is selected as the case study. For this purpose, a total of 149 sample plots for the study area were documented through fieldwork. Using the imagery, three datasets were generated including the Sentinel-2A dataset, the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset, and the combination of the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset (Sentinel-ALOS). Because the accuracy of the AGB estimation is dependent on the method used, in this research, four machine learning techniques were selected and compared, namely Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MPL Neural Nets), and Gaussian Processes (GP). The performance of these AGB models was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the AGB models derived from the combination of the Sentinel-2A and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data had the highest accuracy, followed by models using the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset. Among the four machine learning models, the SVR model (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 38.68, and MAE = 32.28) had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by the GP model (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 40.11, and MAE = 33.69), the RF model (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 43.13, and MAE = 35.83), and the MPL Neural Nets model (R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 64.33, and MAE = 53.74). Overall, the Sentinel-2A imagery provides a reasonable result while the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery provides a poor result of the forest AGB estimation. The combination of the Sentinel-2A imagery and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery improved the estimation accuracy of AGB compared to that of the Sentinel-2A imagery only.

A comparison study of descriptor-based and graph-based models	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Graph neural networks; Extreme gradient boosting; Ensemble learning; Deep learning; ADME; T prediction	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; IN-SILICO PREDICTION; RANDOM FOREST; INTESTINAL-ABSORPTION; ADMET EVALUATION; CLASSIFICATION; BIOACTIVITY; TOXICITY; INTELLIGENCE; REGRESSION	Graph neural networks (GNN) has been considered as an attractive modelling method for molecular property prediction, and numerous studies have shown that GNN could yield more promising results than traditional descriptor-based methods. In this study, based on 11 public datasets covering various property endpoints, the predictive capacity and computational efficiency of the prediction models developed by eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including four descriptor-based models (SVM, XGBoost, RF and DNN) and four graph-based models (GCN, GAT, MPNN and Attentive FP), were extensively tested and compared. The results demonstrate that on average the descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. SVM generally achieves the best predictions for the regression tasks. Both RF and XGBoost can achieve reliable predictions for the classification tasks, and some of the graph-based models, such as Attentive FP and GCN, can yield outstanding performance for a fraction of larger or multi-task datasets. In terms of computational cost, XGBoost and RF are the two most efficient algorithms and only need a few seconds to train a model even for a large dataset. The model interpretations by the SHAP method can effectively explore the established domain knowledge for the descriptor-based models. Finally, we explored use of these models for virtual screening (VS) towards HIV and demonstrated that different ML algorithms offer diverse VS profiles.

Here we use machine learning combined with random structure searching (RSS) algorithms to systematically construct an interatomic potential for boron. Starting from ensembles of randomized atomic configurations, we use alternating single-point quantum-mechanical energy and force computations, Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) fitting, and GAP-driven RSS to iteratively generate a representation of the element's potential-energy surface. Beyond the total energies of the very different boron allotropes, our model readily provides atom-resolved, local energies and thus deepened insight into the frustrated beta-rhombohedral boron structure. Our results open the door for the efficient and automated generation of GAPs, and other machine-learning-based interatomic potentials, and suggest their usefulness as a tool for materials discovery.

Accordingly, a DLNN structure with 192 neurons in 3 hidden layers was proposed to construct an inference model that predicts different levels of susceptibility to flash flood. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were selected as the activate function and the transfer function, respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio. The results show that the DLNN attains a good prediction accuracy with Classification Accuracy Rate = 92.05%, Positive Predictive Value = 94.55% and Negative Predictive Value = 89.55%. Compared to benchmarks, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Support Vector Machine, the DLNN performs better; therefore, it could be concluded that the proposed hybridization of GIS and deep learning can be a promising tool to assist the government authorities and involving parties in flash flood mitigation and land-use planning.

Using the recently released GWTC-2 dataset from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, we investigate whether current observations are compatible with the hypothesis that all black hole mergers detected so far arc of primordial origin. We constrain PBH formation models within a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework based on deep learning techniques, finding best-fit values for distinctive features of these models, including the PBH initial mass function, the fraction of PBHs in dark matter, and the accretion efficiency. The presence of several spinning binaries in the GWTC-2 dataset favors a scenario in which PBHs accrete and spin up. Our results indicate that PBHs may comprise only a fraction smaller than 0.3% of the total dark matter, and that the predicted PBH abundance is still compatible with other constraints.	[Wong, Kaze W.

Jorge			The future of digital health with federated learning	NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE			English	Article								Data-driven machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach for building accurate and robust statistical models from medical data, which is collected in huge volumes by modern healthcare systems. Existing medical data is not fully exploited by ML primarily because it sits in data silos and privacy concerns restrict access to this data. However, without access to sufficient data, ML will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making the transition from research to clinical practice. This paper considers key factors contributing to this issue, explores how federated learning (FL) may provide a solution for the future of digital health and highlights the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed.

Reinforcement learning in a large-scale photonic recurrent neural network	OPTICA			English	Article								Photonic neural network implementation has been gaining considerable attention as a potentially disruptive future technology. Demonstrating learning in large-scale neural networks is essential to establish photonic machine learning substrates as viable information processing systems. Realizing photonic neural networks with numerous nonlinear nodes in a fully parallel and efficient learning hardware has been lacking so far. We demonstrate a network of up to 2025 diffractively coupled photonic nodes, forming a large-scale recurrent neural network. Using a digital micro mirror device, we realize reinforcement learning. Our scheme is fully parallel, and the passive weights maximize energy efficiency and bandwidth. The computational output efficiently converges, and we achieve very good performance.

J	Kates-Harbeck, J; Svyatkovskiy, A; Tang, W				Kates-Harbeck, Julian; Svyatkovskiy, Alexey; Tang, William			Predicting disruptive instabilities in controlled fusion plasmas through deep learning	NATURE			English	Article							JET; CHALLENGES; MITIGATION	Nuclear fusion power delivered by magnetic-confinement tokamak reactors holds the promise of sustainable and clean energy(1). The avoidance of large-scale plasma instabilities called disruptions within these reactors(2,3) is one of the most pressing challenges(4,5), because disruptions can halt power production and damage key components. Disruptions are particularly harmful for large burning-plasma systems such as the multibillion-dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project(6) currently under construction, which aims to be the first reactor that produces more power from fusion than is injected to heat the plasma. Here we present a method based on deep learning for forecasting disruptions. Our method extends considerably the capabilities of previous strategies such as first-principles-based(5) and classical machine-learning(7-11) approaches. In particular, it delivers reliable predictions for machines other than the one on which it was trained-a crucial requirement for future large reactors that cannot afford training disruptions. Our approach takes advantage of high-dimensional training data to boost predictive performance while also engaging supercomputing resources at the largest scale to improve accuracy and speed. Trained on experimental data from the largest tokamaks in the United States (DIII-D-12) and the world (Joint European Torus, JET(13)), our method can also be applied to specific tasks such as prediction with long warning times: this opens up the possibility of moving from passive disruption prediction to active reactor control and optimization. These initial results illustrate the potential for deep learning to accelerate progress in fusion-energy science and, more generally, in the understanding and prediction of complex physical systems.

In contrast to what is generally assumed, machine learning approaches can also provide new insights into the underlying biology. Here, we demonstrate this by presenting TargetP 2.0, a novel state-of-the-art method to identify N-terminal sorting signals, which direct proteins to the secretory pathway, mitochondria, and chloroplasts or other plastids. By examining the strongest signals from the attention layer in the network, we find that the second residue in the protein, that is, the one following the initial methionine, has a strong influence on the classification. We observe that two-thirds of chloroplast and thylakoid transit peptides have an alanine in position 2, compared with 20% in other plant proteins. We also note that in fungi and single-celled eukaryotes, less than 30% of the targeting peptides have an amino acid that allows the removal of the N-terminal methionine compared with 60% for the proteins without targeting peptide. The importance of this feature for predictions has not been highlighted before.

However, traditional market segmentation approaches are ineffective in analysing social data on account of size, different dimensions and features of online review data. Machine learning approaches can assist in developing effective hybrid algorithms to overcome data-related complications associated with online reviews. Hence, the objective of this study is to develop a method for spa hotel segmentation and travel choice prediction by applying machine learning approaches. Method evaluation is conducted through a collection of datasets from travelers' ratings and textual reviews of spa hotels on several features in TripAdvisor. Findings confirm that the proposed hybrid machine learning methods can be implemented as an incremental recommendation agent for spa hotel/resort segmentation through effectively utilizing 'big data' procured from online social media contexts.

Deep Learning for real-time gravitational wave detection and parameter estimation: Results with Advanced LIGO data	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Deep Learning; Convolutional neural networks; Gravitational waves; LIGO; Time-series signal processing; Classification and regression	BURSTS	The recent Nobel-prize-winning detections of gravitational waves from merging black holes and the subsequent detection of the collision of two neutron stars in coincidence with electromagnetic observations have inaugurated a new era of multimessenger astrophysics. To enhance the scope of this emergent field of science, we pioneered the use of deep learning with convolutional neural networks, that take time-series inputs, for rapid detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals. This approach, Deep Filtering, was initially demonstrated using simulated LIGO noise. In this article, we present the extension of Deep Filteringusing real data from LIGO, for both detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using continuous data streams from multiple LIGO detectors. We demonstrate for the first time that machine learning can detect and estimate the true parameters of real events observed by LIGO. Our results show that Deep Filtering achieves similar sensitivities and lower errors compared to matched- filtering while being far more computationally efficient and more resilient to glitches, allowing real-time processing of weak time-series signals in non-stationary non-Gaussian noise with minimal resources, and also enables the detection of new classes of gravitational wave sources that may go unnoticed with existing detection algorithms. This unified framework for data analysis is ideally suited to enable coincident detection campaigns of gravitational waves and their multimessenger counterparts in real-time. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Comparing fully convolutional networks, random forest, support vector machine, and patch-based deep convolutional neural networks for object-based wetland mapping using images from small unmanned aircraft system	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						FCN; deep learning; convolutional neural network; OBIA; UAS	SPATIAL-RESOLUTION IMAGERY; REMOTE-SENSING IMAGERY; AERIAL VEHICLE; FEATURE REPRESENTATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LAND-COVER; LIDAR DATA; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; PLATFORM	Deep learning networks have shown great success in several computer vision applications, but its implementation in natural land cover mapping in the context of object-based image analysis (OBIA) is rarely explored area especially in terms of the impact of training sample size on the performance comparison. In this study, two representatives of deep learning networks including fully convolutional networks (FCN) and patch-based deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), and two conventional classifiers including random forest and support vector machine were implemented within the framework of OBIA to classify seven natural land cover types. We assessed the deep learning classifiers using different training sample sizes and compared their performance with traditional classifiers. FCN was implemented using two types of training samples to investigate its ability to utilize object surrounding information.Our results indicate that DCNN may produce inferior performance compared to conventional classifiers when the training sample size is small, but it tends to show substantially higher accuracy than the conventional classifiers when the training sample size becomes large. The results also imply that FCN is more efficient in utilizing the information in the training sample than DCNN and conventional classifiers, with higher if not similar achieved accuracy regardless of sample size. DCNN and FCN tend to show similar performance for the large sample size when the training samples used for training the FCN do not contain object surrounding label information. However, with the ability of utilizing surrounding label information, FCN always achieved much higher accuracy than all the other classification methods regardless of the number of training samples.

Smart healthcare achieves great success by training machine learning models on a large quantity of user personal data. However, there are two critical challenges. First, user data often exist in the form of isolated islands, making it difficult to perform aggregation without compromising privacy security. Second, the models trained on the cloud fail on personalization. In this article, we propose FedHealth, the first federated transfer learning framework for wearable healthcare to tackle these challenges. FedHealth performs data aggregation through federated learning, and then builds relatively personalized models by transfer learning. Wearable activity recognition experiments and real Parkinson's disease auxiliary diagnosis application have evaluated that FedHealth is able to achieve accurate and personalized healthcare without compromising privacy and security. FedHealth is general and extensible in many healthcare applications.

We identified repeat OECD guideline tests to establish reproducibility of acute oral and dermal toxicity, eye and skin irritation, mutagenicity and skin sensitization. Based on 350-700+ chemicals each, the probability that an OECD guideline animal test would output the same result in a repeat test was 78%-96% (sensitivity 50%-87%). An expanded database with more than 866 000 chemical properties/hazards was used as training data and to model health hazards and chemical properties. The constructed models automate and extend the read-across method of chemical classification. The novel models called RASARs (read-across structure activity relationship) use binary fingerprints and Jaccard distance to define chemical similarity. A large chemical similarity adjacency matrix is constructed from this similarity metric and is used to derive feature vectors for supervised learning. We show results on 9 health hazards from 2 kinds of RASARs-"Simple" and "Data Fusion". The "Simple" RASAR seeks to duplicate the traditional read-across method, predicting hazard from chemical analogs with known hazard data. The "Data Fusion" RASAR extends this concept by creating large feature vectors from all available property data rather than only the modeled hazard. Simple RASAR models tested in cross-validation achieve 70%-80% balanced accuracies with constraints on tested compounds. Cross validation of data fusion RASARs show balanced accuracies in the 80%-95% range across 9 health hazards with no constraints on tested compounds.

To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers' data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers' requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers' activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers' privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy (DP) on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally demonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization when features are under DP protection. In addition, to attract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design an incentive mechanism to award participants.

Moench) depends on the distribution of crop-heads in varying branching arrangements. Therefore, counting the head number per unit area is critical for plant breeders to correlate with the genotypic variation in a specific breeding field. However, measuring such phenotypic traits manually is an extremely labor-intensive process and suffers from low efficiency and human errors. Moreover, the process is almost infeasible for large-scale breeding plantations or experiments. Machine learning-based approaches like deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detectors are promising tools for efficient object detection and counting. However, a significant limitation of such deep learning-based approaches is that they typically require a massive amount of hand-labeled images for training, which is still a tedious process. Here, we propose an active learning inspired weakly supervised deep learning framework for sorghum head detection and counting from UAV-based images. We demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce human labeling effort without compromising final model performance (R-2 between human count and machine count is 0.88) by using a semitrained CNN model (i.e., trained with limited labeled data) to perform synthetic annotation. In addition, we also visualize key features that the network learns. This improves trustworthiness by enabling users to better understand and trust the decisions that the trained deep learning model makes.

J	Nour, M; Comert, Z; Polat, K				Nour, Majid; Comert, Zafer; Polat, Kemal			A Novel Medical Diagnosis model for COVID-19 infection detection based on Deep Features and Bayesian Optimization	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						COVID-19; Medical decision support system; Deep learning; Deep feature extraction; Machine learning		A pneumonia of unknown causes, which was detected in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, was declared as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thousands of people have lost their lives to this disease. Its negative effects on public health are ongoing. In this study, an intelligence computer-aided model that can automatically detect positive COVID-19 cases is proposed to support daily clinical applications. The proposed model is based on the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and can automatically reveal discriminative features on chest X-ray images through its convolution with rich filter families, abstraction, and weight-sharing characteristics. Contrary to the generally used transfer learning approach, the proposed deep CNN model was trained from scratch. Instead of the pre-trained CNNs, a novel serial network consisting of five convolution layers was designed. This CNN model was utilized as a deep feature extractor. The extracted deep discriminative features were used to feed the machine learning algorithms, which were k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The experiments were conducted on a public COVID-19 radiology database. The database was divided into two parts as training and test sets with 70% and 30% rates, respectively. As a result, the most efficient results were ensured by the SVM classifier with an accuracy of 98.97%, a sensitivity of 89.39%, a specificity of 99.75%, and an F-score of 96.72%. Consequently, a cheap, fast, and reliable intelligence tool has been provided for COVID-19 infection detection. The developed model can be used to assist field specialists, physicians, and radiologists in the decision-making process.

Pinnau, C. Totzeck, O. Tse, S. Martin, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci.27 (2017) 183-204], which is a gradient-free optimization method for general non-convex functions. We first replace the isotropic geometric Brownian motion by the component-wise one, thus removing the dimensionality dependence of the drift rate, making the method more competitive for high dimensional optimization problems. Secondly, we utilize the random mini-batch ideas to reduce the computational cost of calculating the weighted average which the individual particles tend to relax toward. For its mean-field limit - a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation - we prove, in both time continuous and semi-discrete settings, that the convergence of the method, which is exponential in time, is guaranteed with parameter constraints independent of the dimensionality. We also conduct numerical tests to high dimensional problems to check the success rate of the method.

However, relatively less effort has been spent in understanding and modeling visual attention over dynamic scenes. This work makes three contributions to video saliency research. First, we introduce a new benchmark, called DHF1K (Dynamic Human Fixation 1K), for predicting fixations during dynamic scene free-viewing, which is a long-time need in this field. DHF1K consists of 1K high-quality elaborately-selected video sequences annotated by 17 observers using an eye tracker device. The videos span a wide range of scenes, motions, object types and backgrounds. Second, we propose a novel video saliency model, called ACLNet (Attentive CNN-LSTM Network), that augments the CNN-LSTM architecture with a supervised attention mechanism to enable fast end-to-end saliency learning. The attention mechanism explicitly encodes static saliency information, thus allowing LSTM to focus on learning a more flexible temporal saliency representation across successive frames. Such a design fully leverages existing large-scale static fixation datasets, avoids overfitting, and significantly improves training efficiency and testing performance. Third, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art saliency models on three datasets : DHF1K, Hollywood-2, and UCF sports. An attribute-based analysis of previous saliency models and cross-dataset generalization are also presented. Experimental results over more than 1.2K testing videos containing 400K frames demonstrate that ACLNet outperforms other contenders and has a fast processing speed (40 fps using a single GPU).

Despite enormous effort and huge breakthroughs, however, models still fall short in reaching human-level accuracy. In this work, I explore the landscape of the field emphasizing on new deep saliency models, benchmarks, and datasets. A large number of image and video saliency models are reviewed and compared over two image benchmarks and two large scale video datasets. Further, I identify factors that contribute to the gap between models and humans and discuss the remaining issues that need to be addressed to build the next generation of more powerful saliency models. Some specific questions that are addressed include: in what ways current models fail, how to remedy them, what can be learned from cognitive studies of attention, how explicit saliency judgments relate to fixations, how to conduct fair model comparison, and what are the emerging applications of saliency models.

Multiplex assays for the identification of serological signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection: an antibody-based diagnostic and machine learning study	LANCET MICROBE			English	Article								Background Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces an antibody response targeting multiple antigens that changes over time. This study aims to take advantage of this complexity to develop more accurate serological diagnostics. Methods A multiplex serological assay was developed to measure IgG and IgM antibody responses to seven SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleoprotein antigens, two antigens for the nucleoproteins of the 229E and NL63 seasonal coronaviruses, and three non-coronavirus antigens. Antibodies were measured in serum samples collected up to 39 days after symptom onset from 215 adults in four French hospitals (53 patients and 162 health-care workers) with quantitative RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and negative control serum samples collected from healthy adult blood donors before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (335 samples from France, Thailand, and Peru). Machine learning classifiers were trained with the multiplex data to classify individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the best classification performance displayed by a random forests algorithm. A Bayesian mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset. A statistical estimator is presented that can provide estimates of seroprevalence in very low-transmission settings. Findings IgG antibody responses to trimeric spike protein (S-tri) identified individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with 91.6% (95% CI 87.5-94.5) sensitivity and 99.1% (97.4-99.7) specificity. Using a serological signature of IgG and IgM to multiple antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 98.8% (96.5-99.6) sensitivity and 99.3% (97.6-99.8) specificity. Informed by existing data from other coronaviruses, we estimate that 1 year after infection, a monoplex assay with optimal anti-S-tri IgG cutoff has 88.7% (95% credible interval 63.4-97.4) sensitivity and that a four-antigen multiplex assay can increase sensitivity to 96.4% (80.9-100.0). When applied to population-level serological surveys, statistical analysis of multiplex data allows estimation of seroprevalence levels less than 2%, below the false-positivity rate of many other assays. Interpretation Serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. This provides potential solutions to two pressing challenges for SARS-CoV-2 serological surveillance: classifying individuals who were infected more than 6 months ago and measuring seroprevalence in serological surveys in very low-transmission settings.

Although many improved EC algorithms have been proposed for large-scale optimization, the slow convergence in the huge search space and the trap into local optima among massive suboptima are still the challenges. Targeted to these two issues, this article proposes an adaptive granularity learning distributed particle swarm optimization (AGLDPSO) with the help of machine-learning techniques, including clustering analysis based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and adaptive granularity control based on logistic regression (LR). In AGLDPSO, a master-slave multisubpopulation distributed model is adopted, where the entire population is divided into multiple subpopulations, and these subpopulations are co-evolved. Compared with other large-scale optimization algorithms with single population evolution or centralized mechanism, the multisubpopulation distributed co-evolution mechanism will fully exchange the evolutionary information among different subpopulations to further enhance the population diversity. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive granularity learning strategy (AGLS) based on LSH and LR. The AGLS is helpful to determine an appropriate subpopulation size to control the learning granularity of the distributed subpopulations in different evolutionary states to balance the exploration ability for escaping from massive suboptima and the exploitation ability for converging in the huge search space. The experimental results show that AGLDPSO performs better than or at least comparable with some other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, even the winner of the competition on large-scale optimization, on all the 35 benchmark functions from both IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC2010) and IEEE CEC2013 large-scale optimization test suites.

This study describes the development and validation of a spatially explicit deep learning (DL) neural network model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility. A geospatial database was generated based on 217 landslide events from the Muong Lay district (Vietnam), for which a suite of nine landslide conditioning factors was derived. The Relief-F feature selection method was employed to quantify the utility of the conditioning factors for developing the landslide predictive model. Several performance metrics demonstrated that the DL model performed well both in terms of the goodness-of-fit with the training dataset (AUC = 0.90; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.36) and the ability to predict future landslides (AUC = 0.89; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.38). The efficiency of the model was compared to the quadratic discriminant analysis, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and multi-layer perceptron neural network. A comparative analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant improvement of landslide prediction using the spatially explicit DL model over these other models. The insights provided from this study will be valuable for further development of landslide predictive models and spatially explicit assessment of landslide-prone regions around the world.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Review						Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Chronic disease; Deep learning; Electronic medical record; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Natural language processing; Neural networks; Precision medicine	LEARNING ALGORITHM; DEEP	Computer science advances and ultra-fast computing speeds find artificial intelligence (AI) broadly benefitting modern society-forecasting weather, recognizing faces, detecting fraud, and deciphering genomics. AI's future role in medical practice remains an unanswered question. Machines (computers) learn to detect patterns not decipherable using biostatistics by processing massive datasets (big data) through layered mathematical models (algorithms). Correcting algorithm mistakes (training) adds to AI predictive model confidence. AI is being successfully applied for image analysis in radiology, pathology, and dermatology, with diagnostic speed exceeding, and accuracy paralleling, medical experts. While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100%, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records. In this and other ways, AI may optimize the care trajectory of chronic disease patients, suggest precision therapies for complex illnesses, reduce medical errors, and improve subject enrollment into clinical trials.

Shamim			Deep Learning for EEG motor imagery classification based on multi-layer CNNs feature fusion	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						EEG motor imagery classification; Deep learning; Convolution neural network; Multi-layer CNNs feature fusion	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS	Electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) signals have recently gained a lot of attention as these signals encode a person's intent of performing an action. Researchers have used MI signals to help disabled persons, control devices such as wheelchairs and even for autonomous driving. Hence decoding these signals accurately is important for a Brain-Computer interface (BCI) system. But EEG decoding is a challenging task because of its complexity, dynamic nature and low signal to noise ratio. Convolution neural network (CNN) has shown that it can extract spatial and temporal features from EEG, but in order to learn the dynamic correlations present in MI signals, we need improved CNN models. CNN can extract good features with both shallow and deep models pointing to the fact that, at different levels relevant features can be extracted. Fusion of multiple CNN models has not been experimented for EEG data. In this work, we propose a multi-layer CNNs method for fusing CNNs with different characteristics and architectures to improve EEG MI classification accuracy. Our method utilizes different convolutional features to capture spatial and temporal features from raw EEG data. We demonstrate that our novel MCNN and CCNN fusion methods outperforms all the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques for EEG classification. We have performed various experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN fusion method on public datasets. The proposed MCNN method achieves 75.7% and 95.4% on the BO Competition IV-2a dataset and the High Gamma Dataset respectively. The proposed CCNN method based on autoencoder cross-encoding achieves more than 10% improvement for cross-subject EEG classification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Jude			Deep learning based detection and analysis of COVID-19 on chest X-ray images	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Covid-19; XCeption; Inception net 3; Deep-learning; ResNeXt; Chest X-ray images; CNN	ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME; CT; INFECTION; PNEUMONIA; CHINA	Covid-19 is a rapidly spreading viral disease that infects not only humans, but animals are also infected because of this disease. The daily life of human beings, their health, and the economy of a country are affected due to this deadly viral disease. Covid-19 is a common spreading disease, and till now, not a single country can prepare a vaccine for COVID-19. A clinical study of COVID-19 infected patients has shown that these types of patients are mostly infected from a lung infection after coming in contact with this disease. Chest x-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lunge related problems. Still, a substantial chest x-ray is a lower cost process in comparison to chest CT. Deep learning is the most successful technique of machine learning, which provides useful analysis to study a large amount of chest x-ray images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19. In this work, we have taken the PA view of chest x-ray scans for covid-19 affected patients as well as healthy patients. After cleaning up the images and applying data augmentation, we have used deep learning-based CNN models and compared their performance. We have compared Inception V3, Xception, and ResNeXt models and examined their accuracy. To analyze the model performance, 6432 chest x-ray scans samples have been collected from the Kaggle repository, out of which 5467 were used for training and 965 for validation. In result analysis, the Xception model gives the highest accuracy (i.e., 97.97%) for detecting Chest X-rays images as compared to other models. This work only focuses on possible methods of classifying covid-19 infected patients and does not claim any medical accuracy.

Federated Learning for Wireless Communications: Motivation, Opportunities, and Challenges	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE			English	Article						Training; Wireless communication; Data models; Distributed databases; Computational modeling; 5G mobile communication; Wireless sensor networks		There is a growing interest in the wireless communications community to complement the traditional model-driven design approaches with data-driven machine learning (ML)-based solutions. While conventional ML approaches rely on the assumption of having the data and processing heads in a central entity, this is not always feasible in wireless communications applications because of the inaccessibility of private data and large communication overhead required to transmit raw data to central ML processors. As a result, decentralized ML approaches that keep the data where it is generated are much more appealing. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, federated learning is particularly relevant for many wireless applications, especially in the context of fifth generation (5G) networks. In this article, we provide an accessible introduction to the general idea of federated learning, discuss several possible applications in 5G networks, and describe key technical challenges and open problems for future research on federated learning in the context of wireless communications.

We assume that the semantic labels are governed by several latent attributes with each attribute on or off, and classification relies on these attributes. Based on this assumption, our approach, dubbed supervised semantics-preserving deep hashing (SSDH), constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable hash codes properties. With this design, SSDH has a nice characteristic that classification and retrieval are unified in a single learning model. Moreover, SSDH performs joint learning of image representations, hash codes, and classification in a point-wised manner, and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets. SSDH is simple and can be realized by a slight enhancement of an existing deep architecture for classification; yet it is effective and outperforms other hashing approaches on several benchmarks and large datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, SSDH achieves higher retrieval accuracy, while the classification performance is not sacrificed.

However, traditional yield assessment approaches are laborious and time-consuming, and thus hinder the acquisition of timely information at the field scale. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention in precision agriculture due to their efficiency in data acquisition. In addition, compared with other imaging modalities, hyperspectral data can offer higher spectral fidelity for constructing narrow-band vegetation indices which are of great importance in yield modeling. In this study, we performed an in-season alfalfa yield prediction using UAV-based hyperspectral images. Specifically, we firstly extracted a large number of hyperspectral indices from the original data and performed a feature selection to reduce the data dimensionality. Then, an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining three widely used base learners including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The model performance was evaluated on experimental fields in Wisconsin. Our results showed that the ensemble model outperformed all the base learners and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.874 was achieved when using the selected features. In addition, we also evaluated the model adaptability on different machinery compaction treatments, and the results further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ensemble model.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep network for WSOD. Unlike previous networks that transfer the object detection problem to an image classification problem using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), our strategy generates proposal clusters to learn refined instance classifiers by an iterative process. The proposals in the same cluster are spatially adjacent and associated with the same object. This prevents the network from concentrating too much on parts of objects instead of whole objects. We first show that instances can be assigned object or background labels directly based on proposal clusters for instance classifier refinement, and then show that treating each cluster as a small new bag yields fewer ambiguities than the directly assigning label method. The iterative instance classifier refinement is implemented online using multiple streams in convolutional neural networks, where the first is an MIL network and the others are for instance classifier refinement supervised by the preceding one. Experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC, ImageNet detection, and MS-COCO benchmarks for WSOD. Results show that our method outperforms the previous state of the art significantly.

The fault diagnosis information is an indispensable basis for the collaborative maintenance of the robots in industry 4.0. In this paper, an attitude data-based intelligent fault diagnosis approach is proposed for multi-joint industrial robots. Based on the analysis of the transmission mechanism, the attitude change of the last joint is employed to reflect the transmission fault of robot components. An economical data acquisition strategy is performed by only installing one attitude sensor on the last joint of the multi-joint robot. Considering the characteristics of attitude data, a hybrid sparse auto-encoder (SAE) and support vector machine (SVM) approach, namely SAE-SVM, is subsequently presented to construct an intelligent fault diagnosis model by learning from the attitude dataset with multiple fault information. Experimental results show that the proposed fault diagnosis approach has promising performance in identifying different faults related to the reducer of a 6-axial multi-joint industrial robot accurately and reliably.

However, the data-driven method generally remains a "black box" to researchers and there is a gap between the emerging neural network-based methods and the well-established traditional fault diagnosis knowledge. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based fault diagnosis method for rolling element bearings. Attention mechanism is introduced to assist the deep network to locate the informative data segments, extract the discriminative features of inputs, and visualize the learned diagnosis knowledge. Experiments on a popular rolling bearing dataset intuitively show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is able to provide reliable diagnosis even with very few training data. The experimental results suggest this research offers a promising tool for intelligent fault diagnosis and provides effort in understanding the underlying mechanism of deep neural network.

However, this assumption may be too strict for the real world. Often, novel classes are overlooked when the classification system is constructed. The closed nature forces a model to assign a label given a new sample and may lead to overestimation of known land covers (e.g., crop area). To tackle this issue, we propose a multitask deep learning method that simultaneously conducts classification and reconstruction in the open world (named MDL4OW) where unknown classes may exist. The reconstructed data are compared with the original data; those failing to be reconstructed are considered unknown based on the assumption that they are not well represented in the latent features due to the lack of labels. A threshold needs to be defined to separate the unknown and known classes; we propose two strategies based on the extreme value theory for few- and many-shot scenarios. The proposed method was tested on real-world hyperspectral images; state-of-the-art results were achieved, e.g., improving the overall accuracy by 4.94% for the Salinas data. By considering the existence of unknown classes in the open world, our method achieved more accurate hyperspectral image classification, especially under the few-shot context.

Our study aims to help retail companies create personalized deals and promotions for their customers, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, through a big data framework that allows them to handle massive sales volumes with more efficient models. In this paper, we used Black Friday sales data taken from a dataset on the Kaggle website, which contains nearly 550,000 observations analyzed with 10 features: qualitative and quantitative. The class label is purchases and sales (in U.S. dollars). Because the predictor label is continuous, regression models are suited in this case. Using the Apache Spark big data framework, which uses the MLlib machine learning library, we trained two machine learning models: linear regression and random forest. These machine learning algorithms were used to predict future pricing and sales. We first implemented a linear regression model and a random forest model without using the Spark framework and achieved accuracies of 68% and 74%, respectively. Then, we trained these models on the Spark machine learning big data framework where we achieved an accuracy of 72% for the linear regression model and 81% for the random forest model.

However, current works utilize RNN/LSTM to implicitly capture sequential region/label dependencies, which cannot fully explore mutual interactions among the semantic regions/labels and do not explicitly integrate label co-occurrences. In addition, these works require large amounts of training samples for each category, and they are unable to generalize to novel categories with limited samples. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge-guided graph routing (KGGR) framework, which unifies prior knowledge of statistical label correlations with deep neural networks. The framework exploits prior knowledge to guide adaptive information propagation among different categories to facilitate multi-label analysis and reduce the dependency of training samples. Specifically, it first builds a structured knowledge graph to correlate different labels based on statistical label co-occurrence. Then, it introduces the label semantics to guide learning semantic-specific features to initialize the graph, and it exploits a graph propagation network to explore graph node interactions, enabling learning contextualized image feature representations. Moreover, we initialize each graph node with the classifier weights for the corresponding label and apply another propagation network to transfer node messages through the graph. In this way, it can facilitate exploiting the information of correlated labels to help train better classifiers, especially for labels with limited training samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the traditional multi-label image recognition (MLR) and multi-label few-shot learning (ML-FSL) tasks and show that our KGGR framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by sizable margins on the public benchmarks.

The primary goal of this effort is to properly identify lung cancer, which is critical in preserving a person's life. Lung cancer has been a source of concern for people all around the world for decades. Several researchers presented numerous issues and solutions for various stages of a computer-aided system for diagnosing lung cancer in its early stages, as well as information about lung cancer. Computer vision is one of the field of artificial intelligence this is a better way to detect and prevent the lung cancer. This study focuses on the stages involved in detecting lung tumor regions, namely pre-processing, segmentation, and classification models. An adaptive median filter is used in pre-processing to identify the noise. The work's originality seeks to create a simple yet effective model for the rapid identification and U-net architecture based segmentation of lung nodules. This approach focuses on the identification and segmentation of lung cancer by detecting picture normalcy and abnormalities.

It has been widely applied in medical imaging, remote sensing, image compression, etc. In this paper, we propose two versions of a novel deep learning architecture, dubbed as ADMM-CSNet, by combining the traditional model-based CS method and data-driven deep learning method for image reconstruction from sparsely sampled measurements. We first consider a generalized CS model for image reconstruction with undetermined regularizations in undetermined transform domains, and then two efficient solvers using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for optimizing the model are proposed. We further unroll and generalize the ADMM algorithm to be two deep architectures, in which all parameters of the CS model and the ADMM algorithm are discriminatively learned by end-to-end training. For both applications of fast CS complex-valued MR imaging and CS imaging of real-valued natural images, the proposed ADMM-CSNet achieved favorable reconstruction accuracy in fast computational speed compared with the traditional and the other deep learning methods.

We investigated this question with a scientific mass collaboration using the common task method; 160 teams built predictive models for six life outcomes using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a high-quality birth cohort study. Despite using a rich dataset and applying machine-learning methods optimized for prediction, the best predictions were not very accurate and were only slightly better than those from a simple benchmark model. Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.

As a major branch of machine learning, deep learning (DL) has been applied in physical layer communications and has demonstrated an impressive performance improvement in recent years. However, most existing works related to DL focus on data-driven approaches, which consider the communication system as a black box and train it by using a huge volume of data. Training a network requires sufficient computing resources and extensive time, both of which are rarely found in communication devices. By contrast, model-driven DL approaches combine communication domain knowledge with DL to reduce the demand for computing resources and training time. This article discusses the recent advancements in model-driven DL approaches in physical layer communications, including transmission schemes, receiver design, and channel information recovery. Several open issues for future research are also highlighted.

An effective diagnostic method for paraquat poisoned patients is a crucial concern. Nevertheless, it's difficult to identify the patients with low intake of PQ or delayed treatment. Here, a new efficient diagnostic approach to integrate machine learning and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), named GEE, is proposed to identify the PQ poisoned patients. First, GC-MS provides the original data that efficiently identified the paraquat-poisoned patients. According to the high dimensionality of the original data, in the second stage, the chaos enhanced grey wolf optimization (EGWO) is adopted to search the optimal feature sets to improve the accuracy of identification. Finally, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to identify the PQ poisoned patients. To efficiently evaluate the proposed method, four measures were used in our experiments and comparisons were made with six other methods. The PQ-poisoned patients and robust volunteers can be well identified by GEE and the values of AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 95.14%, 93.89%, 94.44% and 95.83%, respectively. Our experimental results demonstrated that GEE had better performance and might serve as a novel candidate diagnosis of PQ-poisoned patients.

Effect of a Machine Learning-Derived Early Warning System for Intraoperative Hypotension vs Standard Care on Depth and Duration of Intraoperative Hypotension During Elective Noncardiac Surgery The HYPE Randomized Clinical Trial	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							HIGH-RISK PATIENTS; MYOCARDIAL INJURY; ACUTE KIDNEY; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY; COHORT	Importance Intraoperative hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A machine learning-derived early warning system to predict hypotension shortly before it occurs has been developed and validated. Objective To test whether the clinical application of the early warning system in combination with a hemodynamic diagnostic guidance and treatment protocol reduces intraoperative hypotension. Design, Setting, and Participants Preliminary unblinded randomized clinical trial performed in a tertiary center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, among adult patients scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia and an indication for continuous invasive blood pressure monitoring, who were enrolled between May 2018 and March 2019. Hypotension was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65 mm Hg for at least 1 minute. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the early warning system (n = 34) or standard care (n = 34), with a goal MAP of at least 65 mm Hg in both groups. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was time-weighted average of hypotension during surgery, with a unit of measure of millimeters of mercury. This was calculated as the depth of hypotension below a MAP of 65 mm Hg (in millimeters of mercury) x time spent below a MAP of 65 mm Hg (in minutes) divided by total duration of operation (in minutes). Results Among 68 randomized patients, 60 (88%) completed the trial (median age, 64 [interquartile range {IQR}, 57-70] years; 26 [43%] women). The median length of surgery was 256 minutes (IQR, 213-430 minutes). The median time-weighted average of hypotension was 0.10 mm Hg (IQR, 0.01-0.43 mm Hg) in the intervention group vs 0.44 mm Hg (IQR, 0.23-0.72 mm Hg) in the control group, for a median difference of 0.38 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.14-0.43 mm Hg; P = .001). The median time of hypotension per patient was 8.0 minutes (IQR, 1.33-26.00 minutes) in the intervention group vs 32.7 minutes (IQR, 11.5-59.7 minutes) in the control group, for a median difference of 16.7 minutes (95% CI, 7.7-31.0 minutes; P < .001). In the intervention group, 0 serious adverse events resulting in death occurred vs 2 (7%) in the control group. Conclusions and Relevance In this single-center preliminary study of patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, the use of a machine learning-derived early warning system compared with standard care resulted in less intraoperative hypotension. Further research with larger study populations in diverse settings is needed to understand the effect on additional patient outcomes and to fully assess safety and generalizability.

In particular, clustering helps at analyzing unstructured and high-dimensional data in the form of sequences, expressions, texts and images. Further, clustering is used to gain insights into biological processes in the genomics level, e.g. clustering of gene expressions provides insights on the natural structure inherent in the data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, subtypes of cells and understanding gene regulations. Subsequently, clustering approaches, including hierarchical, centroid-based, distribution-based, density-based and self-organizing maps, have long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings. In contrast, deep learning (DL)-based representation and feature learning for clustering have not been reviewed and employed extensively. Since the quality of clustering is not only dependent on the distribution of data points but also on the learned representation, deep neural networks can be effective means to transform mappings from a high-dimensional data space into a lower-dimensional feature space, leading to improved clustering results. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art DL-based approaches for cluster analysis that are based on representation learning, which we hope to be useful, particularly for bioinformatics research. Further, we explore in detail the training procedures of DL-based clustering algorithms, point out different clustering quality metrics and evaluate several DL-based approaches on three bioinformatics use cases, including bioimaging, cancer genomics and biomedical text mining. We believe this review and the evaluation results will provide valuable insights and serve a starting point for researchers wanting to apply DL-based unsupervised methods to solve emerging bioinformatics research problems.

J	Gao, JH; Song, ZH; Gui, JY; Yuan, SY				Gao, Jianhu; Song, Zhaohui; Gui, Jinyong; Yuan, Sanyi			Gas-Bearing Prediction Using Transfer Learning and CNNs: An Application to a Deep Tight Dolomite Reservoir	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Reservoirs; Training; Feature extraction; Data models; Convolution; Numerical models; Mathematical model; Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); deep tight dolomite reservoir; gas prediction; prestack seismic data; transfer learning	IMPEDANCE INVERSION	Predicting gas-bearing zone of deep tight dolomite reservoirs from prestack seismic data is challenging and subject to great uncertainty. Machine learning especially for deep learning (DL) provides a new potential. One main limitation of the DL-based supervised methods is that they require large amounts of training data. However, well-log labels from the real deep reservoirs are very insufficient. To address this issue, we investigate a method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) considering transfer learning to predict gas distribution of deep tight dolomite reservoirs. The CNNs model we used contains three convolutional layers for automatic feature extraction from prestack data and one fully connected (FC) layer for gas-bearing probability prediction. A numerical model is designed based on petrophysical parameters extracted from the real target work area associated with deep tight dolomite reservoirs. The model is used to generate synthetic samples to pretrain the CNNs model. We then fix the network parameters in the first two convolutional layers and decay the learning rates of the third convolutional layer and the FC layer. Using the real samples to fine-tune the pretrained CNNs model with epoch increasing. The optimal predictor is finally trained well for gas-bearing prediction. The method is applied to a real work area of deep tight dolomite reservoir located in western China covering approximately 800 km(2). Examples illustrate the roles of transfer learning on improving gas-bearing distribution of deep tight dolomite reservoirs and increasing the generalization of the method.

Slope stability prediction for circular mode failure using gradient boosting machine approach based on an updated database of case histories	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						Slope stability; Circular failure; Gradient boosting machine (GBM); Predictive modeling; Mine safety	LIMIT EQUILIBRIUM; SYSTEMS; DAMAGE	Prediction of slope stability is one of the most crucial tasks in mining and geotechnical engineering projects. The accuracy of the prediction is very important for mitigating the risk of slope instability and enhancing mine safety in preliminary design. However, existing methods such as traditional statistical learning models are unable to provide accurate results for slope instability due to the complexity and uncertainties of multiple related factors with small unbalanced data samples thus requiring complex data processing algorithms. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel prediction method that utilizes the gradient boosting machine (GBM) method to analyze slope stability. The GBM-based model is developed by the freely available R Environment software, trained and tested with the parameters obtained from the detailed investigation of 221 different actual slope cases between 1994 and 2011 with circular mode failure available in the literature. The stability of the circular slope accounts for the unit weight (gamma), cohesion (c), angle of internal friction (phi), slope angle (beta), slope height (H) and pore water pressure coefficient (ru). A fivefold cross-validation procedure is implemented to determine the optimal parameter values during the GBM modeling and an external testing set is employed to validate the prediction performance of models. Area under the curve (AUC), classification accuracy rate and Cohen's Kappa coefficient have been employed for measuring the performance of the proposed model. The analysis of AUC, accuracy together with kappa for the dataset demonstrate that the GBM model has high credibility as it achieves a comparable AUC, classification accuracy rate and Cohen's kappa values of 0.900, 0.8654 and 0.7324, respectively for the prediction of slope stability. Also, variable importance and partial dependence plots are used to interpret the complex relationships between the GBM predictive results and predictor variables.

We created a geographic information system database, and our analysis results were used to prepare a landslide inventory map containing 359 landslide events identified from Google Earth, aerial photographs, and other validated sources. A support vector regression (SVR) machine-learning model was used to divide the landslide inventory into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. The landslide susceptibility map was produced using 14 causative factors. We applied the established gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm, bat algorithm(BA), and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) to fine-tune the parameters of the SVR model to improve its predictive accuracy. The resultant hybrid models, SVR-GWO, SVR-BA, and SVR-COA, were validated in terms of the area under curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The AUC values for the SVR-GWO (0.733), SVR-BA (0.724), and SVR-COA (0.738) models indicate their good prediction rates for landslide susceptibility modeling. SVR-COA had the greatest accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.21687, and SVR-BA had the least accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.23046. The three optimized hybrid models outperformed the SVR model (AUC = 0.704, RMSE = 0.26689), confirming the ability of metaheuristic algorithms to improve model performance.

J	Bolton, T; Zanna, L				Bolton, Thomas; Zanna, Laure			Applications of Deep Learning to Ocean Data Inference and Subgrid Parameterization	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							SOUTHERN-OCEAN; GULF-STREAM; EDDY; RESOLUTION; TEMPERATURE; SUBSURFACE; VISCOSITY; TRANSPORT; CLIMATE; IMPACT	Oceanographic observations are limited by sampling rates, while ocean models are limited by finite resolution and high viscosity and diffusion coefficients. Therefore, both data from observations and ocean models lack information at small and fast scales. Methods are needed to either extract information, extrapolate, or upscale existing oceanographic data sets, to account for or represent unresolved physical processes. Here we use machine learning to leverage observations and model data by predicting unresolved turbulent processes and subsurface flow fields. As a proof of concept, we train convolutional neural networks on degraded data from a high-resolution quasi-geostrophic ocean model. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks successfully replicate the spatiotemporal variability of the subgrid eddy momentum forcing, are capable of generalizing to a range of dynamical behaviors, and can be forced to respect global momentum conservation. The training data of our convolutional neural networks can be subsampled to 10-20% of the original size without a significant decrease in accuracy. We also show that the subsurface flow field can be predicted using only information at the surface (e.g., using only satellite altimetry data). Our results indicate that data-driven approaches can be exploited to predict both subgrid and large-scale processes, while respecting physical principles, even when data are limited to a particular region or external forcing. Our in-depth study presents evidence for the successful design of ocean eddy parameterizations for implementation in coarse-resolution climate models. Plain Language Summary Models of the ocean and ocean observations are imperfect. Due to this imperfection, simulations of the ocean and our observations are not quite the same as the true ocean currents. We, therefore, need ways to make our ocean data more realistic and complete and to make it more similar to the actual ocean. Scientists have traditionally approached this problem in a pen-and-paper style, considering physical theories and mechanisms. This study instead uses machine learning, which focuses on data as opposed to equations on a black board. We successfully use a particular type of machine learning algorithm, called a convolutional neural network, to make the most of current oceanographic data. This type of neural network works well even if ocean data are limited to a particular area. Future work will involve combining machine learning with physical theories of the ocean.

However, new advancements in statistical and machine learning algorithms continuously being updated the landslide susceptibility paradigm. This paper explores the predictive performance power of different sampling techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping in the wake of increased usage of artificial intelligence. We used logistic regression (LR), neural network (NNET), and deep learning neural network (DNN) model for testing and validation of the models. The tests were applied to the 2018 Hokkaido Earthquake affected areas using a set of 11 predictor variables (seismic, topographic, and hydrological). We found that the prediction rates are inconsequential with the DNN model irrespective of the sampling technique (AUC: 0.904 - 0.919). Whereas, testing with LR (AUC: 0.825 - 0.785) and NNET (AUC: 0.882 - 0.858) produces larger differences in the accuracies between the four datasets. Nonetheless, the highest success rates were obtained for samples within the landslide scarp area. The analogy was then validated with a published landslide inventory from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. We, therefore, suggest that DNN models as an appropriate technique to increase the predictive performance of landslide susceptibilities if the landslide scarp and body are not characterized properly in an inventory.

This part of the Ganga floodplain region, which under the influence of undergoing active tectonic regime related subsidence, is the hotbed of annual flood disaster. This makes the region one of the best natural laboratories to test the flood susceptibility models for establishing a universalization of such models in low relief highly flood prone areas. Based on highly sophisticated flood inventory archived for this region, and 12 flood conditioning factors viz. annual rainfall, soil type, stream density, distance from stream, distance from road, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), altitude, slope aspect, slope, curvature, land use/land cover, and geomorphology, an advanced novel hybrid model Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and three metaheuristic models-based ensembles with ANFIS namely ANFIS-GA (Genetic Algorithm), ANFIS-DE (Differential Evolution), and ANFIS-PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), have been applied for zonation of the flood susceptible areas. The flood inventory dataset, prepared by collected flood samples, were apportioned into 70:30 classes to prepare training and validation datasets. One independent validation method, the Area-Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) Curve, and other 11 cut-off-dependent model evaluation metrices have helped to conclude that the ANIFS-GA has outperformed other three models with highest success rate AUC = 0.922 and prediction rate AUC = 0.924. The accuracy was also found to be highest for ANFIS-GA during training (0.886) & validation (0.883). Better performance of ANIFS-GA than the individual models as well as some ensemble models suggests andwarrants further study in this topoclimatic environment using other classes of susceptibility models. This will further help establishing a benchmark model with capability of highest accuracy and sensitivity performance in the similar topographic and climatic setting taking assumption of the quality of input parameters as constant.

The aim of this paper is to guide medical practitioners on the relevant aspects of artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning, and deep learning, to review the development of technological advancement equipped with AI, and to elucidate how machine learning can revolutionize the management of neurological diseases. This review focuses on unsupervised aspects of machine learning, and how these aspects could be applied to precision neurology to improve patient outcomes. We have mentioned various forms of available AI, prior research, outcomes, benefits and limitations of AI, effective accessibility and future of AI, keeping the current burden of neurological disorders in mind. Discussion The smart device system to monitor tremors and to recognize its phenotypes for better outcomes of deep brain stimulation, applications evaluating fine motor functions, AI integrated electroencephalogram learning to diagnose epilepsy and psychological non-epileptic seizure, predict outcome of seizure surgeries, recognize patterns of autonomic instability to prevent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), identify the pattern of complex algorithm in neuroimaging classifying cognitive impairment, differentiating and classifying concussion phenotypes, smartwatches monitoring atrial fibrillation to prevent strokes, and prediction of prognosis in dementia are unique examples of experimental utilizations of AI in the field of neurology. Though there are obvious limitations of AI, the general consensus among several nationwide studies is that this new technology has the ability to improve the prognosis of neurological disorders and as a result should become a staple in the medical community. Conclusion AI not only helps to analyze medical data in disease prevention, diagnosis, patient monitoring, and development of new protocols, but can also assist clinicians in dealing with voluminous data in a more accurate and efficient manner.

Various kinds of technologies have been proposed to address this problem, such as mathematical analysis, machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, and precursors signal study. Unfortunately, they usually do not have very good results due to the seemingly dynamic and unpredictable nature of earthquakes. In contrast, we notice that earthquakes are spatially and temporally correlated because of the crust movement. Therefore, earthquake prediction for a particular location should not be conducted only based on the history data in that location, but according to the history data in a larger area. In this paper, we employ a deep learning technique called long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the spatio-temporal relationship among earthquakes in different locations and make predictions by taking advantage of that relationship. Simulation results show that the LSTM network with two-dimensional input developed in this paper is able to discover and exploit the spatio-temporal correlations among earthquakes to make better predictions than before.

This manuscript introduces matminer, an open-source, Python-based software platform to facilitate data-driven methods of analyzing and predicting materials properties. Matminer provides modules for retrieving large data sets from external databases such as the Materials Project, Citrination, Materials Data Facility, and Materials Platform for Data Science. It also provides implementations for an extensive library of feature extraction routines developed by the materials community, with 47 featurization classes that can generate thousands of individual descriptors and combine them into mathematical functions. Finally, matminer provides a visualization module for producing interactive, shareable plots. These functions are designed in a way that integrates closely with machine learning and data analysis packages already developed and in use by the Python data science community. We explain the structure and logic of matminer, provide a description of its various modules, and showcase several examples of how matminer can be used to collect data, reproduce data mining studies reported in the literature, and test new methodologies.

In this paper, a machine learning prediction model driven by experimental data is developed and applied to predict the power output of single screw expander. After screening different structural parameters of the model, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of the model, so as to further improve the generalization ability of the model. In addition, the generalization ability of the model is compared with that of the model not optimized by GA. Furthermore, the influence of operating parameters on the power output of single screw expander is analyzed by fitting algorithm in three-dimensional space. The optimization boundary value needed for prediction and optimization is determined by fitting algorithm in four-dimensional space. Finally, a prediction and optimization model is created by coupling the machine learning prediction model with GA, and the maximum power output and corresponding operating parameters of the single screw expander under full operating conditions are predicted and optimized. The results show that with the application of machine learning and GA, the maximum power output of single screw expander can be predicted and optimized precisely under full operating conditions. So as to directly guide the selection of relevant parameters in the process of theoretical analysis and experimental research.

Although significant progress has been achieved, existing approaches usually overlook aligning specific labels and their corresponding regions due to the weak supervised information (i.e., ``bag of labels'' for regions), thus failing to explicitly exploit the discrimination from different classes. In this article, we propose the deep label-specific feature (Deep-LIFT) learning model to build the explicit and exact correspondence between the label and the local visual region, which improves the effectiveness of feature learning and enhances the interpretability of the model itself. Deep-LIFT extracts features for each label by aligning each label and its region. Specifically, Deep-LIFTs are achieved through learning multiple correlation maps between image convolutional features and label embeddings. Moreover, we construct two variant graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to further capture the interdependency among labels. Empirical studies on benchmark datasets validate that the proposed model achieves superior performance on multilabel classification over other existing state-of-the-art methods.

J	Morley, J; Floridi, L; Kinsey, L; Elhalal, A				Morley, Jessica; Floridi, Luciano; Kinsey, Libby; Elhalal, Anat			From What to How: An Initial Review of Publicly Available AI Ethics Tools, Methods and Research to Translate Principles into Practices	SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Applied ethics; Data governance; Digital ethics; Governance; Ethics of AI; Machine learning	DECISION-MAKING; PRIVACY; DESIGN; RESPONSIBILITY; EXPLANATION; FUTURE	The debate about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence dates from the 1960s (Samuel in Science, 132(3429):741-742, 1960. 10.1126/science.132.3429.741; Wiener in Cybernetics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, MIT Press, New York, 1961). However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles-the 'what' of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)-rather than on practices, the 'how.' Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community's ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs.

With ad-vances in machine learning technologies, automated faulty condition identification can be ach-ieved by training an artificial intelligent (AI) model if sufficient data is available. In most practical applications, it is unlikely that enough data from faulty cases are available for supervised training of AI models for anomaly detection. This work is based on training data that are exclusively constituted of healthy signals (i.e., semi-supervised) and aims to develop an automated algorithm capable of identifying any abnormal mechanical behaviour captured by vibration measurements. A deep learning method with long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures combined with a one-class support vector machine (SVM) is used to separate abnormal data from normal vibration signals collected during an endurance test of a reduction gearbox and helicopter test flight data measured by multiple sensors situated at different locations of the aircraft. For the gearbox dataset, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms by which different types of faults (gear wear and bearing faults) affect the vibration signal led to the design of two anomaly detection architectures: i) an LSTM regression + one-class SVM for detecting new deterministic components introduced by gear faults; and ii) a two-step LSTM regression + one-class SVM for detecting new random components caused by bearing failures. For the helicopter dataset, which does not contain consecutive time-series, we show that the LSTM regression is not advantageous, and a better performance can be achieved by a simpler one-class SVM outlier detection based on statistical features. This work contributes to the field of machine condition monitoring by introducing a novel two-step LSTM configuration for removing deterministic components asso-ciated with dominant gear signals in the first step and removing the 'residual deterministic' components associated with varying gear signals in the second step.

In the past decades, the world's energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions increased rapidly due to the increases in population and comfort demands of people. Building energy consumption prediction is essential for energy planning, management, and conservation. Data-driven models provide a practical approach to energy consumption prediction. This paper offers a review of the studies that developed data-driven building energy consumption prediction models, with a particular focus on reviewing the scopes of prediction, the data properties and the data preprocessing methods used, the machine learning algorithms utilized for prediction, and the performance measures used for evaluation. Based on this review, existing research gaps are identified and future research directions in the area of data-driven building energy consumption prediction are highlighted.

Due to the large number of infected patients and heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT) has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability. Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the case of directly projecting high-dimensional features into classes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the number of training data.

Insightful classification of crystal structures using deep learning	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; AFLOWLIB.ORG	Computational methods that automatically extract knowledge from data are critical for enabling data-driven materials science. A reliable identification of lattice symmetry is a crucial first step for materials characterization and analytics. Current methods require a user-specified threshold, and are unable to detect average symmetries for defective structures. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically classify structures by crystal symmetry. First, we represent crystals by calculating a diffraction image, then construct a deep learning neural network model for classification. Our approach is able to correctly classify a dataset comprising more than 100,000 simulated crystal structures, including heavily defective ones. The internal operations of the neural network are unraveled through attentive response maps, demonstrating that it uses the same landmarks a materials scientist would use, although never explicitly instructed to do so. Our study paves the way for crystal structure recognition of-possibly noisy and incomplete-three-dimensional structural data in big-data materials science.

Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide "obviously" interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.

This is made possible by combining advanced free-energy methods and state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques. The ab initio description leads to structural properties in excellent agreement with experiments and reliable estimates of the melting points of light and heavy water. We observe that nuclear-quantum effects contribute a crucial 0.2 meV/H2O to the stability of ice Ih, making it more stable than ice Ic. Our computational approach is general and transferable, providing a comprehensive framework for quantitative predictions of ab initio thermodynamic properties using machine-learning potentials as an intermediate step.

IoT enabled depthwise separable convolution neural network with deep support vector machine for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						COVID-19; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Feature extraction; Multilabel classification		At present times, the drastic advancements in the 5G cellular and internet of things (IoT) technologies find useful in different applications of the healthcare sector. At the same time, COVID-19 is commonly spread from animals to persons, but today it is transmitting among persons by adapting the structure. It is a severe virus and inappropriately resulted in a global pandemic. Radiologists utilize X-ray or computed tomography (CT) images to diagnose COVID-19 disease. It is essential to identify and classify the disease through the use of image processing techniques. So, a new intelligent disease diagnosis model is in need to identify the COVID-19. In this view, this paper presents a novel IoT enabled Depthwise separable convolution neural network (DWS-CNN) with Deep support vector machine (DSVM) for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification. The proposed DWS-CNN model aims to detect both binary and multiple classes of COVID-19 by incorporating a set of processes namely data acquisition, Gaussian filtering (GF) based preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, patient data will be collected in the data acquisition stage using IoT devices and sent to the cloud server. Besides, the GF technique is applied to remove the existence of noise that exists in the image. Then, the DWS-CNN model is employed for replacing default convolution for automatic feature extraction. Finally, the DSVM model is applied to determine the binary and multiple class labels of COVID-19. The diagnostic outcome of the DWS-CNN model is tested against Chest X-ray (CXR) image dataset and the results are investigated interms of distinct performance measures. The experimental results ensured the superior results of the DWS-CNN model by attaining maximum classification performance with the accuracy of 98.54% and 99.06% on binary and multiclass respectively.

Automated deep learning-based paradigm for high-risk plaque detection in B-mode common carotid ultrasound scans: an asymptomatic Japanese cohort study	INTERNATIONAL ANGIOLOGY			English	Article						Stroke; Cardiovascular diseases; Carotid arteries; Ultrasonography; Deep learning	LUMEN DIAMETER MEASUREMENT; INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS; TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION; ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE; SCALE-SPACE; CLASSIFICATION; DISEASE; STRATIFICATION; SCORE; AREA	Background: The death due to stroke is caused by embolism of the arteries which is due to the rupture of the atherosclerotic lesions in carotid arteries. The lesion formation is over time, and thus, early screening is recommended for asymptomatic and moderate-risk patients. The previous techniques adopted conventional methods or semi-automated and, more recently, machine learning solutions. A handful of studies have emerged based on solo deep learning (SDL) models such as UNet architecture. Methods: The proposed research is the first to adopt hybrid deep learning (HDL) artificial intelligence models such as SegNet-UNet. This model is benchmarked against UNet and advanced conventional models using scale-space such as AtheroEdge 2.0 (AtheroPoint, CA, USA). All our resultant statistics of the three systems were in the order of UNet, SegNet-UNet, and AtheroEdge 2.0. Results: Using the database of 379 ultrasound scans from a Japanese cohort of 190 patients having moderate risk and implementing the cross-validation deep learning framework, our system performance using area under-the-curve (AUC) for UNet, SegNet-UNet, and AtheroEdge 2.0 were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95 (P<0.001), respectively. The coefficient of correlation between the three systems and ground truth (GT) were: 0.82, 0.89, and 0.85 (P<0.001 for all three), respectively. The mean absolute area error for the three systems against manual GT was 4.07 +/- 4.70 mm(2), 3.11 +/- 3.92 mm(2), 3.72 +/- 4.76 mm(2), respectively, proving the superior performance SegNet-UNet against UNet and AtheroEdge 2.0, respectively. Statistical tests were also conducted for their reliability and stability.

Hybrid Deep-Learning-Based Anomaly Detection Scheme for Suspicious Flow Detection in SDN: A Social Multimedia Perspective	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						Anomaly detection; deep learning; flow routing; software defined networks; social multimedia	SOFTWARE-DEFINED-NETWORKING; INTRUSION DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; THREATS; SYSTEM	The continuous development and usage of multimedia-based applications and services have contributed to the exponential growth of social multimedia traffic. In this context, secure transmission of data plays a critical role in realizing all of the key requirements of social multimedia networks such as reliability, scalability, quality of information, and quality of service (QoS). Thus, a trust-based paradigm for multimedia analytics is highly desired to meet the increasing user requirements and deliver more timely and actionable insights. In this regard, software-defined networks (SDNs) play a vital role; however, several factors such as as-runtime security, and energy-aware networking limit its capabilities to facilitate efficient network control and management. Thus, with the view to enhance the reliability of the SDN, a hybrid deep-learning-based anomaly detection scheme for suspicious flow detection in the context of social multimedia is proposed. It consists of the following two modules: 1) an anomaly detection module that leverages improved restricted Boltzmann machine and gradient descent-based support vector machine to detect the abnormal activities, and 2) an end-to-end data delivery module to satisfy strict QoS requirements of the SDN, that is, high bandwidth and low latency. Finally, the proposed scheme has been experimentally evaluated on both real-time and benchmark datasets to prove its effectiveness and efficiency in terms of anomaly detection and data delivery essential for social multimedia. Further, a large-scale analysis over a Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)-based insider threat dataset has been conducted to identify its performance in terms of detecting malicious events such as-Identity theft, profile cloning, confidential data collection, etc.	[Garg, Sahil; Kaur, Kuljeet] Univ Quebec, Dept Elect Engn, Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Kumar, Neeraj] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol Deemed Be Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Patiala 147003, Punjab, India; [Rodrigues, Joel J.

Although machine learning-based models have achieved high performance in terms of prediction accuracy, overfitting is a common risk for such highly parameterized models. Here we show that overfitting can be minimized when RNA folding scores learnt using a deep neural network are integrated together with Turner's nearest-neighbor free energy parameters. Training the model with thermodynamic regularization ensures that folding scores and the calculated free energy are as close as possible. In computational experiments designed for newly discovered non-coding RNAs, our algorithm (MXfold2) achieves the most robust and accurate predictions of RNA secondary structures without sacrificing computational efficiency compared to several other algorithms. The results suggest that integrating thermodynamic information could help improve the robustness of deep learning-based predictions of RNA secondary structure. Accurately predicting the secondary structure of non-coding RNAs can help unravel their function. Here the authors propose a method integrating thermodynamic information and deep learning to improve the robustness of RNA secondary structure prediction compared to several existing algorithms.

In this study, we use eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-a Machine Learning (ML) technique-to detect the occurrence of accidents using a set of real time data comprised of traffic, network, demographic, land use, and weather features. The data used from the Chicago metropolitan expressways was collected between December 2016 and December 2017, and it includes 244 traffic accidents and 6073 non-accident cases. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) is employed to interpret the results and analyze the importance of individual features. The results show that XGBoost can detect accidents robustly with an accuracy, detection rate, and a false alarm rate of 99 %, 79 %, and 0.16 %, respectively. Several traffic related features, especially difference of speed between 5 min before and 5 min after an accident, are found to have relatively more impact on the occurrence of accidents. Furthermore, a feature dependency analysis is conducted for three pairs of features. First, average daily traffic and speed after accidents/non-accidents time at the upstream location are interpreted jointly. Then, distance to Central Business District and residential density are analyzed. Finally, speed after accidents/non-accidents time at upstream location and speed after accidents/non-accidents time at downstream location are evaluated with respect to the model's output.

Due to privacy concerns of preventing disclosing sensitive information, data owners often suppress their data for an untrusted trainer to train a classifier. Some existing work proposed privacy-preserving solutions for learning algorithms, which allow a trainer to build a classifier over the data from a single owner. However, they cannot be directly used in the multi-owner setting where each owner is not totally trusted for each other. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy preserving Naive Bayes learning scheme with multiple data sources. The proposed scheme enables a trainer to train a Naive Bayes classifier over the dataset provided jointly by different data owners, without the help of a trusted curator. The training result can achieve is an element of-differential privacy while the training will not break the privacy of each owner. We implement the prototype of the scheme and conduct corresponding experiment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The adoption of DL in hydrology has so far been gradual, but the field is now ripe for breakthroughs. This paper suggests that DLbased methods can open up a complementary avenue toward knowledge discovery in hydrologic sciences. In the new avenue, machine-learning algorithms present competing hypotheses that are consistent with data. Interrogative methods are then invoked to interpret DL models for scientists to further evaluate. However, hydrology presents many challenges for DL methods, such as data limitations, heterogeneity and co-evolution, and the general inexperience of the hydrologic field with DL. The roadmap toward DL-powered scientific advances will require the coordinated effort from a large community involving scientists and citizens. Integrating process-based models with DL models will help alleviate data limitations. The sharing of data and baseline models will improve the efficiency of the community as a whole. Open competitions could serve as the organizing events to greatly propel growth and nurture data science education in hydrology, which demands a grassroots collaboration. The area of hydrologic DL presents numerous research opportunities that could, in turn, stimulate advances in machine learning as well.

There are many types of promoters in bacteria with important roles in initiating gene transcription. Therefore, solving promoter-identification problems has important implications for improving the understanding of their functions. To this end, computational methods targeting promoter classification have been established; however, their performance remains unsatisfactory. In this study, we present a novel stacked-ensemble approach (termed SELECTOR) for identifying both promoters and their respective classification. SELECTOR combined the composition of k-spaced nucleic acid pairs, parallel correlation pseudo-dinucleotide composition, position-specific trinucleotide propensity based on single-strand, and DNA strand features and using five popular tree-based ensemble learning algorithms to build a stacked model. Both 5-fold cross-validation tests using benchmark datasets and independent tests using the newly collected independent test dataset showed that SELECTOR outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both general and specific types of promoter prediction in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, this novel framework provides essential interpretations that aid understanding of model success by leveraging the powerful Shapley Additive exPlanation algorithm, thereby highlighting the most important features relevant for predicting both general and specific types of promoters and overcoming the limitations of existing `Black-box' approaches that are unable to reveal causal relationships from large amounts of initially encoded features.

J	Sun, LN; Gao, H; Pan, SW; Wang, JX				Sun, Luning; Gao, Han; Pan, Shaowu; Wang, Jian-Xun			Surrogate modeling for fluid flows based on physics-constrained deep learning without simulation data	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Physics-informed machine learning; Label-free; Neural networks; Uncertainty quantification; Cardiovascular flows; Navier-Stokes	NEURAL-NETWORKS; POLYNOMIAL CHAOS; REDUCTION; ALGORITHM	Numerical simulations on fluid dynamics problems primarily rely on spatially or/and temporally discretization of the governing equation using polynomials into a finite-dimensional algebraic system. Due to the multi-scale nature of the physics and sensitivity from meshing a complicated geometry, such process can be computational prohibitive for most real-time applications (e.g., clinical diagnosis and surgery planning) and many-query analyses (e.g., optimization design and uncertainty quantification). Therefore, developing a cost-effective surrogate model is of great practical significance. Deep learning (DL) has shown new promises for surrogate modeling due to its capability of handling strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality. However, the off-the-shelf DL architectures, success of which heavily relies on the large amount of training data and interpolatory nature of the problem, fail to operate when the data becomes sparse. Unfortunately, data is often insufficient in most parametric fluid dynamics problems since each data point in the parameter space requires an expensive numerical simulation based on the first principle, e.g., Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, we provide a physics-constrained DL approach for surrogate modeling of fluid flows without relying on any simulation data. Specifically, a structured deep neural network (DNN) architecture is devised to enforce the initial and boundary conditions, and the governing partial differential equations (i.e., Navier-Stokes equations) are incorporated into the loss of the DNN to drive the training. Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of internal flows relevant to hemodynamics applications, and the forward propagation of uncertainties in fluid properties and domain geometry is studied as well. The results show excellent agreement on the flow field and forward-propagated uncertainties between the DL surrogate approximations and the first-principle numerical simulations.

Approaching coupled cluster accuracy with a general-purpose neural network potential through transfer learning	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; FORCE-FIELD; MACHINE; CHEMISTRY; DISCOVERY; ENERGIES; MODEL; SET	Computational modeling of chemical and biological systems at atomic resolution is a crucial tool in the chemist's toolset. The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

In particular, this work has explored what fairness might mean in the context of decisions based on the predictions of statistical and machine learning models. The rapid growth of this new field has led to wildly inconsistent motivations, terminology, and notation, presenting a serious challenge for cataloging and comparing definitions. This article attempts to bring much-needed order. First, we explicate the various choices and assumptions made-often implicitly-to justify the use of prediction-based decision-making. Next, we show how such choices and assumptions can raise fairness concerns and we present a notationally consistent catalog of fairness definitions from the literature. In doing so, we offer a concise reference for thinking through the choices, assumptions, and fairness considerations of prediction-based decision-making.

Machine learning (ML) belongs to the area of AI and endeavors to develop models from exposure to training data. Deep Learning (DL) is another subset of AI, where models represent geometric transformations over many different layers. This technology has shown tremendous potential in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. More recently, DL has also been successfully applied in drug discovery. Here, I analyze several relevant DL applications and case studies, providing a detailed view of the current state-of-the-art in drug discovery and highlighting not only the problematic issues, but also the successes and opportunities for further advances.

Because an SHM system implemented into a structure automatically senses, evaluates, and warns about structural conditions in real time, massive data are a significant feature of SHM. The techniques related to massive data are referred to as data science and engineering, and include acquisition techniques, transition techniques, management techniques, and processing and mining algorithms for massive data. This paper provides a brief review of the state of the art of data science and engineering in SHM as investigated by these authors, and covers the compressive sampling-based data-acquisition algorithm, the anomaly data diagnosis approach using a deep learning algorithm, crack identification approaches using computer vision techniques, and condition assessment approaches for bridges using machine learning algorithms. Future trends are discussed in the conclusion. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Higher Education Press Limited Company.

However, the valuable information in the raw data may be filtered with the layer-wise feature compression in traditional deep networks. This cannot benefit for the subsequent fine-tuning phase of fault classification. To alleviate this problem, an extended deep belief network (EDBN) is proposed to fully exploit useful information in the raw data, in which raw data is combined with the hidden features as inputs to each extended restricted Boltzmann machine (ERBM) during the pre-training phase. Then, a dynamic EDBN-based fault classifier is constructed to take the dynamic characteristics of process data into consideration. Finally, to test the performance of the proposed method, it is applied to the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process for fault classification. By comparing EDBN and DBN under different network structures, the results show that EDBN has better feature extraction and fault classification performance than traditional DBN. (C) 2019 ISA.

Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Data-driven scientific computing; Machine learning; Predictive modeling; Runge-Kutta methods; Nonlinear dynamics	INFORMATION; ALGORITHMS	We introduce physics-informed neural networks - neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction-diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.

Existing research shows that deep learning (DL) algorithms have been successfully used by researchers to identify COVID-19 phenomena from raw data obtained from medical IoT devices. Some examples of IoT technology are radiological media, such as CT scanning and X-ray images, body temperature measurement using thermal cameras, safe social distancing identification using live face detection, and face mask detection from camera images. However, researchers have identified several security vulnerabilities in DL algorithms to adversarial perturbations. In this article, we have tested a number of COVID-19 diagnostic methods that rely on DL algorithms with relevant adversarial examples (AEs). Our test results show that DL models that do not consider defensive models against adversarial perturbations remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Finally, we present in detail the AE generation process, implementation of the attack model, and the perturbations of the existing DL-based COVID-19 diagnostic applications. We hope that this work will raise awareness of adversarial attacks and encourages others to safeguard DL models from attacks on healthcare systems.

Early detection of hypertension and diabetes is extremely important, as these chronic diseases often result in life-threatening complications when found at a later stage. This work proposes a smart home health monitoring system that helps to analyze the patient's blood pressure and glucose readings at home and notifies the healthcare provider in case of any abnormality detected. A combination of conditional decision-making and machine-learning approaches is used to predict hypertension and diabetes status, respectively. The goal is to predict the hypertension and diabetes status using the patient's glucose and blood pressure readings. Using supervised machine learning classification algorithms, herein a system is trained to predict the patient's diabetes and hypertension status. After analyzing all the classification algorithms, support vector machine classification algorithm was found to be most accurate and thus chosen to train the model. This proposed work develops an application for a home health monitoring system with a user-friendly easy-to-use graphical user interface to diagnose blood pressure and diabetes status of patients along with sending categorized alerts and real-time notifications to their registered physician or clinic all from home.

Recent advances in SOD are predominantly led by deep learning-based solutions (named deep SOD). To enable in-depth understanding of deep SOD, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey covering various aspects, ranging from algorithm taxonomy to unsolved issues. In particular, we first review deep SOD algorithms from different perspectives, including network architecture, level of supervision, learning paradigm, and object-/instance-level detection. Following that, we summarize and analyze existing SOD datasets and evaluation metrics. Then, we benchmark a large group of representative SOD models, and provide detailed analyses of the comparison results. Moreover, we study the performance of SOD algorithms under different attribute settings, which has not been thoroughly explored previously, by constructing a novel SOD dataset with rich attribute annotations covering various salient object types, challenging factors, and scene categories. We further analyze, for the first time in the field, the robustness of SOD models to random input perturbations and adversarial attacks. We also look into the generalization and difficulty of existing SOD datasets. Finally, we discuss several open issues of SOD and outline future research directions. All the saliency prediction maps, our constructed dataset with annotations, and codes for evaluation are publicly available at https://github.com/wenguanwang/SODsurvey.

To learn this quantitative relationship, hundreds of molecular descriptors have been designed to describe the structure, mainly based on the properties of vertices and edges of molecular graph. However, many descriptors degenerate to the same values for different compounds with the same molecular graph, resulting in model failure. In this paper, we design a multidimensional signal for each vertex of the molecular graph to derive new descriptors with higher discriminability. We treat the new and traditional descriptors as the signals on the descriptor graph learned from the descriptor data, and enhance descriptor dissimilarity using the Laplacian filter derived from the descriptor graph. Combining these with model learning techniques, we propose a graph signal processing based approach to obtain reliable new models for learning the quantitative relationship and predicting the properties of compounds. We also provide insights from chemistry for the boiling point model. Several experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity, effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.

However, in situ learning on a large-scale multiple-layer memristor network has yet to be demonstrated because of challenges in device property engineering and circuit integration. Here we monolithically integrate hafnium oxide-based memristors with a foundrymade transistor array into a multiple-layer neural network. We experimentally demonstrate in situ learning capability and achieve competitive classification accuracy on a standard machine learning dataset, which further confirms that the training algorithm allows the network to adapt to hardware imperfections. Our simulation using the experimental parameters suggests that a larger network would further increase the classification accuracy. The memristor neural network is a promising hardware platform for artificial intelligence with high speed-energy efficiency.

In this study, we combine convolutional and recurrent architectures to train a deep network to predict colorectal cancer outcome based on images of tumour tissue samples. The novelty of our approach is that we directly predict patient outcome, without any intermediate tissue classification. We evaluate a set of digitized haematoxylin-eosin-stained tumour tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 420 colorectal cancer patients with clinicopathological and outcome data available. The results show that deep learning-based outcome prediction with only small tissue areas as input outperforms (hazard ratio 2.3; CI 95% 1.79-3.03; AUC 0.69) visual histological assessment performed by human experts on both TMA spot (HR 1.67; CI 95% 1.28-2.19; AUC 0.58) and whole-slide level (HR 1.65; CI 95% 1.30-2.15; AUC 0.57) in the stratification into low-and high-risk patients. Our results suggest that state-of-the-art deep learning techniques can extract more prognostic information from the tissue morphology of colorectal cancer than an experienced human observer.

Recommendations are made for original contributions to the literature, as opposed to formulaic applications of established methods to new application areas (e.g., to new crops), including the use of standard metrics (e.g., F1 score, the harmonic mean between Precision and Recall) for model comparison involving binary classification. A recommendation for the provision and use of publically available fruit-in-orchard image sets is made, to allow method comparisons and for implementation of transfer learning for deep learning models trained on the large public generic datasets. Emphasis is placed on practical aspects for application of deep learning models for the task of fruit detection and localisation, in support of tree crop load estimation. Approaches to the extrapolation of tree image counts to orchard yield estimation are also reviewed, dealing with the issue of occluded fruit in imaging. The review is intended to assist new users of deep learning image processing techniques, and to influence the direction of the coming body of application work on fruit detection.

J	Yang, JC; Zhang, JP; Wang, HH				Yang, Jiachen; Zhang, Jipeng; Wang, Huihui			Urban Traffic Control in Software Defined Internet of Things via a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Machine learning; Feature extraction; Switches; Software; Internet of Things; Protocols; Urban traffic control; software defined internet of things; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; modified proximal policy optimization	SIGNAL CONTROL; SYSTEM	As the growth of vehicles and the acceleration of urbanization, the urban traffic congestion problem becomes a burning issue in our society. Constructing a software defined Internet of things(SD-IoT) with a proper traffic control scheme is a promising solution for this issue. However, existing traffic control schemes do not make the best of the advances of the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning area. Furthermore, existing traffic congestion solutions based on deep reinforcement learning(DRL) only focus on controlling the signal of traffic lights, while ignore controlling vehicles to cooperate traffic lights. So the effect of urban traffic control is not comprehensive enough. In this article, we propose Modified Proximal Policy Optimization (Modified PPO) algorithm. This algorithm is ideally suited as the traffic control scheme of SD-IoT. We adaptively adjust the clip hyperparameter to limit the bound of the distance between the next policy and the current policy. What's more, based on the collected data of SD-IoT, the proposed algorithm controls traffic lights and vehicles in a global view to advance the performance of urban traffic control. Experimental results under different vehicle numbers show that the proposed method is more competitive and stable than the original algorithm. Our proposed method improves the performance of SD-IoT to relieve traffic congestion.

To this end, we propose a scoring rule to rank the missing features by taking into account both the economical criterion and the effective imputation information. The economical criterion takes both the imputation cost and the discriminative ability of the feature into account, while the effective imputation information enables to use all observed information in the data set including the imputed missing values to impute the left missing values. During the imputation process, our DIM first detects the neednot-impute samples for reducing the imputation cost and noise, and then selects the missing features with the top rank to impute first. The imputation process orderly imputes the missing features until all missing values are imputed or the imputation cost is exhausted. Experimental results on UCI data sets demonstrated the advantages of our proposed DIM, compared to the comparison methods, in terms of prediction accuracy and classification accuracy.

Ocean remote-sensing data archives reach several tens of petabytes and massive satellite data are acquired worldwide daily. To precisely, efficiently and intelligently mine the useful information submerged in such ocean remote-sensing data sets is a big challenge. Deep learning-a powerful technology recently emerging in the machine-learning field-has demonstrated its more significant superiority over traditional physical- or statistical-based algorithms for image-information extraction in many industrial-field applications and starts to draw interest in ocean remote-sensing applications. In this review paper, we first systematically reviewed two deep-learning frameworks that carry out ocean remote-sensing-image classifications and then presented eight typical applications in ocean internal-wave/eddy/oil-spill/coastal-inundation/sea-ice/green-algae/ship/coral-reef mapping from different types of ocean remote-sensing imagery to show how effective these deep-learning frameworks are. Researchers can also readily modify these existing frameworks for information mining of other kinds of remote-sensing imagery.

Identifying Customer Needs from User-Generated Content	MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						customer needs; online reviews; machine learning; voice of the customer; user-generated content; market research; text mining; deep learning; natural language processing	PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT; CONSUMER; DESIGN; MODEL	Firms traditionally rely on interviews and focus groups to identify customer needs for marketing strategy and product development. User-generated content (UGC) is a promising alternative source for identifying customer needs. However, established methods are neither efficient nor effective for large UGC corpora because much content is noninformative or repetitive. We propose a machine-learning approach to facilitate qualitative analysis by selecting content for efficient review. We use a convolutional neural network to filter out noninformative content and cluster dense sentence embeddings to avoid sampling repetitive content. We further address two key questions: Are UGC-based customer needs comparable to interview-based customer needs? Do the machine-learning methods improve customer-need identification? These comparisons are enabled by a custom data set of customer needs for oral care products identified by professional analysts using industry-standard experiential interviews. The analysts also coded 12,000 UGC sentences to identify which previously identified customer needs and/or new customer needs were articulated in each sentence. We show that (1) UGC is at least as valuable as a source of customer needs for product development, likely more valuable, compared with conventional methods, and (2) machine-learning methods improve efficiency of identifying customer needs from UGC (unique customer needs per unit of professional services cost).

Growing load requirement, global warming, and energy crisis need energy-intensive management to give sincere attempts to promote high accuracy energy monitoring techniques in order to enhance energy system efficiency and performance. The energy consumption data of domestic, commercial and industrial are becoming accessible to estimate the notable share of various sectors in the energy market. Energy forecasting algorithms play a vital role in energy sector development and policy formulation. Energy prediction and power supply management are the key roots of energy planning. A large number of prediction models have been used in the recent past. The selection of a prediction model usually based on available data, the objectives of the model network mechanism and energy planning operation. In this review, we conduct a critical and systematic review of renewable energy and electricity prediction models applied as an energy planning tool. The forecasting intervals is divided into three sections including: i) short-term; ii) medium-term; iii) and long-term. Three renewable energy resources, i.e. wind, solar, and geothermal energy, and electricity load demand requirement are considered for review forecasting analysis. Three major states-of-art forecasting classifications: i) machine learning algorithms; ii) ensemble-based approaches; iii) and artificial neural networks are analyzed. These approaches are investigated for prediction applicability; accuracy for spatial and temporal forecasting; and relevance to policy and planning objectives. The machine learning models can handle large amount of data with accurate forecasting analysis. Applying ensemble techniques enables us to obtain higher forecasting accuracy by combining different models. Artificial neural networks if used in the right way can contribute a robust choice, given that it is capible to extract and model unseen relationships and features. Furthermore, unlike these conventional techniques, artificial neural networks do not force any limitation on residual and input distributions. Findings from this review would help professionals and researchers in obtaining recognition of the prediction approaches and allow them to choose the relevant methods to satisfy their desired tasks and forecasting requirements.

Ironically, the treatment process is long and very costly due to its high recurrence and mortality rates. Accurate early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of cancer are essential to enhance the patient's survival rate. Developments in statistics and computer engineering over the years have encouraged many scientists to apply computational methods such as multivariate statistical analysis to analyze the prognosis of the disease, and the accuracy of such analyses is significantly higher than that of empirical predictions. Furthermore, as artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning and deep learning, has found popular applications in clinical cancer research in recent years, cancer prediction performance has reached new heights. This article reviews the literature on the application of AI to cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and summarizes its advantages. We explore how AI assists cancer diagnosis and prognosis, specifically with regard to its unprecedented accuracy, which is even higher than that of general statistical applications in oncology. We also demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, opportunities and challenges in the clinical implementation of AI are discussed. Hence, this article provides a new perspective on how AI technology can help improve cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and continue improving human health in the future.

Impact of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Therapy on Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Health Status Deep Learning CT Analysis and Patient-reported Outcomes	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY			English	Article						cystic fibrosis; chronic rhinosinusitis; machine learning; CFTR modulator; computed tomography	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ADULT CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS; SINUS SURGERY; LUNG-FUNCTION; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; MEDICAL THERAPY; IVACAFTOR; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; POPULATION	Rationale: Elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) in triple combination improves pulmonary health for people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). However, its impact on objective measures of sinus disease and health utility is unestablished. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of ETI on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and general health status incorporating computed tomography (CT), quality-of-life (QOL) and productivity loss. Methods: Adult PwCF+CRS with CF transmembrane conductance regulator genotype F508del/F508del or F508del/minimal function who clinically initiated ETI participated in a prospective, observational study. The primary endpoint was change in percent sinus CT opacification (%SO) after 6 months of ETI assessed via deep learning-based methods. Secondary endpoints included changes in sinonasal QOL, health utility value and productivity loss, which were evaluated monthly via validated metrics. Results: 30 PwCF provided baseline data; 25 completed the study. At baseline, the cohort had substantial CRS, with mean 22-question SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score 33.1 and mean sinus CT %SO 63.7%. At 6-month follow-up, %SO improved by mean 22.9% (P < 0.001). %SO improvement trended toward greater magnitude for those naive to prior modulator therapy (P = 0.09). Mean SNOT-22 scores and health utility improved by 15.3 and 0.068 [6.8%] (all P <= 0.007). Presenteeism, activity impairment and overall productivity loss improved (all P <= 0.049). Improvements in SNOT-22 scores and health utility occurred by one month and remained improved over the study.

J	Sun, JD; Yan, CH; Wen, JT				Sun, Jiedi; Yan, Changhong; Wen, Jiangtao			Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method Combining Compressed Data Acquisition and Deep Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Bearing fault; compressed sensing (CS); deep neural network (DNN); intelligent diagnosis; stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE)	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ROTATING MACHINERY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; TRANSFORM	Effective intelligent fault diagnosis has long been a research focus on the condition monitoring of rotary machinery systems. Traditionally, time-domain vibration-based fault diagnosis has some deficiencies, such as complex computation of feature vectors, excessive dependence on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, and limited capacity for learning complex relationships in fault signals. Furthermore, following the increase in condition data, how to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis has become an urgent need to solve. Inspired by the idea of compressed sensing and deep learning, a novel intelligent diagnosis method is proposed for fault identification of rotating machines. In this paper, a nonlinear projection is applied to achieve the compressed acquisition, which not only reduces the amount of measured data that contained all the information of faults but also realizes the automatic feature extraction in transform domain. For exploring the discrimination hidden in the acquired data, a stacked sparse autoencoders-based deep neural network is established and performed with an unsupervised learning procedure followed by a supervised fine-tuning process. We studied the significance of compressed acquisition and provided the effects of key factors and comparison with traditional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using data sets from rolling element bearings and the analysis shows that it is able to obtain high diagnotic accuracies and is superior to the existing methods. The proposed method reduces the need of human labor and expertise and provides new strategy to handle the massive data more easily.

To compare performance of the SGOA and other algorithms, an investigation to select CEC2017 benchmark function as the test set was carried out. Also, the Friedman assessment was performed to check the significance of the proposed method against other counterparts. In comparison with ten meta-heuristic algorithms such as differential evolution (DE), the proposed SGOA can rank first in the CEC2017, and also ranks first in comparison with ten advanced algorithms. The simulation results reveal that the SA strategy notably improves the exploration and exploitation capacity of GOA. Moreover, the SGOA is also applied to engineering problems and parameter optimization of the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). After optimizing the parameters of KELM using SGOA, the model was applied to two datasets, Cleveland Heart Dataset and Japanese Bankruptcy Dataset, and they achieved an accuracy of 79.2% and 83.5%, respectively, which were better than the KELM model obtained other algorithms. In these practical applications, it is indicated that the proposed SGOA can provide effective assistance in settling complex optimization problems with impressive results.

Meanwhile, an optimal load dispatch model for grid-connected community microgrid which includes residential power load, PV arrays, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage system (ESS), is established under three different scheduling scenarios. To promote the supply-demand balance, the uncertainties of both residential power load and PV power output are considered in the model by integrating the forecasting results. Two real-world data sets are used to test the proposed forecasting model, and the results show that the DRNN-LSTM model performs better than multi-layer perception (MLP) network and support vector machine (SVM). Finally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the load dispatch of grid-connected community microgrid. The results show that EES and the coordinated charging mode of EVs can promote peak load shifting and reduce 8.97% of the daily costs. This study contributes to the optimal load dispatch of community microgrid with load and renewable energy forecasting. The optimal load dispatch of community microgrid with deep learning based solar power and load forecasting achieves total costs reduction and system reliability improvement. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While some machines offer powder bed visualization during builds, they lack automated analysis capability. This work presents an approach for in-situ monitoring and analysis of powder bed images with the potential to become a component of a real-time control system in an LPBF machine. Specifically, a computer vision algorithm is used to automatically detect and classify anomalies that occur during the powder spreading stage of the process. Anomaly detection and classification are implemented using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, operating on a moderately-sized training database of image patches. The performance of the final algorithm is evaluated, and its usefulness as a standalone software package is demonstrated with several case studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lai Chau, a province in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam was chosen as a case study since it had recently undergone severe flashflood in 2018. For this purpose, numerical predictor variables such as topographically derived factors (Digital Elevation Model, Aspect, Slope, Curvature, Topographic Wetness Index), climatic variables (Rain), and hydrological variables (stream density, stream power index, distance to river) and multiple remote sensing indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Buildup Index) were used. These predictor variables were selected because they are globally collectible and reproducible. The performances of these models were evaluated by using common statistical indicators, namely Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Overall Accuracy and Area under Receiving Operating Characteristics, and the statistical test of differences. The results showed that the proposed swarm intelligence models outperformed benchmarked methods, namely Particle Swarm Optimization, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest in almost all comparing indicators. It is suggested that proposed models are more robust than the classifiers, which were used for benchmarking and they are good alternatives for flood susceptibility mapping given the availability of dataset.

Digital images providing millions of morphological datasets can fast and non-invasively be analyzed in a comprehensive manner using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods based on machine learning (ML) and particularly deep learning (DL) are able to identify, localize and quantify pathological features in almost every macular and retinal disease. Convolutional neural networks thereby mimic the path of the human brain for object recognition through learning of pathological features from training sets, supervised ML, or even extrapolation from patterns recognized independently, unsupervised ML. The methods of AI-based retinal analyses are diverse and differ widely in their applicability, interpretability and reliability in different datasets and diseases. Fully automated AI-based systems have recently been approved for screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The overall potential of ML/DL includes screening, diagnostic grading as well as guidance of therapy with automated detection of disease activity, recurrences, quantification of therapeutic effects and identification of relevant targets for novel therapeutic approaches. Prediction and prognostic conclusions further expand the potential benefit of AI in retina which will enable personalized health care as well as large scale management and will empower the ophthalmologist to provide high quality diagnosis/therapy and successfully deal with the complexity of 21st century ophthalmology.

J	Hartmann, J; Huppertz, J; Schamp, C; Heitmann, M				Hartmann, Jochen; Huppertz, Juliana; Schamp, Christina; Heitmann, Mark			Comparing automated text classification methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING			English	Article						Text classification; Social media; Machine learning; User-generated content; Sentiment analysis; Natural language processing	SENTIMENT; EMOTIONS; OPINION; MODEL	Online social media drive the growth of unstructured text data. Many marketing applications require structuring this data at scales non-accessible to human coding, e.g., to detect communication shifts in sentiment or other researcher-defined content categories. Several methods have been proposed to automatically classify unstructured text. This paper compares the performance of ten such approaches (five lexicon-based, five machine learning algorithms) across 41 social media datasets covering major social media platforms, various sample sizes, and languages. So far, marketing research relies predominantly on support vector machines (SVM) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Across all tasks we study, either random forest (RF) or naive Bayes (NB) performs best in terms of correctly uncovering human intuition. In particular, RF exhibits consistently high performance for three-class sentiment, NB for small samples sizes. SVM never outperform the remaining methods. All lexicon-based approaches, LIWC in particular, perform poorly compared with machine learning. In some applications, accuracies only slightly exceed chance. Since additional considerations of text classification choice are also in favor of NB and RF, our results suggest that marketing research can benefit from considering these alternatives.

This goal can be quickly achieved by designing new materials and predicting their performance without experimentation to reduce the number of potential targets. We introduce a multidimensional design and discovery pipeline to systematize materials discovery and reduce the dependence on a serendipitous approach. Machine learning models are trained on data collected from the literature for the prediction of various properties, such energy levels (HOMO and LUMO), UV/visible absorption maxima (both in solution and film) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). More than 5000 new small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are designed using easily synthesizable building blocks. 1700 small molecule acceptors without a suitable energy level match with PBT7-Th are filtered off. SMAs with blue-shifted absorption maxima are not further considered. The number of SMAs was reduced to 2350 on the basis of the predicted UV/visible absorption maxima. Then, the SMAs were further screened on the basis of the predicted power conversion efficiency (PCE). More than 100 SMAs with PCE >13% were selected and further studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The mixing behavior of the PBT7-Th:SMA blends was studied using the Flory-Huggins parameter. 15 SMAs that exhibited balanced mixing with PBT7-Th were selected. Finally, the best predicted PCE is over 15% with the common IDTT core, which is far better than that of reported results. This is an effective pipeline to design and screen potential materials without revisiting the previous experimental work, and thus will pave the way to cost- and time-efficient discovery of novel materials.

It often causes pneumonia in humans. Artificial intelligence models have been helpful for successful analyses in the biomedical field. In this study, Coronavirus was detected using a deep learning model, which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. Our dataset consists of three classes namely: coronavirus, pneumonia, and normal X-ray imagery. In this study, the data classes were restructured using the Fuzzy Color technique as a preprocessing step and the images that were structured with the original images were stacked. In the next step, the stacked dataset was trained with deep learning models (MobileNetV2, SqueezeNet) and the feature sets obtained by the models were processed using the Social Mimic optimization method. Thereafter, efficient features were combined and classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overall classification rate obtained with the proposed approach was 99.27%. With the proposed approach in this study, it is evident that the model can efficiently contribute to the detection of COVID-19 disease.

The perception system of an AV, which normally employs machine learning (e.g., deep learning), transforms sensory data into semantic information that enables autonomous driving. Object detection is a fundamental function of this perception system, which has been tackled by several works, most of them using 2D detection methods. However, the 2D methods do not provide depth information, which is required for driving tasks, such as path planning, collision avoidance, and so on. Alternatively, the 3D object detection methods introduce a third dimension that reveals more detailed object's size and location information. Nonetheless, the detection accuracy of such methods needs to be improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on 3D object detection methods used for autonomous driving applications. This paper presents an overview of 3D object detection methods and prevalently used sensors and datasets in AVs. It then discusses and categorizes the recent works based on sensors modalities into monocular, point cloudbased, and fusion methods. We then summarize the results of the surveyed works and identify the research gaps and future research directions.

In this study, the prediction accuracy of new heuristic methods, optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5Tree), is examined in modeling monthly streamflows using precipitation and temperature inputs. Data collected from Kalam and Chakdara stations at a mountainous basin, Swat River Basin, Pakistan are utilized as case study. The prediction accuracy of all four methods are validated and tested using four different input scenarios and evaluated using combined accuracy (CA), a newly used criterion in addition to root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The test results of both stations show that the LSSVM and MARS-based models provide more accurate prediction results compared to OP-ELM and M5Tree models. LSSVM decreases the RMSE of the MARS, OP-ELM and M5Tree by 9.12%, 25.64% and 35.15% for the Kalam station while the RMSEs of the LSSVM, OP-ELM and M5Tree is decreased by 2.12%, 34.81% and 32.52% using MARS, for the Chakdara Station, respectively. It is observed that the monthly streamflows of Kalam Station can be successfully predicted using only temperature data. Only precipitation inputs also provide good accuracy for Kalam Station while they produce inaccurate predictions for the Chakdara Station. The prediction capabilities of the applied methods are also examined in estimating streamflow of downstream station using upstream data. The results prove the dominancy of LSSVM and MARS-based models over OP-ELM and M5Tree in prediction streamflow data without local input data. Heuristic methods are also compared with stochastic method of seasonal auto regressive moving average (SARIMA). The OP-ELM, LSSVM, MARS perform superior to the SARIMA in monthly streamflow prediction. Based on the overall results, the LSSVM and MARS are recommended for monthly streamflow prediction with or without local data.

Because of the limited local storage at user side, data and classifier has to be outsourced to cloud for storing and computing.

In this work, we propose a framework for privacy-preserving outsourced classification in cloud computing (POCC).

However, building a high-quality DL system for a specific task highly relies on human expertise, hindering its wide application. Meanwhile, automated machine learning (AutoML) is a promising solution for building a DL system without human assistance and is being extensively studied. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in AutoML. According to the DL pipeline, we introduce AutoML methods - covering data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS) - with a particular focus on NAS, as it is currently a hot sub-topic of AutoML. We summarize the representative NAS algorithms' performance on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and further discuss the following subjects of NAS methods: one/two-stage NAS, one-shot NAS, joint hyperparameter and architecture optimization, and resource-aware NAS. Finally, we discuss some open problems related to the existing AutoML methods for future research. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, N-area) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors.

In this study, we propose a learning-to-match (LTM) method to break IoU restriction, allowing objects to match anchors in a flexible manner. LTM updates hand-crafted anchor assignment to "free" anchor matching by formulating detector training in the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) framework. During the training phase, LTM is implemented by converting the detection likelihood to anchor matching loss functions which are plug-and-play. Minimizing the matching loss functions drives learning and selecting features which best explain a class of objects with respect to both classification and localization. LTM is extended from anchor-based detectors to anchor-free detectors, validating the general applicability of learnable object-feature matching mechanism for visual object detection. Experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that LTM detectors consistently outperform counterpart detectors with significant margins.

Nevertheless, the entry barriers for EO researchers are high due to the dense and rapidly developing field mainly driven by advances in computer vision (CV). To lower the barriers for researchers in EO, this review gives an overview of the evolution of DL with a focus on image segmentation and object detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The survey starts in 2012, when a CNN set new standards in image recognition, and lasts until late 2019. Thereby, we highlight the connections between the most important CNN architectures and cornerstones coming from CV in order to alleviate the evaluation of modern DL models. Furthermore, we briefly outline the evolution of the most popular DL frameworks and provide a summary of datasets in EO. By discussing well performing DL architectures on these datasets as well as reflecting on advances made in CV and their impact on future research in EO, we narrow the gap between the reviewed, theoretical concepts from CV and practical application in EO.

A precise prediction of PWP is difficult due to complex physical mechanisms and in situ natural variability. To explore the applicability and advantages of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on PWP prediction, three variants of RNNs, i.e., standard RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are adopted and compared with a traditional static artificial neural network (ANN), i.e., multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Measurements of rainfall and PWP of representative piezometers from a fully instrumented natural slope in Hong Kong are used to establish the prediction models. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are used for model evaluations. The influence of input time series length on the model performance is investigated. The results reveal that MLP can provide acceptable performance but is not robust. The uncertainty bounds of RMSE of the MLP model range from 0.24 kPa to 1.12 kPa for the selected two piezometers. The standard RNN can perform better but the robustness is slightly affected when there are significant time lags between PWP changes and rainfall. The GRU and LSTM models can provide more precise and robust predictions than the standard RNN. The effects of the hidden layer structure and the dropout technique are investigated. The single-layer GRU is accurate enough for PWP prediction, whereas a double-layer GRU brings extra time cost with little accuracy improvement. The dropout technique is essential to overfitting prevention and improvement of accuracy.

J	Hao, Y; Tian, CS				Hao, Yan; Tian, Chengshi			A novel two-stage forecasting model based on error factor and ensemble method for multi-step wind power forecasting	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Wind power forecasting; Two-stage forecasting model; Multi-objective optimization algorithm; Extreme learning machine	MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; SPEED; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; DECOMPOSITION	With the fast growth of wind power penetration into the electric grid, wind power forecasting plays an increasingly significant role in the secure and economic operation of power systems. Although there have been numerous studies concerning wind power forecasting, most of them have failed to make the best of the information implied in the error value, focused only on simple error correction, adopted a simple ensemble method to aggregate the predictions of each component, and considered improving only forecasting accuracy. Recognizing these issues, a novel two-stage forecasting model based on the error factor, a nonlinear ensemble method and the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer algorithm is proposed for wind power forecasting. More specially, in stage I, the extreme learning machine optimized by the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer is used to forecast the components decomposed by variational mode decomposition, and an error prediction model based on the extreme learning machine optimized by the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer is utilized to predict forecast errors; also, a novel nonlinear ensemble method based on the extreme learning machine optimized by the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer is utilized to integrate all the components and forecast error values in stage II. Three real-world wind power datasets collected from Canada and Spain are introduced to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the developed model. The forecasting results reveal that the proposed model is superior to all the other considered models in terms of both accuracy and stability and thus can be a useful tool for wind power forecasting.

The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial-temporal GNNs. We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of GNNs. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.

In this paper, we intend to minimize the energy cost of an HVAC system in a multi-zone commercial building with the consideration of random zone occupancy, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality comfort. Due to the existence of unknown thermal dynamics models, parameter uncertainties (e.g., outdoor temperature, electricity price, and number of occupants), spatially and temporally coupled constraints associated with indoor temperature and CO2 concentration, a large discrete solution space, and a non-convex and non-separable objective function, it is very challenging to achieve the above aim. To this end, the above energy cost minimization problem is reformulated as a Markov game. Then, an HVAC control algorithm is proposed to solve the Markov game based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with attention mechanism. The proposed algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of uncertain parameters and can operate without knowing building thermal dynamics models. Simulation results based on real-world traces show the effectiveness, robustness and scalability of the proposed algorithm.

Low-N protein engineering with data-efficient deep learning	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							DIRECTED EVOLUTION; FITNESS LANDSCAPE; DESIGN; RECONSTRUCTION; MUTATIONS; EPISTASIS; CONSENSUS; POTENT; SPACE; GENE	Protein engineering has enormous academic and industrial potential. However, it is limited by the lack of experimental assays that are consistent with the design goal and sufficiently high throughput to find rare, enhanced variants. Here we introduce a machine learning-guided paradigm that can use as few as 24 functionally assayed mutant sequences to build an accurate virtual fitness landscape and screen ten million sequences via in silico directed evolution. As demonstrated in two dissimilar proteins, GFP from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) and E. coli strain TEM-1 beta-lactamase, top candidates from a single round are diverse and as active as engineered mutants obtained from previous high-throughput efforts. By distilling information from natural protein sequence landscapes, our model learns a latent representation of 'unnaturalness', which helps to guide search away from nonfunctional sequence neighborhoods. Subsequent low-N supervision then identifies improvements to the activity of interest. In sum, our approach enables efficient use of resource-intensive high-fidelity assays without sacrificing throughput, and helps to accelerate engineered proteins into the fermenter, field and clinic.

J	Jin, YR; Qin, CJ; Huang, YX; Liu, CL				Jin, Yanrui; Qin, Chengjin; Huang, Yixiang; Liu, Chengliang			Actual bearing compound fault diagnosis based on active learning and decoupling attentional residual network	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Active learning; Attention modules; Bearing compound fault; Multi-label decoupling classifier; Residual block	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; ROTATING MACHINERY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; IDENTIFICATION; AUTOENCODER	Existing deep learning methods commonly requires massive labeled data for compound fault diagnosis, which is difficult and time-consuming to collect in the real application. This paper presents a novel decoupling attentional residual network for compound fault diagnosis. Original signal is processed by the short-time Fourier transform and its output is fed into the subsequent network. Then, attention modules are introduced into the model to selectively emphasize certain features. Additionally, a multi-label decoupling classifier is designed to accurately decouple and identify the compound faults. Besides, active learning approach is introduced to achieve the same results using few compound faults samples. The proposed method was validated on our bearing dataset, which shows that it can reach 100% overall accuracy.

J	Beck, C; Weinan, E; Jentzen, A				Beck, Christian; Weinan, E.; Jentzen, Arnulf			Machine Learning Approximation Algorithms for High-Dimensional Fully Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Second-order Backward Stochastic Differential Equations	JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Deep learning; Second-order backward stochastic differential equation; 2BSDE; Numerical method; Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation; Knightian uncertainty; Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation; HJB equation; Nonlinear expectation; G-Brownian motion	DISCRETE-TIME APPROXIMATION; ORDER NUMERICAL SCHEMES; DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; BROWNIAN-MOTION; SIMULATION; BSDES; DISCRETIZATION	High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in a number of models from the financial industry, such as in derivative pricing models, credit valuation adjustment models, or portfolio optimization models. The PDEs in such applications are high-dimensional as the dimension corresponds to the number of financial assets in a portfolio. Moreover, such PDEs are often fully nonlinear due to the need to incorporate certain nonlinear phenomena in the model such as default risks, transaction costs, volatility uncertainty (Knightian uncertainty), or trading constraints in the model. Such high-dimensional fully nonlinear PDEs are exceedingly difficult to solve as the computational effort for standard approximation methods grows exponentially with the dimension. In this work, we propose a new method for solving high-dimensional fully nonlinear second-order PDEs. Our method can in particular be used to sample from high-dimensional nonlinear expectations. The method is based on (1) a connection between fully nonlinear second-order PDEs and second-order backward stochastic differential equations (2BSDEs), (2) a merged formulation of the PDE and the 2BSDE problem, (3) a temporal forward discretization of the 2BSDE and a spatial approximation via deep neural nets, and (4) a stochastic gradient descent-type optimization procedure. Numerical results obtained using TensorFlow in Python illustrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the method in the cases of a 100-dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, a 100-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and a nonlinear expectation of a 100-dimensional G-Brownian motion.

In particular, the applications of deep CNNs using optical remote sensing data have focused on the classification of very high-resolution aerial and satellite data, owing to the similarity of these data to the large datasets in computer vision. Accordingly, this study presents a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep learning tools for classification of complex wetland classes using multispectral RapidEye optical imagery. Specifically, we examine the capacity of seven well-known deep convnets, namely DenseNet121, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2, for wetland mapping in Canada. In addition, the classification results obtained from deep CNNs are compared with those based on conventional machine learning tools, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to further evaluate the efficiency of the former to classify wetlands. The results illustrate that the full-training of convnets using five spectral bands outperforms the other strategies for all convnets. InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception are distinguished as the top three convnets, providing state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 96.17%, 94.81%, and 93.57%, respectively. The classification accuracies obtained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are 74.89% and 76.08%, respectively, considerably inferior relative to CNNs. Importantly, InceptionResNetV2 is consistently found to be superior compared to all other convnets, suggesting the integration of Inception and ResNet modules is an efficient architecture for classifying complex remote sensing scenes such as wetlands.

Objective: In recent years, the rise of computational biology methods based on Machine Learning (ML) has greatly improved the detection efficiency of DBPs. Methods: In this study, the Multiple Kernel-based Fuzzy SVM Model with Support Vector Data Description (MK-FSVM-SVDD) is proposed to predict DBPs. Firstly, sex features are extracted from the protein sequence. Secondly, multiple kernels are constructed via these sequence features. Then, multiple kernels are integrated by Centered Kernel Alignment-based Multiple Kernel Learning (CKA-MKL). Next, fuzzy membership scores of training samples are calculated with Support Vector Data Description (SVDD). FSVM is trained and employed to detect new DBPs. Results: Our model is evaluated on several benchmark datasets. Compared with other methods, MKFSVM- SVDD achieves best Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) on PDB186 (0.7250) and PDB2272 (0.5476). Conclusion: We can conclude that MK-FSVM-SVDD is more suitable than common SVM, as the classifier for DNA-binding proteins identification.

Hence, network security analytics has become an important area of concern and has gained intensive attention among researchers, off late, specifically in the domain of anomaly detection in network, which is considered crucial for network security. However, preliminary investigations have revealed that the existing approaches to detect anomalies in network are not effective enough, particularly to detect them in real time. The reason for the inefficacy of current approaches is mainly due the amassment of massive volumes of data though the connected devices. Therefore, it is crucial to propose a framework that effectively handles real time big data processing and detect anomalies in networks. In this regard, this paper attempts to address the issue of detecting anomalies in real time. Respectively, this paper has surveyed the state-of-the-art real-time big data processing technologies related to anomaly detection and the vital characteristics of associated machine learning algorithms. This paper begins with the explanation of essential contexts and taxonomy of real-time big data processing, anomalous detection, and machine learning algorithms, followed by the review of big data processing technologies. Finally, the identified research challenges of real-time big data processing in anomaly detection are discussed.

Several problems such as budget increase and construction period extension can be caused by squeezing in rock mass. It is significant to propose a model for accurate prediction of rock squeezing. In this research, the support vector machine (SVM) as a machine learning model was optimized by the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), WOA-SVM, to classify the tunnel squeezing based on 114 real cases. The role of WOA in this system is to optimize the hyper-parameters of SVM model for receiving a higher level of accuracy. In the established database, five input parameters, i.e., buried depth, support stiffness, rock tunneling quality index, diameter and the percentage strain, were used. In the process of model classification, different effective parameters of SVM and WOA were considered, and the optimum parameters were designed. To examine the accuracy of the WOA-SVM, the base SVM, ANN (refers to the multilayer perceptron) and GP (refers to the Gaussian process classification) were also constructed. Evaluation of these models showed that the optimized WOA-SVM is the best model among all proposed models in classifying the tunnel squeezing. It has the highest accuracy (approximately 0.9565) than other un-optimized individual classifiers (SVM, ANN, and GP). This was obtained based on results of different performance indexes. In addition, according to sensitivity analysis, the percentage strain is highly sensitive to the model, followed by buried depth and support stiffness. That means, e, H and K are the best combination of parameters for the WOA-SVM model.

Deep learning of aftershock patterns following large earthquakes	NATURE			English	Article							STRONG-MOTION DATA; WAVE-FORM INVERSION; SOURCE RUPTURE PROCESS; STRONG GROUND MOTION; 1992 LANDERS EARTHQUAKE; TOKACHI-OKI EARTHQUAKE; LOMA-PRIETA EARTHQUAKE; TELESEISMIC BODY-WAVE; 1979 IMPERIAL-VALLEY; HYOGO-KEN NANBU	Aftershocks are a response to changes in stress generated by large earthquakes and represent the most common observations of the triggering of earthquakes. The maximum magnitude of aftershocks and their temporal decay are well described by empirical laws (such as Bath's law(1) and Omori's law(2)), but explaining and forecasting the spatial distribution of aftershocks is more difficult. Coulomb failure stress change(3) is perhaps the most widely used criterion to explain the spatial distributions of aftershocks(4-8), but its applicability has been disputed(9-11). Here we use a deep-learning approach to identify a static-stress-based criterion that forecasts aftershock locations without prior assumptions about fault orientation. We show that a neural network trained on more than 131,000 mainshock-aftershock pairs can predict the locations of aftershocks in an independent test dataset of more than 30,000 mainshock-aftershock pairs more accurately (area under curve of 0.849) than can classic Coulomb failure stress change (area under curve of 0.583). We find that the learned aftershock pattern is physically interpretable: the maximum change in shear stress, the von Mises yield criterion (a scaled version of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress-change tensor) and the sum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor each explain more than 98 per cent of the variance in the neural-network prediction. This machine-learning-driven insight provides improved forecasts of aftershock locations and identifies physical quantities that may control earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.

Accurate and rapid phenotypic trait data acquisition and analysis can improve genomic selection and accelerate cultivar development. In this work, a technique for data acquisition and image processing was developed utilizing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral imaging, and deep learning convolutional neural networks to evaluate phenotypic characteristics on citrus crops. This low-cost and automated high-throughput phenotyping technique utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to: (i) detect, count, and geolocate trees and tree gaps; (ii) categorize trees based on their canopy size; (iii) develop individual tree health indices; and (iv) evaluate citrus varieties and rootstocks. The proposed remote sensing technique was able to detect and count citrus trees in a grove of 4,931 trees, with precision and recall of 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively, estimate their canopy size with overall accuracy of 85.5%, and detect, count, and geolocate tree gaps with a precision and recall of 100% and 94.6%, respectively.

Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests (tsfresh - A Python package)	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Feature engineering; Time series; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Machine learning		Time series feature engineering is a time-consuming process because scientists and engineers have to consider the multifarious algorithms of signal processing and time series analysis for identifying and extracting meaningful features from time series. The Python package tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests) accelerates this process by combining 63 time series characterization methods, which by default compute a total of 794 time series features, with feature selection on basis automatically configured hypothesis tests. By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications.

Such approaches should be robust against substantial variations in scenes due to poor luminosity, orientation of fish, seabed structures, movement of aquatic plants in the background and image diversity in the shape and texture among fish of different species. Keeping this challenge in mind, we propose a unified approach to detect freely moving fish in unconstrained underwater environments using a Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network, a state-of-the-art machine learning technique used to solve generic object detection and localization problems. To train the neural network, we employ a novel approach to utilize motion information of fish in videos via background subtraction and optical flow, and subsequently combine the outcomes with the raw image to generate fish-dependent candidate regions. We use two benchmark datasets extracted from a large Fish4Knowledge underwater video repository, Complex Scenes dataset and the LifeCLEF 2015 fish dataset to validate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach. We achieve a detection accuracy (F-Score) of 87.44% and 80.02% respectively on these datasets, which advocate the utilization of our approach for fish detection task.

In order to overcome these limitations, an unsupervised domain-share convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for efficient fault transfer diagnosis of machines from steady speeds to time-varying speeds. First, a Cauchy kernel-induced maximum mean discrepancy based on unbiased estimation is developed for improving the efficiency and robustness of feature adaptation. Secondly, an unsupervised domain-share CNN is constructed to simultaneously extract the domain invariant features from the source domain and the target domain. Finally, adjustable and segmented balance factors are designed to flexibly weigh the distribution-adaptation loss and cross-entropy loss to improve diagnosis accuracy and transferability. The proposed method analyzes raw vibration signals collected from bearings and gears under different rotating speeds. Results of case studies show that the proposed method can achieve higher diagnosis accuracy, faster convergence, and better robustness than the reported methods, which demonstrates its potential applications in machine fault transfer diagnosis from a steady speed condition to a time-varying speed condition.

Despite these gains, the future development and practical deployment of deep networks are hindered by their black-box nature, i.e., a lack of interpretability and the need for very large training sets. An emerging technique called algorithm unrolling, or unfolding, offers promise in eliminating these issues by providing a concrete and systematic connection between iterative algorithms that are widely used in signal processing and deep neural networks. Unrolling methods were first proposed to develop fast neural network approximations for sparse coding. More recently, this direction has attracted enormous attention, and it is rapidly growing in both theoretic investigations and practical applications. The increasing popularity of unrolled deep networks is due, in part, to their potential in developing efficient, high-performance (yet interpretable) network architectures from reasonably sized training sets.

To identify and choose effective and personalized strategies to prevent or slow the progression of AD, we need to develop objective measures that are able to discriminate the MCI patients who are at risk of AD from those MCI patients who have less risk to develop AD. Here, we present a novel deep learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc layer for 3D separable convolutions, which aims at identifying MCI patients who have a high likelihood of developing AD within 3 years. Our deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 genetic data as input measures. The most novel characteristics of our machine learning model compared to previous ones are the following: 1) our deep learning model is multi-tasking, in the sense that it jointly learns to simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion as well as AD vs. healthy controls classification, which facilitates relevant feature extraction for AD prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier employs fewer parameters than other deep learning architectures which significantly limits data-overfitting (we use similar to 550,000 network parameters, which is orders of magnitude lower than other network designs); 3) both structural MRI images and their warp field characteristics, which quantify local volumetric changes in relation to the MRI template, were used as separate input streams to extract as much information as possible from the MRI data. All analyses were performed on a subset of the database made publicly available via the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (n = 785 participants, n = 192 AD patients, n = 409 MCI patients (including both MCI patients who convert to AD and MCI patients who do not covert to AD), and n = 184 healthy controls). The most predictive combination of inputs were the structural MRI images and the demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data. In contrast, the warp field metrics were of little added predictive value. The algorithm was able to distinguish the MCI patients developing AD within 3 years from those patients with stable MCI over the same time-period with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.925 and a 10-fold cross-validated accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 85%. To our knowledge, this is the highest performance achieved so far using similar datasets. The same network provided an AUC of 1 and 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when classifying patients with AD from healthy controls. Our classification framework was also robust to the use of different co-registration templates and potentially irrelevant features/image portions. Our approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging modalities, such as PET, and diverse other sets of clinical data. The convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image dataset and gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis system targeting the prediction of several medical conditions and neuropsychiatric disorders via multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical data.

Currently, there is a notable shift towards machine learning (ML) methodologies to aid such procedures. Deep learning has recently gained considerable attention as it allows the model to 'learn' to extract features that are relevant for the task at hand. Results: We have developed a novel deep neural network estimating the binding affinity of ligand-receptor complexes. The complex is represented with a 3D grid, and the model utilizes a 3D convolution to produce a feature map of this representation, treating the atoms of both proteins and ligands in the same manner.

Understanding the complex rules that govern escape could inform therapeutic design. We modeled viral escape with machine learning algorithms originally developed for human natural language. We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence's grammaticality but change its meaning. With this approach, language models of influenza hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HIV Env), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike viral proteins can accurately predict structural escape patterns using sequence data alone. Our study represents a promising conceptual bridge between natural language and viral evolution.

Dynamic and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmaI robot, a sophisticated medium-dog-sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior methods: ANYmaI is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations.

J	Liu, T; Yang, LX; Lunga, D				Liu, Tao; Yang, Lexie; Lunga, Dalton			Change detection using deep learning approach with object-based image analysis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Change detection; OBIA; Deep learning; Pixel-based; Feature fusion	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS; RANDOM FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; MISREGISTRATION; SEGMENTATION; MACHINE	In their applications, both deep learning techniques and object-based image analysis (OBIA) have shown better performance separately than conventional methods on change detection tasks. However, efforts to investigate the effect of combining these two techniques for advancing change detection techniques are unexplored in current literature. This study proposes a novel change detection method implementing change feature extraction using convolutional neural networks under an OBIA framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare the proposed method against benchmark pixel-based counterparts on aerial images for the task of multi-class change detection. To thoroughly assess the performance of our proposed method, this study also for the first time compared three common feature fusion schemes for change detection architecture: concatenation, differencing, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed method was also tested on simulated misregistered images to evaluate its robustness, a factor that plays an important role in compromising change detection accuracy but has not been investigated for supervised change detection methods in the literature. Finally, the proposed change detection method was also tested using very high resolution (VHR) satellite images for binary class change detection to map an impacted area caused by natural disaster and the result was evaluated using reference data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). With the experimental results from these two sets of experiments, we showed that (1) our proposed method achieved substantially higher accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to pixel-based methods, (2) three feature fusion schemes did not show a significant difference for overall accuracy, (3) our proposed method was robust in image misregistration in both testing and training data, (4) we demonstrate the potential impact of automation to decision making by deploying our method to map a large geographic area affected by a recent natural disaster.

To exploit 3D cues within stereo images, recent CNN based methods commonly use cost volume techniques to capture stereo correspondence over large disparities. However, since disparities can vary significantly for stereo cameras with different baselines, focal lengths and resolutions, the fixed maximum disparity used in cost volume techniques hinders them to handle different stereo image pairs with large disparity variations. In this paper, we propose a generic parallax-attention mechanism (PAM) to capture stereo correspondence regardless of disparity variations. Our PAM integrates epipolar constraints with attention mechanism to calculate feature similarities along the epipolar line to capture stereo correspondence. Based on our PAM, we propose a parallax-attention stereo matching network (PASMnet) and a parallax-attention stereo image super-resolution network (PASSRnet) for stereo matching and stereo image super-resolution tasks. Moreover, we introduce a new and large-scale dataset named Flickr1024 for stereo image super-resolution. Experimental results show that our PAM is generic and can effectively learn stereo correspondence under large disparity variations in an unsupervised manner. Comparative results show that our PASMnet and PASSRnet achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

The Copernicus programme developed by the European Space Agency provides, with missions such as Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2), radar and optical (multi-spectral) imagery, respectively, at 10 m spatial resolution with revisit time around 5 days. Such high temporal resolution allows to collect Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) that support a plethora of Earth surface monitoring tasks. How to effectively combine the complementary information provided by such sensors remains an open problem in the remote sensing field. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture to combine information coming from S1 and S2 time series, namely TWINNS (TWIn Neural Networks for Sentinel data), able to discover spatial and temporal dependencies in both types of SITS. The proposed architecture is devised to boost the land cover classification task by leveraging two levels of complementarity, i.e., the interplay between radar and optical SITS as well as the synergy between spatial and temporal dependencies. Experiments carried out on two study sites characterized by different land cover characteristics (i.e., the Koumbia site in Burkina Faso and Reunion Island, a overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean), demonstrate the significance of our proposal.

As a commonly used deep learning technique, stacked autoencoders (SAEs) have shown the ability of automatic feature extraction and classification. However, the traditional SAEs have two deficiencies: (1) The multi-layer structure and too many epoch number always require plenty of time for training. (2) The internal covariate shift problem exists in deep networks, leading to that it is hard to train the model with saturating nonlinearities. To overcome the aforementioned deficiencies, a recently developed optimization method called batch normalization is introduced into deep neural networks (DNNs). The method is employed in every layer of DNNs to obtain a steady distribution of activation values during training. Besides, it applies normalization technique on every mini-batch training. As a result, it offers an easy starting condition for training, and the training epoch number can also be reduced. Thus, fault features can be extracted rapidly in an elegant way. A bearing and a gearbox datasets are adopted to conform the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can not only solve the two deficiencies of SAEs, but also achieve a superior performance to the existing methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Physical reservoir computing is a recently introduced framework that allows one to exploit the complex dynamics of physical systems as information-processing devices. This framework is particularly suited for edge computing devices, in which information processing is incorporated at the edge (e.g. into sensors) in a decentralized manner to reduce the adaptation delay caused by data transmission overhead. This paper aims to illustrate the potentials of the framework using examples from soft robotics and to provide a concise overview focusing on the basic motivations for introducing it, which stem from a number of fields, including machine learning, nonlinear dynamical systems, biological science, materials science, and physics.

These methods generally follow the nonlocal filtering processing chain, aiming at circumventing the staircase effect and preserving the details of phase variations. In this article, we propose an alternative approach for InSAR phase restoration, that is, Complex Convolutional Sparse Coding (ComCSC) and its gradient regularized version. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that we solve the InSAR phase restoration problem in a deconvolutional fashion. The proposed methods can not only suppress interferometric phase noise, but also avoid the staircase effect and preserve the details. Furthermore, they provide an insight into the elementary phase components for the interferometric phases. The experimental results on synthetic and realistic high- and medium-resolution data sets from TerraSAR-X StripMap and Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath mode, respectively, show that our method outperforms those previous state-of-the-art methods based on nonlocal InSAR filters, particularly the state-of-the-art method: InSAR-BM3D.

The majority of studies suffer from limitations in planning, conduct and reporting, resulting in low robustness, reproducibility and applicability. We here present a consented checklist on planning, conducting and reporting of AI studies for authors, reviewers and readers in dental research. Methods: Lending from existing reviews, standards and other guidance documents, an initial draft of the checklist and an explanatory document were derived and discussed among the members of IADR's e-oral network and the ITU/WHO focus group "Artificial Intelligence for Health (AI4H)". The checklist was consented by 27 group members via an e-Delphi process. Results: Thirty-one items on planning, conducting and reporting of AI studies were agreed on. These involve items on the studies' wider goal, focus, design and specific aims, data sampling and reporting, sample estimation, reference test construction, model parameters, training and evaluation, uncertainty and explainability, performance metrics and data partitions. Conclusion: Authors, reviewers and readers should consider this checklist when planning, conducting, reporting and evaluating studies on AI in dentistry. Clinical significance: Current studies on AI in dentistry show considerable weaknesses, hampering their replication and application. This checklist may help to overcome this issue and advance AI research as well as facilitate a debate on standards in this fields.

It tried to simulate the fantasy navigation mode of moth lateral positioning. The basic MFO has no specific, deep strategies in different periods of the algorithm and a fragile evolutionary basis, which may lead to the problem of falling into local optimum and slow convergence trend. Therefore, this paper introduces a double adaptive weight mechanism into the MFO algorithm, termed as WEMFO, to boost the search capability of the basic MFO and provide a more efficient tool for optimization purposes. The proposed WEMFO adjusts the search strategy adaptively in different periods of the algorithm, making it more flexible between global search (diversification) and local search (intensification). The WEMFO algorithm is compared with some illustrious metaheuristic solvers and advanced metaheuristic methods developed in recent years on thirty benchmark functions. The experimental results expose that the developed WEMFO has apparent compensations in terms of convergence speed and solution accuracy. Moreover, this paper analyzes the diversity and balance of WEMFO and applies the algorithm to several engineering problems. The experimental results show that the WEMFO algorithm has good performance in engineering problems. Additionally, the proposed WEMFO was also applied to train Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), the resultant optimized WEMFO-KELM model was applied to six clinical disease classification problems. By comparing with MFO-KELM and other five classification models, the experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm had shown better performance in practical problems.

However, this explosion in research has resulted in a breadth of inferential strategies that both create opportunities for more reliable inference as well as complicate the choices that an applied researcher has to make and defend. Relatedly, researchers advocating for new methods typically compare their method to at best 2 or 3 other causal inference strategies and test using simulations that may or may not be designed to equally tease out flaws in all the competing methods. The causal inference data analysis challenge, "Is Your SATT Where It's At?", launched as part of the 2016 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference, sought to make progress with respect to both of these issues. The researchers creating the data testing grounds were distinct from the researchers submitting methods whose efficacy would be evaluated. Results from 30 competitors across the two versions of the competition (black-box algorithms and do-it-yourself analyses) are presented along with post-hoc analyses that reveal information about the characteristics of causal inference strategies and settings that affect performance. The most consistent conclusion was that methods that flexibly model the response surface perform better overall than methods that fail to do so. Finally new methods are proposed that combine features of several of the top-performing submitted methods.

J	Winter, R; Montanari, F; Noe, F; Clevert, DA				Winter, Robin; Montanari, Floriane; Noe, Frank; Clevert, Djork-Arne			Learning continuous and data-driven molecular descriptors by translating equivalent chemical representations	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SETS; CLASSIFICATION; TOXICITY	There has been a recent surge of interest in using machine learning across chemical space in order to predict properties of molecules or design molecules and materials with the desired properties. Most of this work relies on defining clever feature representations, in which the chemical graph structure is encoded in a uniform way such that predictions across chemical space can be made. In this work, we propose to exploit the powerful ability of deep neural networks to learn a feature representation from low-level encodings of a huge corpus of chemical structures. Our model borrows ideas from neural machine translation: it translates between two semantically equivalent but syntactically different representations of molecular structures, compressing the meaningful information both representations have in common in a low-dimensional representation vector. Once the model is trained, this representation can be extracted for any new molecule and utilized as a descriptor. In fair benchmarks with respect to various human-engineered molecular fingerprints and graph-convolution models, our method shows competitive performance in modelling quantitative structure-activity relationships in all analysed datasets. Additionally, we show that our descriptor significantly outperforms all baseline molecular fingerprints in two ligand-based virtual screening tasks. Overall, our descriptors show the most consistent performances in all experiments. The continuity of the descriptor space and the existence of the decoder that permits deducing a chemical structure from an embedding vector allow for exploration of the space and open up new opportunities for compound optimization and idea generation.

At the same time, the computer vision-based remote sensing image classification models are needed to monitor the modifications over time such as vegetation, inland water, bare soil or human infrastructure regardless of spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions. In this aspect, this paper proposes an ensemble of DL-based multimodal land cover classification (EDL-MMLCC) models using remote sensing images. The EDL-MMLCC technique aims to classify remote sensing images into the different cloud, shades, and land cover classes. Primarily, median filtering-based preprocessing and data augmentation techniques take place. In addition, an ensemble of DL models, namely VGG-19, Capsule Network (CapsNet), and MobileNet, is used for feature extraction. In addition, the training process of the DL models can be enhanced by the use of hosted cuckoo optimization (HCO) algorithm. Finally, the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) with regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) classifier is applied for land cover classification. The design of the HCO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization and SSA for parameter tuning of the RELM model helps to increase the classification outcome to a maximum level considerably. The proposed EDL-MMLCC technique is tested using an Amazon dataset from the Kaggle repository. The experimental results pointed out the promising performance of the EDL-MMLCC technique over the recent state of art approaches.

Despite considerable effort by the catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational catalyst discovery process, it remains an open challenge to build models that can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and adsorbate identity/configurations, perhaps because datasets have been smaller in catalysis than in related fields. To address this, we developed the OC20 dataset, consisting of 1,281,040 density functional theory (DFT) relaxations (similar to 264,890,000 single-point evaluations) across a wide swath of materials, surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistries). We supplemented this dataset with randomly perturbed structures, short timescale molecular dynamics, and electronic structure analyses. The dataset comprises three central tasks indicative of day-to-day catalyst modeling and comes with predefined train/validation/test splits to facilitate direct comparisons with future model development efforts. We applied three state-of-the-art graph neural network models (CGCNN, SchNet, and DimeNet++) to each of these tasks as baseline demonstrations for the community to build on. In almost every task, no upper limit on model size was identified, suggesting that even larger models are likely to improve on initial results. The dataset and baseline models are both provided as open resources as well as a public leader board to encourage community contributions to solve these important tasks.

J	Yang, X; Deng, C; Liu, TL; Tao, DC				Yang, Xu; Deng, Cheng; Liu, Tongliang; Tao, Dacheng			Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network for Unsupervised Multiple-Target Domain Adaptation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Semantics; Feature extraction; Adaptation models; Training; Task analysis; Machine learning; Data models; Heterogeneous graph learning; multiple-target domain adaptation; graph attention network		Domain adaptation, which transfers the knowledge from label-rich source domain to unlabeled target domains, is a challenging task in machine learning. The prior domain adaptation methods focus on pairwise adaptation assumption with a single source and a single target domain, while little work concerns the scenario of one source domain and multiple target domains. Applying pairwise adaptation methods to this setting may be suboptimal, as they fail to consider the semantic association among multiple target domains. In this work we propose a deep semantic information propagation approach in the novel context of multiple unlabeled target domains and one labeled source domain. Our model aims to learn a unified subspace common for all domains with a heterogeneous graph attention network, where the transductive ability of the graph attention network can conduct semantic propagation of the related samples among multiple domains. In particular, the attention mechanism is applied to optimize the relationships of multiple domain samples for better semantic transfer. Then, the pseudo labels of the target domains predicted by the graph attention network are utilized to learn domain-invariant representations by aligning labeled source centroid and pseudo-labeled target centroid. We test our approach on four challenging public datasets, and it outperforms several popular domain adaptation methods.

Landslide is an overwhelming natural as well as man-made disaster that causes loss of natural resources and human properties throughout the world. The present study aimed to assess and compare the prediction efficiency of different models in landslide susceptibility in the Kysuca river basin, Slovakia. In this regard, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory combining with the analytic network process (FDEMATEL-ANP), Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier were considered. Initially, a landslide inventory map was produced with 2000 landslide and non-landslide points by randomly divided with a ratio of 70%:30% for training and testing, respectively. The geospatial database for assessing the landslide susceptibility was generated with the help of 16 landslide conditioning factors by allowing for topographical, hydrological, lithological, and land cover factors. The ReliefF method was considered for determining the significance of selected conditioning factors and inclusion in the model building. Consequently, the landslide susceptibility maps (ISMS) were generated using the FDEMATEL-ANP, Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier models. Finally, the area under curve (AUC) and different arithmetic evaluation were used for validating and comparing the results and models. The results revealed that random forest (RF) classifier is a promising and optimum model for landslide susceptibility in the study area with a very high value of area under curve (AUC = 0.954), lower value of mean absolute error (MAE = 0.1238) and root mean square error (RMSE = 0.2555), and higher value of Kappa index (K = 0.8435) and overall accuracy (OAC = 922%).

This data stream will open up a vast array of opportunities to quantify a diversity of biochemical and structural vegetation properties. The processing requirements for such large data streams require reliable retrieval techniques enabling the spatiotemporally explicit quantification of biophysical variables. With the aim of preparing for this new era of Earth observation, this review summarizes the state-of-the-art retrieval methods that have been applied in experimental imaging spectroscopy studies inferring all kinds of vegetation biophysical variables. Identified retrieval methods are categorized into: (1) parametric regression, including vegetation indices, shape indices and spectral transformations; (2) nonparametric regression, including linear and nonlinear machine learning regression algorithms; (3) physically based, including inversion of radiative transfer models (RTMs) using numerical optimization and look-up table approaches; and (4) hybrid regression methods, which combine RTM simulations with machine learning regression methods. For each of these categories, an overview of widely applied methods with application to mapping vegetation properties is given. In view of processing imaging spectroscopy data, a critical aspect involves the challenge of dealing with spectral multicollinearity. The ability to provide robust estimates, retrieval uncertainties and acceptable retrieval processing speed are other important aspects in view of operational processing. Recommendations towards new-generation spectroscopy-based processing chains for operational production of biophysical variables are given.

J	Zhao, YH; Da, JW; Yan, JQ				Zhao, Yuehua; Da, Jingwei; Yan, Jiaqi			Detecting health misinformation in online health communities: Incorporating behavioral features into machine learning based approaches	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Health misinformation; Misinformation detection; Online health community	SOCIAL MEDIA; FAKE NEWS; INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION	Curbing the diffusion of health misinformation on social media has long been a public concern since the spread of such misinformation can have adverse effects on public health. Previous studies mainly relied on linguistic features and textual features to detect online health-related misinformation. Based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this study proposed that the features of online health misinformation can be classified into two levels: central-level and peripheral-level. In this study, a novel health misinformation detection model was proposed which incorporated the central-level features (including topic features) and the peripheral-level features (including linguistic features, sentiment features, and user behavioral features). In addition, the following behavioral features were introduced to reflect the interaction characteristics of users: Discussion initiation, Interaction engagement, Influential scope, Relational mediation, and Informational independence. Due to the lack of a labeled dataset, we collected the dataset from a real online health community in order to provide a real scenario for data analysis. Four types of misinformation were identified through the coding analysis. The proposed model and its individual features were validated on the real-world dataset. The model correctly detected about 85% of the health misinformation. The results also suggested that behavioral features were more informative than linguistic features in detecting misinformation. The findings not only demonstrated the efficacy of behavioral features in health misinformation detection but also offered both methodological and theoretical contributions to misinformation detection from the perspective of integrating the features of messages as well as the features of message creators.

Existing methods are primary to reduce the inter-domain shift between the domains, which however usually overlook the relations among target samples. This paper investigates into the intra-domain variations of the target domain and proposes a novel adaptation framework w.r.t three types of underlying invariance, i.e., Exemplar-Invariance, Camera-Invariance, and Neighborhood-Invariance. Specifically, an exemplar memory is introduced to store features of samples, which can effectively and efficiently enforce the invariance constraints over the global dataset. We further present the Graph-based Positive Prediction (GPP) method to explore reliable neighbors for the target domain, which is built upon the memory and is trained on the source samples. Experiments demonstrate that 1) the three invariance properties are complementary and indispensable for effective domain adaptation, 2) the memory plays a key role in implementing invariance learning and improves the performance with limited extra computation cost, 3) GPP can facilitate the invariance learning and thus significantly improves the results, and 4) our approach produces new state-of-the-art adaptation accuracy on three re-ID large-scale benchmarks.

However, existing identification methods of transcriptome subtypes are limited due to the relatively long detection period, the unattainability of tumor specimens via biopsy or surgery, and the fleeting nature of intralesional heterogeneity. In search of a superior model over previous ones, this study evaluated the efficiency of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)-based radiomics model to classify transcriptome subtypes in glioblastoma patients. Methods: This retrospective study retrieved patients from TCGA-GBM and IvyGAP cohorts with pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma, and separated them into different transcriptome subtypes groups. GBM patients were then segmented into three different regions of MRI: enhancement of the tumor core (ET), non-enhancing portion of the tumor core (NET), and peritumoral edema (ED). We subsequently used handcrafted radiomics features (n = 704) from multimodality MRI and two-level feature selection techniques (Spearman correlation and F-score tests) in order to find the features that could be relevant. Results: After the feature selection approach, we identified 13 radiomics features that were the most meaningful ones that can be used to reach the optimal results. With these features, our XGBoost model reached the predictive accuracies of 70.9%, 73.3%, 88.4%, and 88.4% for classical, mesenchymal, neural, and proneural subtypes, respectively. Our model performance has been improved in comparison with the other models as well as previous works on the same dataset. Conclusion: The use of XGBoost and two-level feature selection analysis (Spearman correlation and F-score) could be expected as a potential combination for classifying transcriptome subtypes with high performance and might raise public attention for further research on radiomics-based GBM models.

In this study, we generated susceptibility maps of forest fire using supervised machine learning method (support vector machine-SVM) and its comparison with a versatile machine learning algorithm (random forest-RF) and their ensembles. In order to achieve this, first of all, a forest fire inventory map was constructed using Serbian historical forest fire database, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS), Landsat 8 OLI and Worldview-2 satellite images, field surveys, and interpretation of aerial photo images. A total of 126 forest fire locations were identified and randomly divided by a random selection algorithm into two groups, including training (70%) and validation data sets (30%). Forest fire susceptibility maps were prepared using SVM, RF, and their ensemble models using the training dataset and 14 selected different conditioning factors. Finally, to explore the performance of the mentioned models we used the values for area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The results depicted that the ensemble model had an AUC = 0.848, followed by the SVM model (AUC = 0.844), and RF model (AUC = 0.834). According to achieved AUC results, it can be deduced that SVM, RF, and their ensemble method had satisfactory performance. The study was applied in the Tara National Park (West Serbia), a region of about 191.7 sq. km distinguished by a very high forest density and a large number of forest fires.

While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images. Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, video-level, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.

Within the Lack of Chest COVID-19 X-ray Dataset: A Novel Detection Model Based on GAN and Deep Transfer Learning	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						2019 novel coronavirus; deep transfer learning; machine learning; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; convolutional neural network; GAN	RECOGNITION	The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is putting healthcare systems across the world under unprecedented and increasing pressure according to the World Health Organization (WHO). With the advances in computer algorithms and especially Artificial Intelligence, the detection of this type of virus in the early stages will help in fast recovery and help in releasing the pressure off healthcare systems. In this paper, a GAN with deep transfer learning for coronavirus detection in chest X-ray images is presented. The lack of datasets for COVID-19 especially in chest X-rays images is the main motivation of this scientific study. The main idea is to collect all the possible images for COVID-19 that exists until the writing of this research and use the GAN network to generate more images to help in the detection of this virus from the available X-rays images with the highest accuracy possible. The dataset used in this research was collected from different sources and it is available for researchers to download and use it. The number of images in the collected dataset is 307 images for four different types of classes. The classes are the COVID-19, normal, pneumonia bacterial, and pneumonia virus. Three deep transfer models are selected in this research for investigation. The models are the Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18. Those models are selected for investigation through this research as it contains a small number of layers on their architectures, this will result in reducing the complexity, the consumed memory and the execution time for the proposed model. Three case scenarios are tested through the paper, the first scenario includes four classes from the dataset, while the second scenario includes 3 classes and the third scenario includes two classes. All the scenarios include the COVID-19 class as it is the main target of this research to be detected. In the first scenario, the Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 80.6% in testing accuracy. In the second scenario, the Alexnet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 85.2% in testing accuracy, while in the third scenario which includes two classes (COVID-19, and normal), Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 100% in testing accuracy and 99.9% in the validation accuracy. All the performance measurement strengthens the obtained results through the research.

Artificial Intelligence for Mental Health and Mental Illnesses: an Overview	CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS			English	Review						Technology; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Deep learning; Schizophrenia; Depression; Suicide; Bioethics; Research ethics	BIG DATA; MACHINE; DEPRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; CARE; PERFORMANCE; STATISTICS; PSYCHIATRY; DRIVEN	Purpose of Review Artificial intelligence (AI) technology holds both great promise to transform mental healthcare and potential pitfalls. This article provides an overview of AI and current applications in healthcare, a review of recent original research on AI specific to mental health, and a discussion of how AI can supplement clinical practice while considering its current limitations, areas needing additional research, and ethical implications regarding AI technology. Recent Findings We reviewed 28 studies of AI and mental health that used electronic health records (EHRs), mood rating scales, brain imaging data, novel monitoring systems (e.g., smartphone, video), and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup mental health illnesses including depression, schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, and suicide ideation and attempts. Collectively, these studies revealed high accuracies and provided excellent examples of AI's potential in mental healthcare, but most should be considered early proof-of-concept works demonstrating the potential of using machine learning (ML) algorithms to address mental health questions, and which types of algorithms yield the best performance. As AI techniques continue to be refined and improved, it will be possible to help mental health practitioners re-define mental illnesses more objectively than currently done in the DSM-5, identify these illnesses at an earlier or prodromal stage when interventions may be more effective, and personalize treatments based on an individual's unique characteristics. However, caution is necessary in order to avoid over-interpreting preliminary results, and more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care.

Sensors and AI Techniques for Situational Awareness in Autonomous Ships: A Review	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Review						Marine vehicles; Sensor systems; Artificial intelligence; Intelligent sensors; Global navigation satellite system; Positioning; camera; microphone; LiDAR; RADAR; machine learning; GNSS; sensor fusion; maritime	ANOMALY DETECTION; SYSTEM; TRACKING; NOISE; VISION; RADAR	Autonomous ships are expected to improve the level of safety and efficiency in future maritime navigation. Such vessels need perception for two purposes: to perform autonomous situational awareness and to monitor the integrity of the sensor system itself. In order to meet these needs, the perception system must fuse data from novel and traditional perception sensors using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This article overviews the recognized operational requirements that are imposed on regular and autonomous seafaring vessels, and then proceeds to consider suitable sensors and relevant AI techniques for an operational sensor system. The integration of four sensors families is considered: sensors for precise absolute positioning (Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)), visual sensors (monocular and stereo cameras), audio sensors (microphones), and sensors for remote-sensing (RADAR and LiDAR). Additionally, sources of auxiliary data, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) and external data archives are discussed. The perception tasks are related to well-defined problems, such as situational abnormality detection, vessel classification, and localization, that are solvable using AI techniques. Machine learning methods, such as deep learning and Gaussian processes, are identified to be especially relevant for these problems. The different sensors and AI techniques are characterized keeping in view the operational requirements, and some example state-of-the-art options are compared based on accuracy, complexity, required resources, compatibility and adaptability to maritime environment, and especially towards practical realization of autonomous systems.

The selected FS algorithms, correlation-based feature selection, mean decrease in accuracy, random forest (RF) based recursive feature elimination, and variable selection using random forest, were tested on the extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, RF, and recursive partitioningclassifiers, respectively. The results demonstrate that the selection of an appropriate FS method can be crucial to the performance of a machine learning classifier in terms of accuracy but also parsimony. In this scope, we propose a new metric to perform model selection named classification optimization score (COS) that rewards model simplicity and indirectly penalizes for increased computational time and processing requirements using the number of features for a given classification model as a surrogate. Our findings suggest that applying rigorous FS along with utilizing the COS metric may significantly reduce the processing time and the storage space while at the same time producing higher classification accuracy than using the initial dataset.

Various computational methods have dramatically reduced the time and cost of drug discovery. In this review, we firstly discussed roles of multiscale biomolecular simulations in identifying drug binding sites on the target macromolecule and elucidating drug action mechanisms. Then, virtual screening methods (e.g., molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, and QSAR) as well as structure- and ligand-based classical/de novo drug design were introduced and discussed. Last, we explored the development of machine learning methods and their applications in aforementioned computational methods to speed up the drug discovery process. Also, several application examples of combining various methods was discussed. A combination of different methods to jointly solve the tough problem at different scales and dimensions will be an inevitable trend in drug screening and design.

Multimodal deep learning models for early detection of Alzheimer's disease stage	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; FEATURE-SELECTION; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; BIOMARKERS; REPRESENTATION; VALIDATION; CRITERIA; PREDICT	Most current Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive disorders (MCI) studies use single data modality to make predictions such as AD stages. The fusion of multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD staging analysis. Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), and clinical test data to classify patients into AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores. Our models have identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) as top distinguished features, which are consistent with the known AD literature.

This aim of this study was to propose a new machine learning methodology for analyzing and predicting spatial patterns of forest fire danger with a case study of tropical forest fire at Lao Cai province (Vietnam). For this purpose, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database for the study area was established, including ten influencing factors (slope, aspect, elevation, land use, distance to road, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and humidity) and 257 fire locations. The relevance level of these factors with the forest fire was analyzed and assessed using the Mutual Information algorithm. Then, a new hybrid artificial intelligence model named as MARS-DFP, which was Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) optimized by Differential Flower Pollination (DFP), was proposed and used construct forest fire model for generating spatial patterns of forest fire. MARS is employed to build the forest fire model for generalizing a classification boundary that distinguishes fire and non-fire areas, whereas DFP, a metaheuristic approach, was utilized to optimize the model. Finally, global prediction performance of the model was assessed using Area Under the curve (AUC), Classification Accuracy Rate (CAR), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and various statistical indices. The result demonstrated that the predictive performance of the MARS-DFP model was high (AUC = 0.91 and CAR = 86.57%) and better to those of other benchmark methods, Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network, Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system, Radial Basis Function Neural Network. This fact confirms that the newly constructed MARS-DFP model is a promising alternative for spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility.

While advances in deep learning and computer vision have enabled markerless pose estimation in individual animals, extending these to multiple animals presents unique challenges for studies of social behaviors or animals in their natural environments. Here we present Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP), a machine learning system for multi-animal pose tracking. This system enables versatile workflows for data labeling, model training and inference on previously unseen data. SLEAP features an accessible graphical user interface, a standardized data model, a reproducible configuration system, over 30 model architectures, two approaches to part grouping and two approaches to identity tracking. We applied SLEAP to seven datasets across flies, bees, mice and gerbils to systematically evaluate each approach and architecture, and we compare it with other existing approaches. SLEAP achieves greater accuracy and speeds of more than 800 frames per second, with latencies of less than 3.5 ms at full 1,024 x 1,024 image resolution. This makes SLEAP usable for real-time applications, which we demonstrate by controlling the behavior of one animal on the basis of the tracking and detection of social interactions with another animal. SLEAP is a versatile deep learning-based multi-animal pose-tracking tool designed to work on videos of diverse animals, including during social behavior.

It contains basic building blocks of atomistic neural networks, manages their training, and provides simple access to common benchmark datasets. This allows for an easy implementation and evaluation of new models. For now, SchNetPack includes implementations of (weighted) atom-centered symmetry functions and the deep tensor neural network SchNet, as well as ready-to-use scripts that allow one to train these models on molecule and material datasets. Based on the PyTorch deep learning framework, SchNetPack allows one to efficiently apply the neural networks to large datasets with millions of reference calculations, as well as parallelize the model across multiple GPUs. Finally, SchNetPack provides an interface to the Atomic Simulation Environment in order to make trained models easily accessible to researchers that are not yet familiar with neural networks.

The current study evaluated whether other F-18-FDOPA PET radiomics features further improve performance and the contributions of each of these features to performance. Methods: Our study included 72 retrospectively selected, newly diagnosed glioma patients with F-18-FDOPA PET dynamic acquisitions. A set of 114 features, including conventional static features and dynamic features, as well as other radiomics features, were extracted and machine-learning models trained to predict IDH mutations and the 1p/19q codeletion. Models were based on a machine-learning algorithm built from stable, relevant, and uncorrelated features selected by hierarchic clustering followed by a bootstrapped feature selection process. Models were assessed by comparing area under the curve using a nested cross-validation approach. Feature importance was assessed using Shapley additive explanations values. Results: The best models were able to predict IDH mutations (logistic regression with L2 regularization) and the 1p/19q codeletion (support vector machine with radial basis function kernel) with an area under the curve of 0.831 (95% CI, 0.790-0.873) and 0.724 (95% CI, 0.669-0.782), respectively. For the prediction of IDH mutations, dynamic features were the most important features in the model (time to peak, 35.5%). In contrast, other radiomics features were the most useful for predicting the 1p/19q codeletion (up to 14.5% of importance for the small-zone low-gray-level emphasis). Conclusion: F-18-FDOPA PET is an effective tool for the noninvasive prediction of glioma molecular parameters using a full set of amino-acid PET radiomics features. The contribution of each feature set shows the importance of systematically integrating dynamic acquisition for prediction of the IDH mutations as well as developing the use of radiomics features in routine practice for prediction of the 1p/19q codeletion.

Gesture recognition using machine-learning methods is valuable in the development of advanced cybernetics, robotics and healthcare systems, and typically relies on images or videos. To improve recognition accuracy, such visual data can be combined with data from other sensors, but this approach, which is termed data fusion, is limited by the quality of the sensor data and the incompatibility of the datasets. Here, we report a bioinspired data fusion architecture that can perform human gesture recognition by integrating visual data with somatosensory data from skin-like stretchable strain sensors made from single-walled carbon nanotubes. The learning architecture uses a convolutional neural network for visual processing and then implements a sparse neural network for sensor data fusion and recognition at the feature level. Our approach can achieve a recognition accuracy of 100% and maintain recognition accuracy in non-ideal conditions where images are noisy and under- or over-exposed. We also show that our architecture can be used for robot navigation via hand gestures, with an error of 1.7% under normal illumination and 3.3% in the dark.

One of the common issues that affects raw data is class imbalance problem which refers to imbalanced distribution of values of the response variable. This issue is present in fraud detection, network intrusion detection, medical diagnostics, and a number of other fields where negatively labeled instances significantly outnumber positively labeled instances. Modern machine learning techniques struggle to deal with imbalanced data by focusing on minimizing the error rate for the majority class while ignoring the minority class. The goal of our paper is demonstrate the effects of class imbalance on classification models. Concretely, we study the impact of varying class imbalance ratios on classifier accuracy. By highlighting the precise nature of the relationship between the degree of class imbalance and the corresponding effects on classifier performance we hope to help researchers to better tackle the problem. To this end, we carry out extensive experiments using 10-fold cross validation on a large number of datasets. In particular, we determine that the relationship between the class imbalance ratio and the accuracy is convex. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, C; Liu, B; Wan, SH; Qiao, P; Pei, QQ				Chen, Chen; Liu, Bin; Wan, Shaohua; Qiao, Peng; Pei, Qingqi			An Edge Traffic Flow Detection Scheme Based on Deep Learning in an Intelligent Transportation System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Image edge detection; Cloud computing; Real-time systems; Machine learning; Object detection; Intelligent transportation systems; Computational modeling; Intelligent transportation system; edge computing; deep learning; traffic flow detection	INTERNET; MODEL	An intelligent transportation system (ITS) plays an important role in public transport management, security and other issues. Traffic flow detection is an important part of the ITS. Based on the real-time acquisition of urban road traffic flow information, an ITS provides intelligent guidance for relieving traffic jams and reducing environmental pollution. The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment. After that, the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is optimized by retraining the feature extractor for multiobject vehicle tracking. Then, we propose a real-time vehicle tracking counter for vehicles that combines the vehicle detection and vehicle tracking algorithms to realize the detection of traffic flow. Finally, the vehicle detection network and multiple-object tracking network are migrated and deployed on the edge device Jetson TX2 platform, and we verify the correctness and efficiency of our framework. The test results indicate that our model can efficiently detect the traffic flow with an average processing speed of 37.9 FPS (frames per second) and an average accuracy of 92.0% on the edge device.

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, HYPERBAND, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare HYPERBAND with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that HYPERBAND can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.

Commercialization and industrialization of microalgae biorefinery heavily rely on the capability and efficiency of large-scale cultivation of microalgae. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel technologies that can be used to monitor, automatically control, and precisely predict microalgae production. In light of this, innovative applications of the Internet of things (IoT) technologies in microalgae biorefinery have attracted tremendous research efforts. IoT has potential applications in a microalgae biorefinery for the automatic control of microalgae cultivation, monitoring and manipulation of microalgal cultivation parameters, optimization of microalgae productivity, identification of toxic algae species, screening of target microalgae species, classification of microalgae species, and viability detection of microalgal cells. In this critical review, cutting-edge IoT technologies that could be adopted to microalgae biorefinery in the upstream and downstream processing are described comprehensively. The current advances of the integration of IoT with microalgae biorefinery are presented. What this review discussed includes automation, sensors, lab-on-chip, and machine learning, which are the main constituent elements and advanced technologies of IoT. Specifically, future research directions are discussed with special emphasis on the development of sensors, the application of microfluidic technology, robotized microalgae, high throughput platforms, deep learning, and other innovative techniques.

Nevertheless, various challenges, especially its optimal scheduling for multiple conflicting objectives, are yet to be addressed properly. The existing multi-objective workflow scheduling approaches are still limited in many ways, e.g., encoding is restricted by prior experts' knowledge when handling a dynamic real-time problem, which strongly influences the performance of scheduling. In this paper, we apply a deep-Q-network model in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting to guide the scheduling of multi-workflows over infrastructure-as-a-service clouds. To optimize multi-workflow completion time and user's cost, we consider a Markov game model, which takes the number of workflow applications and heterogeneous virtual machines as state input and the maximum completion time and cost as rewards. The game model is capable of seeking for correlated equilibrium between make-span and cost criteria without prior experts' knowledge and converges to the correlated equilibrium policy in a dynamic real-time environment. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct extensive case studies based on multiple well-known scientific workflow templates and Amazon EC2 cloud. The experimental results clearly suggest that our proposed approach outperforms traditional ones, e.g., non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, multi-objective particle swarm optimization, and game-theoretic-based greedy algorithms, in terms of optimality of scheduling plans generated.

Ever-increasing big data, easy access to high-resolution imagery, and cloud-based analytics platforms like Google Earth Engine have drastically improved the ability for scientists to advance data-driven agriculture with improved algorithms for crop type mapping using remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Crop type mapping techniques mainly relied on standalone SAR and optical imagery, few studies investigated the potential of SAR-optical data fusion, coupled with virtual constellation, and 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning networks. To this extent, we use a deep learning approach that utilizes the denoised backscatter and texture information from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and the spectral information from multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data for mapping ten different crop types, as well as water, soil and urban area. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data was fused with multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data in an effort to improve classification accuracies for crop types. We compared the results of the 3D U-Net to the state-of-the-art deep learning networks, including SegNet and 2D U-Net, as well as commonly used machine learning method such as Random Forest. The results showed (1) fusing multi-temporal SAR and optical data yields higher training overall accuracies (OA) (3D U-Net 0.992, 2D U-Net 0.943, SegNet 0.871) and testing OA (3D U-Net 0.941, 2D U-Net 0.847, SegNet 0.643) for crop type mapping compared to standalone multi-temporal SAR or optical data (2) optical data fused with denoised SAR data via a denoising convolution neural network (OA 0.912) performed better for crop type mapping compared to optical data fused with boxcar (OA 0.880), Lee (OA 0.881), and median (OA 0.887) filtered SAR data and (3) 3D convolutional neural networks perform better than 2D convolutional neural networks for crop type mapping (SAR OA 0.912, optical OA 0.937, fused OA 0.992).

Modeling and validation were done on 111 shallow landslide locations using 20 conditioning factors tested by the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) technique. We assessed model performance with statistically based indexes, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). All four machine learning models that we tested yielded excellent goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, but the RF-RAF ensemble model (AUC = 0.936) outperformed the BA-RAF, RS-RAF (AUC = 0.907), and RAF (AUC = 0.812) models. The results also show that the Random Forest model significantly improved the predictive capability of the RAF-based classifier and, therefore, can be considered as a useful and an effective tool in regional shallow landslide susceptibility mapping.

Here, we develop a deep learning algorithm that can accurately detect breast cancer on screening mammograms using an "end-to-end" training approach that efficiently leverages training datasets with either complete clinical annotation or only the cancer status (label) of the whole image. In this approach, lesion annotations are required only in the initial training stage, and subsequent stages require only image-level labels, eliminating the reliance on rarely available lesion annotations. Our all convolutional network method for classifying screening mammograms attained excellent performance in comparison with previous methods. On an independent test set of digitized film mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM), the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.88, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.91 (sensitivity: 86.1%, specificity: 80.1%). On an independent test set of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images from the INbreast database, the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.95, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.98 (sensitivity: 86.7%, specificity: 96.1%). We also demonstrate that a whole image classifier trained using our end-to-end approach on the CBIS-DDSM digitized film mammograms can be transferred to INbreast FFDM images using only a subset of the INbreast data for fine-tuning and without further reliance on the availability of lesion annotations. These findings show that automatic deep learning methods can be readily trained to attain high accuracy on heterogeneous mammography platforms, and hold tremendous promise for improving clinical tools to reduce false positive and false negative screening mammography results.

The recent success of deep learning envisions a new generation of despeckling techniques that could outperform classical model-based methods. However, current deep learning approaches to despeckling require supervision for training, whereas clean SAR images are impossible to obtain. In the literature, this issue is tackled by resorting to either synthetically speckled optical images, which exhibit different properties with respect to true SAR images, or multitemporal SAR images, which are difficult to acquire or fuse accurately. In this article, inspired by recent works on blind-spot denoising networks, we propose a self-supervised Bayesian despeckling method. The proposed method is trained by employing only noisy SAR images and can, therefore, learn features of real SAR images rather than synthetic data. Experiments show that the performance of the proposed approach is very close to the supervised training approach on synthetic data and superior on real data in both quantitative and visual assessments.

The strategic use of artificial intelligence in the digital era: Systematic literature review and future research directions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Machine learning; Business strategy; Information technology; Literature review		Artificial Intelligence tools have attracted attention from the literature and business organizations in the last decade, especially by the advances in machine learning techniques. However, despite the great potential of AI technologies for solving problems, there are still issues involved in practical use and lack of knowledge as regards using AI in a strategic way, in order to create business value. In this context, the present study aims to fill this gap by: providing a critical literature review related to the integration of AI to organizational strategy; synthetizing the existing approaches and frameworks, highlighting the potential benefits, challenges and opportunities; presenting a discussion about future research directions. Through a systematic literature review, research articles were analyzed. Besides gaps for future studies, a conceptual framework is presented, discussed according to four sources of value creation: (i) decision support; (ii) customer and employee engagement; (iii) automation; and (iv) new products and services. These findings contribute to both theoretical and managerial perspectives, with extensive opportunities for generating novel theory and new forms of management practices.	[Borges, Aline F.

However, these algorithms remain a 'black box' in terms of how they generate the predictions from the input data. Also, high-performance deep learning requires large, high-quality training datasets. Here, we report the development of an understandable deep-learning system that detects acute intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and classifies five ICH subtypes from unenhanced head computed-tomography scans. By using a dataset of only 904 cases for algorithm training, the system achieved a performance similar to that of expert radiologists in two independent test datasets containing 200 cases (sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 95%) and 196 cases (sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 95%). The system includes an attention map and a prediction basis retrieved from training data to enhance explainability, and an iterative process that mimics the workflow of radiologists. Our approach to algorithm development can facilitate the development of deep-learning systems for a variety of clinical applications and accelerate their adoption into clinical practice.

However, the current ratio of ridesplitting in the ridesourcing services is relatively low and its influencing factors remain unrevealed. Therefore, this paper uses a machine learning method, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, to explore the nonlinear effects of built environment on the ridesplitting ratio of origin?destination pairs (census tract to census tract). The GBDT model also provides the relative importance ranking of all the built environment factors. The results indicate that distance to city center, land use diversity and road density are the key influencing factors of ridesplitting ratio. In addition, the non-linear thresholds of built environment factors are identified based on partial dependence plots, which could provide policy implications for the government and transportation network companies to promote ridesplitting.

Shallow landslides at the Ha Long area (Vietnam) were selected as a case study. For this regard, set of ten influencing factors (slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, landuse, distance to road, distance to river, soil type, distance to fault, and lithology) and 193 landslide polygons were prepared to construct a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for the study area. Using the collected database, the DNN with its potential of realizing complex functional mapping hidden in the data is used to generalize a decision boundary that separates the learning space into two distinct categories: landslide (a positive class) and non-landslide (a negative class). Experimental results point out that the utilized the Keras's deep learning model with the Adam optimization and the mean squared error lost function is the best with the prediction performance of 84.0%. The performance is better than those of the employed benchmark approaches of random forest, J48 decision tree, classification tree, and logistic model tree. We conclude that the Keras's deep learning model is a new tool for shallow susceptibility mapping at landslide-prone areas.

B.; Goyal, Manish Kumar			A novel framework for risk assessment and resilience of critical infrastructure towards climate change	TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE			English	Article						Risk; Climate change; Machine learning; Critical infrastructure		The persistent extreme weather events (floods, droughts, heatwaves, etc.) are increasing the risks towards critical infrastructure (C.I). Therefore, it is essential to enhance the resilience of our C.I to withstand such events in the present and future. Here, a review of current and projected impacts of climate change is conducted on extreme events and on possible implications on C.I is carried out, which suggests that such events can have a severe impact on C.Is. Also, two studies on the behaviour of precipitation extremes and temporal evolution of drought across India are carried out, taking into account the corresponding impacts on C.Is. It indicated that north-western, north-eastern westernmost regions and western Ghats are highly susceptible to floods and northern, central-eastern, western, and central regions are prone towards co-occurrence of floods and droughts. Also, a case study on Kharif paddy yield forecasting using different machine learning (ML) models is carried out, where the random forest was found to be the most suitable model for yield prediction. Finally, we put forward a robust framework for risk assessment and improving the resilience of C.Is based upon the principles of flexibility, diversity, and industrial ecology, incorporating both short-term and long-term impacts of climate risk.

Existing shallow learning-based and deep learning-based methods focus on mapping the HR-LR face pairs into a joint feature space where the resolution discrepancy is mitigated. However, little works consider how to extract and utilize the intermediate discriminative features from the noisy LR query faces to further mitigate the resolution discrepancy due to the resolution limitations. In this study, we desire to fully exploit the multi-level deep convolutional neural network (CNN) feature set for robust CRFR. In particular, our contributions are threefold. (i) To learn more robust and discriminative features, we desire to adaptively fuse the contextual features from different layers. (ii) To fully exploit these contextual features, we design a feature set-based representation learning (FSRL) scheme to collaboratively represent the hierarchical features for more accurate recognition. Moreover, FSRL utilizes the primitive form of feature maps to keep the latent structural information, especially in noisy cases. (iii) To further promote the recognition performance, we desire to fuse the hierarchical recognition outputs from different stages. Meanwhile, the discriminability from different scales can also be fully integrated. By exploiting these advantages, the efficiency of the proposed method can be delivered. Experimental results on several face datasets have verified the superiority of the presented algorithm to the other competitive CRFR approaches.

Repurposing/repositioning of approved drugs offers a relatively low-cost and high-efficiency approach toward rapid development of efficacious treatments. The emergence of large-scale, heterogeneous biological networks has offered unprecedented opportunities for developing in silico drug repositioning approaches. However, capturing highly non-linear, heterogeneous network structures by most existing approaches for drug repositioning has been challenging. Results: In this study, we developed a network-based deep-learning approach, termed deepDR, for in silico drug repurposing by integrating 10 networks: one drug-disease, one drug-side-effect, one drug-target and seven drug-drug networks. Specifically, deepDR learns high-level features of drugs from the heterogeneous networks by a multi-modal deep autoencoder. Then the learned low-dimensional representation of drugs together with clinically reported drug-disease pairs are encoded and decoded collectively via a variational autoencoder to infer candidates for approved drugs for which they were not originally approved. We found that deepDR revealed high performance [the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.908], outperforming conventional network-based or machine learning-based approaches. Importantly, deepDR-predicted drug-disease associations were validated by the ClinicalTrials.gov database (AUROC = 0.826) and we showcased several novel deepDR-predicted approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. risperidone and aripiprazole) and Parkinson's disease (e.g. methylphenidate and pergolide).

Deep learning-based classification of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression following trauma utilizing visual and auditory markers of arousal and mood	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Computer vision; deep learning; depression; digital biomarker; emergency department; landmark feature; posttraumatic stress; resilience; voice analysis	RESEARCH DOMAIN CRITERIA; FACIAL EXPRESSION; FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; FACE RECOGNITION; SELF-NARRATIVES; LANGUAGE USE; SPEECH; EMOTIONS; VOICE; INDICATORS	Background Visual and auditory signs of patient functioning have long been used for clinical diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Direct measurement and quantification of these signals can aim to improve the consistency, sensitivity, and scalability of clinical assessment. Currently, we investigate if machine learning-based computer vision (CV), semantic, and acoustic analysis can capture clinical features from free speech responses to a brief interview 1 month post-trauma that accurately classify major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods N = 81 patients admitted to an emergency department (ED) of a Level-1 Trauma Unit following a life-threatening traumatic event participated in an open-ended qualitative interview with a para-professional about their experience 1 month following admission. A deep neural network was utilized to extract facial features of emotion and their intensity, movement parameters, speech prosody, and natural language content. These features were utilized as inputs to classify PTSD and MDD cross-sectionally. Results Both video- and audio-based markers contributed to good discriminatory classification accuracy. The algorithm discriminates PTSD status at 1 month after ED admission with an AUC of 0.90 (weighted average precision = 0.83, recall = 0.84, and f1-score = 0.83) as well as depression status at 1 month after ED admission with an AUC of 0.86 (weighted average precision = 0.83, recall = 0.82, and f1-score = 0.82). Conclusions Direct clinical observation during post-trauma free speech using deep learning identifies digital markers that can be utilized to classify MDD and PTSD status.

J	Wang, L; Yoon, KJ				Wang, Lin; Yoon, Kuk-Jin			Knowledge Distillation and Student-Teacher Learning for Visual Intelligence: A Review and New Outlooks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Review						Training; Measurement; Computational modeling; Visualization; Task analysis; Knowledge transfer; Speech recognition; Knowledge distillation (KD); student-teacher learning (S-T); deep neural networks (DNN); visual intelligence	NETWORKS	Deep neural models, in recent years, have been successful in almost every field, even solving the most complex problem statements. However, these models are huge in size with millions (and even billions) of parameters, demanding heavy computation power and failing to be deployed on edge devices. Besides, the performance boost is highly dependent on redundant labeled data. To achieve faster speeds and to handle the problems caused by the lack of labeled data, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proposed to transfer information learned from one model to another. KD is often characterized by the so-called 'Student-Teacher' (S-T) learning framework and has been broadly applied in model compression and knowledge transfer. This paper is about KD and S-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim to provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on the recent progress of KD methods together with S-T frameworks typically used for vision tasks. In general, we investigate some fundamental questions that have been driving this research area and thoroughly generalize the research progress and technical details. Additionally, we systematically analyze the research status of KD in vision applications. Finally, we discuss the potentials and open challenges of existing methods and prospect the future directions of KD and S-T learning.

Computational Grounded Theory: A Methodological Framework	SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH			English	Article						computational text analysis; grounded theory; computational grounded theory; inductive analysis; unsupervised machine learning; supervised machine learning; natural language processing; word scores	TEXT ANALYSIS; POTENTIAL INTERRELATION; GREAT-BRITAIN; CULTURE; CONCRETENESS; NETWORKS; MEDIA; MODEL	This article proposes a three-step methodological framework called computational grounded theory, which combines expert human knowledge and hermeneutic skills with the processing power and pattern recognition of computers, producing a more methodologically rigorous but interpretive approach to content analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential research questions.

J	Ryan, K; Lengyel, J; Shatruk, M				Ryan, Kevin; Lengyel, Jeff; Shatruk, Michael			Crystal Structure Prediction via Deep Learning	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DISCOVERY; DESIGN; PHASES; INTERMETALLICS; CHEMISTRY; ATOMS	We demonstrate the application of deep neural networks as a machine-learning tool for the analysis of a large collection of crystallographic data contained in the crystal structure repositories. Using input data in the form of multiperspective atomic fingerprints, which describe coordination topology around unique crystallographic sites, we show that the neural-network model can be trained to effectively distinguish chemical elements based on the topology of their crystallographic environment. The model also identifies structurally similar atomic sites in the entire data set of similar to 50000 crystal structures, essentially uncovering trends that reflect the periodic table of elements. The trained model was used to analyze templates derived from the known crystal structures in order to predict the likelihood of forming new compounds that could be generated by placing elements into these structural templates in a combinatorial fashion. Statistical analysis of predictive performance of the neural-network model, which was applied to a test set of structures never seen by the model during training, indicates its ability to predict known elemental compositions with a high likelihood of success. In similar to 30% of cases, the known compositions were found among the top 10 most likely candidates proposed by the model. These results suggest that the approach developed in this work can be used to effectively guide the synthetic efforts in the discovery of new materials, especially in the case of systems composed of three or more chemical elements.

Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery.

To prevent losses resulting from tube growth and enable sustainable development, developing high-precision predictive algorithms for piping erosion is essential. Boosting is a classic algorithm that has been successfully applied to diverse computer vision tasks. Therefore, this work investigated the predictive performance of the Boosted Linear Model (BLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Boosted Generalized Linear Model (Boost GLM), and Deep Boosting models for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in Zarandieh Watershed located in the Markazi province of Iran. A piping inventory map including 152 piping erosion locations was prepared for algorithm training and testing. 18 initial predisposing factors (altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from river, drainage density, distance from road, rainfall, land use, soil type, bulk density, CEC, pH, clay, silt, sand, topographical position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI)) was derived from multiple remote sensing (RS) sources to determine the piping erosion prone areas. The most significant predisposing factors were selected using multi-collinearity analysis which indicates linear correlations between predisposing factors. Finally, the results were evaluated for Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive predictive values (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV), and Receiver Operation characteristic (ROC) curve. The best Sensitivity (0.80), Specificity (0.84), PPV (0.85), NPV (0.79), and ROC (0.93), were obtained by Deep Boosting model. The results of the piping erosion susceptibility study in agricultural land use showed that 41% of agricultural lands are very sensitive to piping erosion. This outcome will enable natural resource managers and local planners to assess and take effective decisions to minimize damages to agricultural land use by accurately identifying the most vulnerable areas. Hence, this research proved Deep Boosting model's ability for piping erosion susceptibility mapping in comparison to other popular methods such as BLM, BRT, and Boost GLM.

The improvement of biodiesel production requires a reliable model that accurately reflects the effects of input variables on output variables. In this study, an extreme learning machine integrated with cuckoo search algorithm was developed to predict and optimize the process parameters. This model will be useful for virtual experimentations in order to enhance biodiesel research and development. The optimum parameters of the microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification process conditions were obtained as follows: (1) methanol/oil ratio: 60%, (2) potassium hydroxide catalyst concentration: 0.84%(w/w), (3) stirring speed: 800 rpm, and (4) reaction time: 388 s. The corresponding Ceiba pentandra biodiesel yield was 96.19%. Three independent experiments were conducted using the optimum process parameters and the average biodiesel yield was found to be 95.42%. In conclusion, microwave irradiation-assisted transesterification is an effective method for biodiesel production because it is more energy-efficient, which will reduce the overall cost of biodiesel production.

A graph-convolutional neural network model for the prediction of chemical reactivity	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							AIDED SYNTHESIS DESIGN; ORGANIC-REACTIONS; RETROSYNTHESIS; SYSTEM; TOOL	We present a supervised learning approach to predict the products of organic reactions given their reactants, reagents, and solvent(s). The prediction task is factored into two stages comparable to manual expert approaches: considering possible sites of reactivity and evaluating their relative likelihoods. By training on hundreds of thousands of reaction precedents covering a broad range of reaction types from the patent literature, the neural model makes informed predictions of chemical reactivity. The model predicts the major product correctly over 85% of the time requiring around 100 ms per example, a significantly higher accuracy than achieved by previous machine learning approaches, and performs on par with expert chemists with years of formal training. We gain additional insight into predictions via the design of the neural model, revealing an understanding of chemistry qualitatively consistent with manual approaches.

The Pettitt test was employed to detect the abrupt change point in time frame, while the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's Innovative trend analysis were performed to analyze the rainfall trend. The Artificial Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) was employed to forecast the upcoming 15 years rainfall across India. We mapped the rainfall trend pattern for whole country by using the geo-statistical technique like Kriging in ArcGIS environment. Results show that the most of the meteorological divisions exhibited significant negative trend of rainfall in annual and seasonal scales, except seven divisions during. Out of 17 divisions, 11 divisions recorded noteworthy rainfall declining trend for the monsoon season at 0.05% significance level, while the insignificant negative trend of rainfall was detected for the winter and pre-monsoon seasons. Furthermore, the significant negative trend (-8.5) was recorded for overall annual rainfall. Based on the findings of change detection, the most probable year of change detection was occurred primarily after 1960 for most of the meteorological stations. The increasing rainfall trend had observed during the period 1901-1950, while a significant decline rainfall was detected after 1951. The rainfall forecast for upcoming 15 years for all the meteorological divisions' also exhibit a significant decline in the rainfall. The results derived from ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data exhibit that increasing/decreasing precipitation convective rate, elevated low cloud cover and inadequate vertically integrated moisture divergence might have influenced on change of rainfall in India. Findings of the study have some implications in water resources management considering the limited availability of water resources and increase in the future water demand.

Grader Variability and the Importance of Reference Standards for Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Diabetic Retinopathy	OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							RETINAL IMAGES; AGREEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; LEVEL	Purpose: Use adjudication to quantify errors in diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading based on individual graders and majority decision, and to train an improved automated algorithm for DR grading. Design: Retrospective analysis. Participants: Retinal fundus images from DR screening programs. Methods: Images were each graded by the algorithm, U.S. board-certified ophthalmologists, and retinal specialists. The adjudicated consensus of the retinal specialists served as the reference standard. Main Outcome Measures: For agreement between different graders as well as between the graders and the algorithm, we measured the (quadratic-weighted) kappa score. To compare the performance of different forms of manual grading and the algorithm for various DR severity cutoffs (e.g., mild or worse DR, moderate or worse DR), we measured area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Results: Of the 193 discrepancies between adjudication by retinal specialists and majority decision of ophthalmologists, the most common were missing microaneurysm (MAs) (36%), artifacts (20%), and misclassified hemorrhages (16%). Relative to the reference standard, the kappa for individual retinal specialists, ophthalmologists, and algorithm ranged from 0.82 to 0.91, 0.80 to 0.84, and 0.84, respectively. For moderate or worse DR, the majority decision of ophthalmologists had a sensitivity of 0.838 and specificity of 0.981. The algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.971, specificity of 0.923, and AUC of 0.986. For mild or worse DR, the algorithm had a sensitivity of 0.970, specificity of 0.917, and AUC of 0.986. By using a small number of adjudicated consensus grades as a tuning dataset and higher-resolution images as input, the algorithm improved in AUC from 0.934 to 0.986 for moderate or worse DR. Conclusions: Adjudication reduces the errors in DR grading. A small set of adjudicated DR grades allows substantial improvements in algorithm performance. The resulting algorithm's performance was on par with that of individual U.S. Board-Certified ophthalmologists and retinal specialists.

For the example of the electronic density of states of 132k organic molecules, three different neural network architectures: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and deep tensor neural network (DTNN) are trained and assessed. The inputs for the neural networks are the coordinates and charges of the constituent atoms of each molecule. Already, the MLP is able to learn spectra, but the root mean square error (RMSE) is still as high as 0.3 eV. The learning quality improves significantly for the CNN (RMSE = 0.23 eV) and reaches its best performance for the DTNN (RMSE = 0.19 eV). Both CNN and DTNN capture even small nuances in the spectral shape. In a showcase application of this method, the structures of 10k previously unseen organic molecules are scanned and instant spectra predictions are obtained to identify molecules for potential applications.

J	Walters, WP; Barzilay, R				Walters, W. Patrick; Barzilay, Regina			Applications of Deep Learning in Molecule Generation and Molecular Property Prediction	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							TRAINING SET; PUBCHEM; DESIGN; DATABASE; DOMAIN	CONSPECTUS: Recent advances in computer hardware and software have led to a revolution in deep neural networks that has impacted fields ranging from language translation to computer vision. Deep learning has also impacted a number of areas in drug discovery, including the analysis of cellular images and the design of novel routes for the synthesis of organic molecules. While work in these areas has been impactful, a complete review of the applications of deep learning in drug discovery would be beyond the scope of a single Account. In this Account, we will focus on two key areas where deep learning has impacted molecular design: the prediction of molecular properties and the de novo generation of suggestions for new molecules. One of the most significant advances in the development of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) has come from the application of deep learning methods to the prediction of the biological activity and physical properties of molecules in drug discovery programs. Rather than employing the expert-derived chemical features typically used to build predictive models, researchers are now using deep learning to develop novel molecular representations. These representations, coupled with the ability of deep neural networks to uncover complex, nonlinear relationships, have led to state-of-the-art performance. While deep learning has changed the way that many researchers approach QSARs, it is not a panacea. As with any other machine learning task, the design of predictive models is dependent on the quality, quantity, and relevance of available data. Seemingly fundamental issues, such as optimal methods for creating a training set, are still open questions for the field. Another critical area that is still the subject of multiple research efforts is the development of methods for assessing the confidence in a model. Deep learning has also contributed to a renaissance in the application of de novo molecule generation. Rather than relying on manually defined heuristics, deep learning methods learn to generate new molecules based on sets of existing molecules. Techniques that were originally developed for areas such as image generation and language translation have been adapted to the generation of molecules. These deep learning methods have been coupled with the predictive models described above and are being used to generate new molecules with specific predicted biological activity profiles. While these generative algorithms appear promising, there have been only a few reports on the synthesis and testing of molecules based on designs proposed by generative models. The evaluation of the diversity, quality, and ultimate value of molecules produced by generative models is still an open question. While the field has produced a number of benchmarks, it has yet to agree on how one should ultimately assess molecules "invented" by an algorithm.	[Walters, W.

AI was mainly introduced via artificial neural networks, developed in the early 1950s, and with its evolution into "computational learning models." Machine Learning analyzes and extracts features in larger data after exposure to examples; Deep Learning uses neural networks in order to extract meaningful patterns from imaging data, even deciphering that which would otherwise be beyond human perception. Thus, AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare systems and clinical practice of doctors all over the world. This is especially true for radiologists, who are integral to diagnostic medicine, helping to customize treatments and triage resources with maximum effectiveness. Related in spirit to Artificial intelligence are Augmented Reality, mixed reality, or Virtual Reality, which are able to enhance accuracy of minimally invasive treatments in image guided therapies by Interventional Radiologists. The potential applications of AI in IR go beyond computer vision and diagnosis, to include screening and modeling of patient selection, predictive tools for treatment planning and navigation, and training tools. Although no new technology is widely embraced, AI may provide opportunities to enhance radiology service and improve patient care, if studied, validated, and applied appropriately.

During image acquisition, the sensor encodes an intermediate representation of an object in the sensor domain, which is subsequently reconstructed into an image by an inversion of the encoding function. Image reconstruction is challenging because analytic knowledge of the exact inverse transform may not exist a priori, especially in the presence of sensor non-idealities and noise. Thus, the standard reconstruction approach involves approximating the inverse function with multiple ad hoc stages in a signal processing chain(4,5), the composition of which depends on the details of each acquisition strategy, and often requires expert parameter tuning to optimize reconstructionperformance. Here we present a unified framework for image reconstruction-automated transform by manifold approximation (AUTOMAP)-which recasts image reconstruction as a data-driven supervised learning task that allows a mapping between the sensor and the image domain to emerge from an appropriate corpus of training data. We implement AUTOMAP with a deep neural network and exhibit its flexibility in learning reconstruction transforms for various magnetic resonance imaging acquisition strategies, using the same network architecture and hyperparameters. We further demonstrate that manifold learning during training results in sparse representations of domain transforms along low-dimensional data manifolds, and observe superior immunity to noise and a reduction in reconstruction artefacts compared with conventional handcrafted reconstruction methods. In addition to improving the reconstruction performance of existing acquisition methodologies, we anticipate that AUTOMAP and other learned reconstruction approaches will accelerate the development of new acquisition strategies across imaging modalities.

The main aim of this research was to conduct a spatially prediction of the top soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and clay content using digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches in Borujen region, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari province, central Iran. To achieve this goal, a total of 334 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth. Three non-linear models including Cubist (Cu), Random Forest (RF), Regression Tree (RT) and a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) were used to link environmental covariates and the studied soil properties. The environmental covariates were obtained from a digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imagery (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper; ETM). The model was calibrated and validated by the 10-fold cross-validation approach. Root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were used to determine the performance of the models, and relative RMSE (RMSE%) was used to define prediction accuracy. According to the RMSE and R-2, Cu and RF resulted in the most accurate predictions for CCE (R-2 = 0.30 and RMSE = 9.52) and clay contents (R-2 = 0.15 and RMSE = 7.86), respectively, while both of RF and Cu models showed the highest performance to predict SOC content (R-2 = 0.55). Results showed that remote sensing covariates (Ratio Vegetation Index and band 4) were the most important variables to explain the variability of SOC and CCE content, but only topographic attributes were responsible for clay content variation. According to RMSE% results, it could be concluded that the best model is not necessarily able to make the most accurate estimation. This study recommended that more observations and denser sampling should be carried out in the entire study area. Alternatively, stratified sampling by elevation in homogeneous sub-areas was recommended. The stratified sampling probably will increase the performance of models.

While providing us considerable convenience, cloud-based computing and storage also bring us many security problems, such as the abuse of information collection and concentrated web servers in the cloud. Traditional intrusion detection systems and web application firewalls are becoming incompatible with the new network environment, and related systems with machine learning or deep learning are emerging. However, cloud-IoT systems increase attacks against web servers, since data centralization carries a more attractive reward. In this article, based on distributed deep learning, we propose a web attack detection system that takes advantage of analyzing URLs. The system is designed to detect web attacks and is deployed on edge devices. The cloud handles the above challenges in the paradigm of the Edge of Things. Multiple concurrent deep models are used to enhance the stability of the system and the convenience in updating. We implemented experiments on the system with two concurrent deep models and compared the system with existing systems by using several datasets. The experimental results with 99.410% in accuracy, 98.91% in true positive rate (TPR), and 99.55% in detection rate of normal requests (DRN) demonstrate the system is competitive in detecting web attacks.

This coefficient is an important parameter which is used in the design of foundation of civil engineering structures and also in the slope stability analysis. In this study, the main objective is to propose a hybrid machine learning approach named MLP-BBO for the prediction of the coefficient of consolidation of soft soil. This method is based on Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) and Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO). For this, a total number of 164 soil samples were collected from the Tan Vu-Lach Huyen highway project and Ha Noi-Hai Phong highway project sites. In the modeling, input parameters used include clay (%), moisture content (%), liquid limit (%), plastic limit (%), plasticity index (%), and liquidity index (%). To validate performance of the models, standard methods such as Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (r) were used. For the comparison of performance of the models, popular machine learning methods were used namely Backpropagation Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Networks (Bp-MLP Neural Nets), Radial Basis Functions Neural Networks (RBF-Neural Nets), Gaussian Process (GP), M5 Tree, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Results of the model study indicate that the proposed method MLP-BBO has the highest predictive capability (RMSE = 0.397, MAE = 0.302 and r = 0.827), followed by the SVR (RMSE = 0.403, MAE = 0.299 and r = 0.819), the Bp-MLP Neural Nets (RMSE = 0.478, MAE = 0.398 and r = 0.805), the RBF-Neural Nets (RMSE = 0.412, MAE = 0.281 and r = 0.804), the GP (RMSE = 0.440, MAE = 0.301 and r = 0.777), and the M5 Tree (RMSE = 0.494, MAE = 0.322 and r = 0.728), in the prediction of C, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that though performance of all applied models is good in the prediction of the coefficient of consolidation of soil but performance of the MLP-BBO is the best.

In this study, we applied a methodological framework to optimize the prediction of SOC stocks for the entire Brazilian territory and determine how the environmental heterogeneity of Brazil influences the SOC stocks distribution. We used a legacy dataset of 8227 soil profiles which consisted of 37,693 samples. For each profile, the vertical distribution of SOC and bulk density were interpolated to standard depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm) using mass preserving equal-area quadratic splines. The covariates database was composed of 74 variables including bioclimatic (temperature and precipitation) data, soil and biome maps, vegetation indexes and morphometric maps derived from a digital elevation model, with a 1 km spatial resolution. To obtain the best prediction performance, we tested four machine learning algorithms: Random Forests, Cubist, Generalized Linear Model Boosting and Support Vector Machines. Random Forests showed the best performance in predicting SOC stocks for all depths, with the highest performance at 30-60 cm for training (R-2 = 0.32) and validation (R-2 = 0.33); hence, it was selected for the spatial prediction of SOC stocks. The most important covariates selected by Random Forests using the recursive feature elimination were: soil class, sum of monthly mean temperature (SAMT), precipitation, slope height and vegetation indexes (NDVI, GPP). In total, Brazilian soils store approximately 71.3 PgC within the top 100 cm, where the first 0-30 cm contains almost 36 PgC. Approximately 31% of the total SOC stocks (22.2 PgC) occurs in protected areas (2.6 million km(2)), which are not subjected to land use pressure and carbon losses. Although the Amazon biome has the highest amount of stored SOC (36.1 PgC), its soils do not represent a good potential for carbon accumulation. Among soil classes, the Luvisols showed the lowest SOC density (6.45 kg m(-2)) and the Histosols presented the highest values (14.87 kg m(-2)). More than 57% of the total SOC was found in nutrient-poor, deep-weathered Ferralsols and Acrisols, which are the dominant soils in Brazil. The presented methodological framework covers all steps of prediction process, building maps with known accuracy and has great potential to be used in future soil carbon inventories at large scales. Concerning conservation issues, the results highlight the importance of nature reserves for protecting SOC in the long-term.

Background: Literature suggests that the safety (i.e., not crossing when unsafe) and efficiency (i.e., crossing when safe) of pedestrians' interactions with automated vehicles could increase if automated vehicles display their intention via an eHMI. Methods: Twenty-eight participants experienced an urban road environment from a pedestrian's perspective using a head-mounted display. The behavior of approaching vehicles (yielding, nonyielding), vehicle size (small, medium, large), eHMI type (1. baseline without eHMI, 2. front brake lights, 3. Knightrider animation, 4. smiley, 5. text [WALK]), and eHMI timing (early, intermediate, late) were varied. For yielding vehicles, the eHMI changed from a nonyielding to a yielding state, and for nonyielding vehicles, the eHMI remained in its nonyielding state. Participants continuously indicated whether they felt safe to cross using a handheld button, and "feel-safe" percentages were calculated. Results: For yielding vehicles, the feel-safe percentages were higher for the front brake lights, Knightrider, smiley, and text, as compared with baseline. For nonyielding vehicles, the feel-safe percentages were equivalent regardless of the presence or type of eHMI, but larger vehicles yielded lower feel-safe percentages. The Text eHMI appeared to require no learning, contrary to the three other eHMIs. Conclusion: An eHMI increases the efficiency of pedestrian-AV interactions, and a textual display is regarded as the least ambiguous.

Weakly Supervised Deep Learning for Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						deep learning; image segmentation; weak supervision; agriculture; Landsat; land cover classification	SATELLITE IMAGERY; COVER; ALGORITHM; PRODUCT	Accurate automated segmentation of remote sensing data could benefit applications from land cover mapping and agricultural monitoring to urban development surveyal and disaster damage assessment. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when segmenting natural images with huge labeled datasets, their successful translation to remote sensing tasks has been limited by low quantities of ground truth labels, especially fully segmented ones, in the remote sensing domain. In this work, we perform cropland segmentation using two types of labels commonly found in remote sensing datasets that can be considered sources of "weak supervision": (1) labels comprised of single geotagged points and (2) image-level labels. We demonstrate that (1) a U-Net trained on a single labeled pixel per image and (2) a U-Net image classifier transferred to segmentation can outperform pixel-level algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. While the high performance of neural networks is well-established for large datasets, our experiments indicate that U-Nets trained on weak labels outperform baseline methods with as few as 100 labels. Neural networks, therefore, can combine superior classification performance with efficient label usage, and allow pixel-level labels to be obtained from image labels.

The development of a reliable prediction model could offer insights in gold price fluctuations, behavior and dynamics and ultimately could provide the opportunity of gaining significant profits. In this work, we propose a new deep learning forecasting model for the accurate prediction of gold price and movement. The proposed model exploits the ability of convolutional layers for extracting useful knowledge and learning the internal representation of time-series data as well as the effectiveness of long short-term memory (LSTM) layers for identifying short-term and long-term dependencies. We conducted a series of experiments and evaluated the proposed model against state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models. The preliminary experimental analysis illustrated that the utilization of LSTM layers along with additional convolutional layers could provide a significant boost in increasing the forecasting performance.

SVM was founded based on the statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization. Despite the high prediction rate of this technique in a wide range of real applications, the efficiency of SVM and its classification accuracy highly depends on the parameter setting as well as the subset feature selection. This work proposes a robust approach based on a recent nature-inspired metaheuristic called multi-verse optimizer (MVO) for selecting optimal features and optimizing the parameters of SVM simultaneously. In fact, the MVO algorithm is employed as a tuner to manipulate the main parameters of SVM and find the optimal set of features for this classifier. The proposed approach is implemented and tested on two different system architectures. MVO is benchmarked and compared with four classic and recent metaheuristic algorithms using ten binary and multi-class labeled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MVO can effectively reduce the number of features while maintaining a high prediction accuracy.

However, so far, no retrospective studies exist for the journal. This study addresses this gap using a machine learning n-gram (bigram and trigram) analysis. The survey results find that the journal has contributed to 9517 topics, with 69 topics covered in at least 10 studies between 1984 and 2019. Through a co-occurrence analysis of bigram and trigram terms, this study reveals that the major topics in the journal converge to nine themes: international economics, development economics, regional and real estate economics, economic growth and development, financial economics, monetary economics, general economic equilibrium, international finance, and non-conventional finance and macroeconomics. This study concludes with key takeaways and suggestions for prospective authors intending to publish their best papers in EM.

J	Ho, Y; Wookey, S				Ho, Yaoshiang; Wookey, Samuel			The Real-World-Weight Cross-Entropy Loss Function: Modeling the Costs of Mislabeling	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Machine learning; class imbalance; oversampling; undersampling; ethnic stereotypes; social bias; maximum likelihood estimation; cross-entropy; softmax		In this paper, we propose a new metric to measure goodness-of-fit for classifiers: the Real World Cost function. This metric factors in information about a real world problem, such as financial impact, that other measures like accuracy or F1 do not. This metric is also more directly interpretable for users. To optimize for this metric, we introduce the Real-World-Weight Cross-Entropy loss function, in both binary classification and single-label multiclass classification variants. Both variants allow direct input of real world costs as weights. For single-label, multiclass classification, our loss function also allows direct penalization of probabilistic false positives, weighted by label, during the training of a machine learning model. We compare the design of our loss function to the binary cross-entropy and categorical cross-entropy functions, as well as their weighted variants, to discuss the potential for improvement in handling a variety of known shortcomings of machine learning, ranging from imbalanced classes to medical diagnostic error to reinforcement of social bias. We create scenarios that emulate those issues using the MNIST data set and demonstrate empirical results of our new loss function. Finally, we discuss our intuition about why this approach works and sketch a proof based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation.

In response, an Artificial Chemist is presented: the integration of machine-learning-based experiment selection and high-efficiency autonomous flow chemistry. With the self-driving Artificial Chemist, made-to-measure inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) in flow are autonomously synthesized, and their quantum yield and composition polydispersity at target bandgaps, spanning 1.9 to 2.9 eV, are simultaneously tuned. Utilizing the Artificial Chemist, eleven precision-tailored QD synthesis compositions are obtained without any prior knowledge, within 30 h, using less than 210 mL of total starting QD solutions, and without user selection of experiments. Using the knowledge generated from these studies, the Artificial Chemist is pre-trained to use a new batch of precursors and further accelerate the synthetic path discovery of QD compositions, by at least twofold. The knowledge-transfer strategy further enhances the optoelectronic properties of the in-flow synthesized QDs (within the same resources as the no-prior-knowledge experiments) and mitigates the issues of batch-to-batch precursor variability, resulting in QDs averaging within 1 meV from their target peak emission energy.

Automated EEG-based screening of depression using deep convolutional neural network	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Depression; EEG; Electroencephalogram	NONLINEAR FEATURES; DAMAGE DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE; BRAIN	In recent years, advanced neurocomputing and machine learning techniques have been used for Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based diagnosis of various neurological disorders. In this paper, a novel computer model is presented for EEG-based screening of depression using a deep neural network machine learning approach, known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed technique does not require a semi-manually-selected set of features to be fed into a classifier for classification. It learns automatically and adaptively from the input EEG signals to differentiate EEGs obtained from depressive and normal subjects. The model was tested using EEGs obtained from 15 normal and 15 depressed patients. The algorithm attained accuracies of 93.5% and 96.0% using EEG signals from the left and right hemisphere, respectively. It was discovered in this research that the EEG signals from the right hemisphere are more distinctive in depression than those from the left hemisphere. This discovery is consistent with recent research and revelation that the depression is associated with a hyperactive right hemisphere. An exciting extension of this research would be diagnosis of different stages and severity of depression and development of a Depression Severity Index (DSI). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the current deep computation model usually suffers from overfitting due to the lack of public available labeled training samples, limiting its performance for big data feature learning. Motivated by the idea of active learning, an adaptive dropout deep computation model (ADDCM) with crowdsourcing to cloud is proposed for industrial IoT big data feature learning in this paper. First, a distribution function is designed to set the dropout rate for each hidden layer to prevent overfitting for the deep computation model. Furthermore, the outsourcing selection algorithm based on the maximum entropy is employed to choose appropriate samples from the training set to crowdsource on the cloud platform. Finally, an improved supervised learning from multiple experts scheme is presented to aggregate answers given by human workers and to update the parameters of the ADDCM simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented model by comparing with the dropout deep computation model and other state-of-the-art crowdsourcing algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can prevent overfitting effectively and aggregate the labeled samples to train the parameters of the deep computation model with crowdsouring for industrial IoT big data feature learning.

Recent studies have shown that fire-induced problems damage shear connectors and change the behavior of composite systems. To predict the performance of connectors, experimental tests are generally conducted at elevated temperatures or fire conditions. However, these tests need plenty of time, cost, and effort. This paper aims to propose a soft computing (SC) approach to predict the behavior of angle shear connectors at elevated temperatures. For this purpose, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and a genetic algorithm (GA) are hybridized and a novel ANFIS-PSO-GA model is proposed. To evaluate the performance of the ANFIS-PSO-GA model, a radial basis function network (RBFN) along with an extreme learning machine (ELM) are also developed. Finally, the performance of the ANFIS-PSO-GA, RBFN, and ELM are compared in the terms of different statistical indicators. The results of the paper show that the SC approach is applicable in the behavior prediction of angle connectors at elevated temperatures. Besides, it was concluded that the ANFIS-PSO-GA model can provide better estimations of load and slip in comparison with those of RBFN and ELM models.

Philip			Fuzzy Broad Learning System: A Novel Neuro-Fuzzy Model for Regression and Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Broad learning system (BLS); classification; k-means; regression; Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system	RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINE; INFERENCE SYSTEM; NETWORKS; RULE; IDENTIFICATION; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM; EQUIVALENCE; CONTROLLER	A novel neuro-fuzzy model named fuzzy broad learning system (BLS) is proposed by merging the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system into BLS. The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhancement layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzzification outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k-means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership functions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefficients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some popular benchmarks for regression and classification, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches. The results indicate that fuzzy BLS outperforms other models involved. Moreover, fuzzy BLS shows advantages over neuro-fuzzy models regarding to the number of fuzzy rules and training time, which can ease the problem of rule explosion to some extent.

Previous studies have mentioned that if the blasting operation is not properly designed, it may lead to several environmental issues, such as ground vibration. This study presents various machine learning (ML) techniques, i.e., hybrid extreme learning machines (ELMs) with the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and Harris hawks optimization (HHO) for controlling and predicting ground vibrations resulting from mine blasting. Actually, the GOA-ELM and HHO-ELM models are improved versions of a previously developed ELM model, and they are able to provide higher performance capacity. For the proposed ML modeling, a database was established consisting of 166 datasets collected from Malaysian quarries. The efficacy of the proposed ML techniques was observed in the training stage as well as in the testing stage, and the results were evaluated against five parameters constituting the fitness criteria. The results showed that the GOA-ELM model delivered more accurate ground vibration values compared to the HHO-ELM model. The system error values of the GOA-ELM model for the training and testing datasets were 2.0239 and 2.8551, respectively. The coefficients of determination of the GOA-ELM model for the training and testing datasets were 0.9410 and 0.9105, respectively. It was concluded that the new hybrid model is able to forecast ground vibration resulting from mine blasting with high level of accuracy. The capabilities of this hybrid model can be extended further to mitigate other environmental issues caused by mine blasting.

In this field, data is the new resource, and knowledge is extracted from materials datasets that are too big or complex for traditional human reasoning-typically with the intent to discover new or improved materials or materials phenomena. Multiple factors, including the open science movement, national funding, and progress in information technology, have fueled its development. Such related tools as materials databases, machine learning, and high-throughput methods are now established as parts of the materials research toolset. However, there are a variety of challenges that impede progress in data-driven materials science: data veracity, integration of experimental and computational data, data longevity, standardization, and the gap between industrial interests and academic efforts. In this perspective article, the historical development and current state of data-driven materials science, building from the early evolution of open science to the rapid expansion of materials data infrastructures are discussed. Key successes and challenges so far are also reviewed, providing a perspective on the future development of the field.

A considerable amount of electricity is generated from renewable energy sources since the last decade. Among the potential renewable energies, photovoltaic (PV) has experienced enormous growth in electricity generation. A large number of PV systems have been installed in on-grid and off-grid systems in the last few years. The number of PV systems will increase rapidly in the future due to the policies of the government and international organizations, and the advantages of PV technology. However, the variability of PV power generation creates different negative impacts on the electric grid system, such as the stability, reliability, and planning of the operation, aside from the economic benefits. Therefore, accurate forecasting of PV power generation is significantly important to stabilize and secure grid operation and promote large-scale PV power integration. A good number of research has been conducted to forecast PV power generation in different perspectives. This paper made a comprehensive and systematic review of the direct forecasting of PV power generation. The importance of the correlation of the input-output data and the preprocessing of model input data are discussed. This review covers the performance analysis of several PV power forecasting models based on different classifications. The critical analysis of recent works, including statistical and machine-learning models based on historical data, is also presented. Moreover, the strengths and weaknesses of the different forecasting models, including hybrid models, and performance matrices in evaluating the forecasting model, are considered in this research. In addition, the potential benefits of model optimization are also discussed.

DeepOlf: Deep Neural Network Based Architecture for Predicting Odorants and Their Interacting Olfactory Receptors	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Deep learning; DeepOlf; machine learning; odorant	WEB SERVER; LIGANDS	Olfaction transduction mechanism is triggered by the binding of odorants to the specific olfactory receptors (OR's) present in the nasal cavity. Different odorants stimulate different OR's due to the difference in shape, physical and chemical properties. In this paper, a deep neural network architecture DeepOlf, based on molecular features and fingerprints of odorants and ORs, to predict whether a chemical compound is a potential odorant or not along with its interacting OR is proposed. Odorant identification and Odorant-OR interaction were modeled as a binary classification through multiple classifiers. The evaluation of these classifier's performance showed that the deep-neural network framework not only fits data with better accuracy in comparison to other classical methods (SVM, RF, k-NN) but also able to predict odorant-OR interactions more accurately. To our knowledge, this study is the first realization of deep learning ideas for the problem of odorant and interacting OR prediction. The accuracy of DeepOlf was found to be 94.83 and 99.92 percent for the prediction of odorants and Odorant-OR interactions respectively. Comparison of DeepOlf prediction with the existing SVM based prediction server, ODORactor, showed that better performance can be achieved with the proposed deep learning approach.

In the past few years, with the availability of large and diverse data sets, researchers have begun to explore methods to systematically inform turbulence models with data, with the goal of quantifying and reducing model uncertainties. This review surveys recent developments in bounding uncertainties in RANS models via physical constraints, in adopting statistical inference to characterize model coefficients and estimate discrepancy, and in using machine learning to improve turbulence models. Key principles, achievements, and challenges are discussed. A central perspective advocated in this review is that by exploiting foundational knowledge in turbulence modeling and physical constraints, researchers can use data-driven approaches to yield useful predictive models.

J	Niu, WJ; Feng, ZK				Niu, Wen-jing; Feng, Zhong-kai			Evaluating the performances of several artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY			English	Article						Runoff time series prediction; Artificial neural network; Adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system; Extreme learning machine; Support vector machine; Gaussian process regression		Accurate runoff forecasting plays an important role in guaranteeing the sustainable utilization and management of water resources. Artificial intelligence methods can provide new possibilities for runoff prediction when the underlying physical relationship cannot be explicitly obtained. However, few reports evaluate the performances of various artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management by far. To refill this research gap, the potentials of five artificial intelligence methods in daily streamflow series prediction are examined, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM). Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully choose the appropriate forecasting models based on the actual characteristics of the studied reservoir.

The ultimate goal of such a system is to automatically and robustly convert the image or video data into actionable information. This paper provides an overview of recent advances in computer vision techniques as they apply to the problem of civil infrastructure condition assessment. In particular, relevant research in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and structural engineering is presented. The work reviewed is classified into two types: inspection applications and monitoring applications. The inspection applications reviewed include identifying context such as structural components, characterizing local and global visible damage, and detecting changes from a reference image. The monitoring applications discussed include static measurement of strain and displacement, as well as dynamic measurement of displacement for modal analysis. Subsequently, some of the key challenges that persist toward the goal of automated vision-based civil infrastructure and monitoring are presented. The paper concludes with ongoing work aimed at addressing some of these stated challenges. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

However, the application of deep learning for network traffic control in wireless/heterogeneous networks is a relatively new area. With the evolution of wireless networks, efficient network traffic control such as routing methodology in the wireless backbone network appears as a key challenge. This is because the conventional routing protocols do not learn from their previous experiences regarding network abnormalities such as congestion and so forth. Therefore, an intelligent network traffic control method is essential to avoid this problem. In this article, we address this issue and propose a new, real-time deep learning based intelligent network traffic control method, exploiting deep Convolutional Neural Networks (deep CNNs) with uniquely characterized inputs and outputs to represent the considered Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) backbone. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposal achieves significantly lower average delay and packet loss rate compared to those observed with the existing routing methods. We particularly focus on our proposed method's independence from existing routing protocols, which makes it a potential candidate to remove routing protocol(s) from future wired/wireless networks.

Volleyball-specific skills and cognitive functions can discriminate players of different competitive levels. J Strength Cond Res 36(3): 813-819, 2022-The aim of this study was to investigate whether volleyball-specific skills, physical performance, and general cognitive functions differ between players of different competitive levels. Twenty-six female volleyball players competing at 2 different levels (n = 13, regional; n = 13, provincial) were tested on volleyball-specific skills (accuracy and technique of setting, passing, spiking, and serving), change of direction speed (COD) by the modified T-test, countermovement jump (CMJ) and general cognitive functions (executive control by Flanker task and perceptual speed by visual search task). Four machine learning models were tested to detect the best one to predict players' level. Regional players presented higher passing, spiking, serving accuracy (p < 0.05) and setting, passing, spiking, and serving technique (p < 0.05) than provincial players. Regional players had also better performance in COD and CMJ than provincial players (p < 0.05). Regional players presented lower response time than provincial players in both congruent and incongruent conditions of the Flanker task, and in both 10 items and 15 items conditions of the visual search task (p < 0.05). Decision tree classifier was the machine learning model with the highest performance to discriminate regional and provincial players (93% precision and 73% recall) by considering passing technique, congruent and incongruent condition of the Flanker task, 15 items and 10 items condition of the visual search task, and spiking technique. These findings demonstrated the importance of assessing volleyball-specific skills and cognitive functions as playing a role to discriminate players of different competitive levels.

This study focuses on understanding the regime change from lower to higher volatility identified with a Markov Switching AR model. Utilizing machine learning feature selection methods, economic indicators are chosen to best explain changes in volatility. Results show that volatility is affected by specific economic indicators and is sensitive to COVID-19 news. Both negative and positive COVID-19 information is significant, though negative news is more impactful, suggesting a negativity bias. Significant increases in total and idiosyncratic risk are observed across all industries, while changes in systematic risk vary across industry.

J	Wu, YK; Tan, HC; Qin, LQ; Ran, B; Jiang, ZX				Wu, Yuankai; Tan, Huachun; Qin, Lingqiao; Ran, Bin; Jiang, Zhuxi			A hybrid deep learning based traffic flow prediction method and its understanding	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow prediction; Recurrent neural network; Convolutional neural network; Attention model; Deep neural network visualization	NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL	Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently demonstrated the capability to predict traffic flow with big data. While existing DNN models can provide better performance than shallow models, it is still an open issue of making full use of spatial-temporal characteristics of the traffic flow to improve their performance. In addition, our understanding of them on traffic data remains limited. This paper proposes a DNN based traffic flow prediction model (DNN-BTF) to improve the prediction accuracy. The DNN-BTF model makes full use of weekly/daily periodicity and spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic flow. Inspired by recent work in machine learning, an attention based model was introduced that automatically learns to determine the importance of past traffic flow. The convolutional neural network was also used to mine the spatial features and the recurrent neural network to mine the temporal features of traffic flow. We also showed through visualization how DNN-BTF model understands traffic flow data and presents a challenge to conventional thinking about neural networks in the transportation field that neural networks is purely a "black-box" model. Data from open-access database PeMS was used to validate the proposed DNN-BTF model on a long-term horizon prediction task. Experimental results demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

DNA methylation profiling is an additional emerging tool that will serve as an adjunct to increase accuracy of pathological diagnosis. Genome-wide interrogation of DNA methylation signatures, in conjunction with machine learning methods, has allowed for the creation of clinical-grade classifiers, most prominently in central nervous system and soft tissue tumors. Tumor DNA methylation profiling has led to the identification of new entities and the consolidation of morphologically disparate cancers into biologically coherent entities, and it will progressively become mainstream in the future. In addition, DNA methylation patterns in circulating tumor DNA hold great promise for minimally invasive cancer detection and classification. Despite practical challenges that accompany any new technology, methylation profiling is here to stay and will become increasingly utilized as a cancer diagnostic tool across a range of tumor types.

Deep learning in ophthalmology: The technical and clinical considerations	PROGRESS IN RETINAL AND EYE RESEARCH			English	Review							OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; PLUS DISEASE DIAGNOSIS; MACULAR DEGENERATION; DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; GLOBAL PREVALENCE; HEART-DISEASE; AUTOMATED DETECTION; VISION IMPAIRMENT; IMAGE-ANALYSIS	The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the intemet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed.

Interpretability and explanation methods for gaining a better understanding of the problem-solving abilities and strategies of nonlinear ML, in particular, deep neural networks, are, therefore, receiving increased attention. In this work, we aim to: 1) provide a timely overview of this active emerging field, with a focus on "post hoc" explanations, and explain its theoretical foundations; 2) put interpretability algorithms to a test both from a theory and comparative evaluation perspective using extensive simulations; 3) outline best practice aspects, i.e., how to best include interpretation methods into the standard usage of ML; and 4) demonstrate successful usage of XAI in a representative selection of application scenarios. Finally, we discuss challenges and possible future directions of this exciting foundational field of ML.

Intelligent sampling through active learning (AL) heuristics provides a pathway for fast inference of essential vegetation variables by means of hybrid retrieval approaches, i.e., machine learning regression algorithms trained by radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. In this study we summarize AL theory and perform a brief systematic literature survey about AL heuristics used in the context of Earth observation regression problems over terrestrial targets. Across all relevant studies it appeared that: (i) retrieval accuracy of AL-optimized training data sets outperformed models trained over large randomly sampled data sets, and (ii) Euclidean distance-based (EBD) diversity method tends to be the most efficient AL technique in terms of accuracy and computational demand. Additionally, a case study is presented based on experimental data employing both uncertainty and diversity AL criteria. Hereby, a a simulated training data base by the PROSAIL-PRO canopy RTM is used to demonstrate the benefit of AL techniques for the estimation of total leaf carotenoid content (Cxc) and leaf water content (Cw). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was incorporated to minimize and optimize the training data set with AL. Training the GPR algorithm on optimally AL-based sampled data sets led to improved variable retrievals compared to training on full data pools, which is further demonstrated on a mapping example. From these findings we can recommend the use of AL-based sub-sampling procedures to select the most informative samples out of large training data pools. This will not only optimize regression accuracy due to exclusion of redundant information, but also speed up processing time and reduce final model size of kernel-based machine learning regression algorithms, such as GPR. With this study we want to encourage further testing and implementation of AL sampling methods for hybrid retrieval workflows. AL can contribute to the solution of regression problems within the framework of operational vegetation monitoring using satellite imaging spectroscopy data, and may strongly facilitate data processing for cloud-computing platforms.

However, GCNs are based on spectral filters, which are computationally costly and fail to suppress noise effectively. In addition, the current GCN-based methods are prone to oversmoothing (the representation of each node tends to be congruent) problems. To circumvent these problems, a novel semi-supervised locality-preserving dense graph neural network (GNN) with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) filters and context-aware learning (DARMA-CAL) is proposed for HSI classification. In this work, we introduce the ARMA filter instead of a spectral filter to apply to GNNs. The ARMA filter can better capture the global graph structure and is more robust to noise. More importantly, the ARMA filter can simplify calculations compared with the spectral filter. In addition, we show that the ARMA filter can be approximated by a recursive method. Furthermore, we propose a dense structure, which not only implements the ARMA filter in the structure, but is also locality-preserving. Finally, we design a layerwise context-aware learning mechanism to extract the useful local information generated by each layer of the dense ARMA network. The experimental results on three real HSI datasets show that DARMA-CAL outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods.

There are various extensions of k-means to be proposed in the literature. Although it is an unsupervised learning to clustering in pattern recognition and machine learning, the k-means algorithm and its extensions are always influenced by initializations with a necessary number of clusters a priori. That is, the k-means algorithm is not exactly an unsupervised clustering method. In this paper, we construct an unsupervised learning schema for the k-means algorithm so that it is free of initializations without parameter selection and can also simultaneously find an optimal number of clusters. That is, we propose a novel unsupervised k-means (U-k-means) clustering algorithm with automatically finding an optimal number of clusters without giving any initialization and parameter selection. The computational complexity of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm is also analyzed. Comparisons between the proposed U-k-means and other existing methods are made. Experimental results and comparisons actually demonstrate these good aspects of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm.

The validity of these models was evaluated using statistical methods such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Kappa index, accuracy, and the area under the success rate and predictive rate curves (AUC). Part of the landslide prone area of Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand, Himalaya, India was selected as the study area. Results indicate that the RFDT is the best model showing the highest predictive capability (AUC = 0.741) in comparison to RFANN (AUC = 0.710), RFSVM (AUC = 0.701), and RFNB (AUC = 0.640) models. The present study would be helpful in the selection of best model for landslide susceptibility mapping.

However, sensors might be unreliable due to inherent issues and/or environmental conditions. This article aims at detecting anomalies in measurements from sensors, identifying the faulty ones and accommodating them with appropriate estimated data, thus paving the way to reliable digital twins. More specifically, we propose a general machine-learning-based architecture for sensor validation built upon a series of neural-network estimators and a classifier. Estimators correspond to virtual sensors of all unreliable sensors (to reconstruct normal behaviour and replace the isolated faulty sensor within the system), whereas the classifier is used for detection and isolation tasks. A comprehensive statistical analysis on three different real-world data-sets is conducted and the performance of the proposed architecture validated under hard and soft synthetically-generated faults.

The latest global elevation data contains forest and building artifacts that limit its usefulness for applications that require precise terrain heights, in particular flood simulation. Here, we use machine learning to remove buildings and forests from the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model to produce, for the first time, a global map of elevation with buildings and forests removed at 1 arc second (similar to 30 m) grid spacing. We train our correction algorithm on a unique set of reference elevation data from 12 countries, covering a wide range of climate zones and urban extents. Hence, this approach has much wider applicability compared to previous DEMs trained on data from a single country. Our method reduces mean absolute vertical error in built-up areas from 1.61 to 1.12 m, and in forests from 5.15 to 2.88 m. The new elevation map is more accurate than existing global elevation maps and will strengthen applications and models where high quality global terrain information is required.

J	Xiang, ZR; Yan, J; Demir, I				Xiang, Zhongrun; Yan, Jun; Demir, Ibrahim			A Rainfall-Runoff Model With LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Learning	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; INFORMATION-SYSTEM; WATER-QUALITY	Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology.

J	Shen, CP				Shen, Chaopeng			A Transdisciplinary Review of Deep Learning Research and Its Relevance for Water Resources Scientists	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Review						deep learning; artificial intelligence; AI neuroscience; data mining; transformative	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SOIL-MOISTURE; PRECIPITATION ESTIMATION; GROUNDWATER LEVELS; EARTH OBSERVATION; GUIDED DATA; PART 2; PREDICTION	Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.

To reduce unnecessary surgical resections, we used artificial intelligence to build a model to identify T1 colorectal tumors at risk for metastasis to lymph node and validated the model in a separate set of patients. METHODS: We collected data from 3134 patients with T1 CRC treated at 6 hospitals in Japan from April 1997 through September 2017 ( training cohort). We developed a machine-learning artificial neural network (ANN) using data on patients' age and sex, as well as tumor size, location, morphology, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and histologic grade. We then conducted the external validation on the ANN model using independent 939 patients at another hospital during the same period (validation cohort). We calculated areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves (AUCs) for the ability of the model and US guidelines to identify patients with lymph node metastases. RESULTS: Lymph node metastases were found in 319 (10.2%) of 3134 patients in the training cohort and 79 (8.4%) of /939 patients in the validation cohort. In the validation cohort, the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.83, whereas the guidelines identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.73 (P <.001). When the analysis was limited to patients with initial endoscopic resection (n = 517), the ANN model identified patients with lymph node metastases with an AUC of 0.84 and the guidelines identified these patients with an AUC of 0.77 (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: The ANN model outperformed guidelines in identifying patients with T1 CRCs who had lymph node metastases. This model might be used to determine which patients require additional surgery after endoscopic resection of T1 CRCs.

FDA-regulated AI Algorithms: Trends, Strengths, and Gaps of Validation Studies	ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Radiology; Validation studies		Rationale and Objectives: To assess key trends, strengths, and gaps in validation studies of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)regulated imaging-based artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms. Materials and Methods: We audited publicly available details of regulated AI/ML algorithms in imaging from 2008 until April 2021. We reviewed 127 regulated software (118 AI/ML) to classify information related to their parent company, subspecialty, body area and specific anatomy type, imaging modality, date of FDA clearance, indications for use, target pathology (such as trauma) and findings (such as fracture), technique (CAD triage, CAD detection and/or characterization, CAD acquisition or improvement, and image processing/quantification), product performance, presence, type, strength and availability of clinical validation data. Pertaining to validation data, where available, we recorded the number of patients or studies included, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and/or receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, along with information on ground-truthing of use-cases. Data were analyzed with pivot tables and charts for descriptive statistics and trends. Results: We noted an increasing number of FDA-regulated AI/ML from 2008 to 2021. Seventeen (17/118) regulated AI/ML algorithms posted no validation claims or data. Just 9/118 reviewed AI/ML algorithms had a validation dataset sizes of over 1000 patients. The most common type of AI/ML included image processing/quantification (IPQ; n = 59/118), and triage (CADt; n = 27/118). Brain, breast, and lungs dominated the targeted body regions of interest. Conclusion: Insufficient public information on validation datasets in several FDA-regulated AI/ML algorithms makes it difficult to justify clinical applications since their generalizability and presence of bias cannot be inferred.

J	Rasp, S; Thuerey, N				Rasp, Stephan; Thuerey, Nils			Data-Driven Medium-Range Weather Prediction With a Resnet Pretrained on Climate Simulations: A New Model for WeatherBench	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						deep learning; machine learning; numerical weather forecasting	FORECASTS; DESIGN	Numerical weather prediction has traditionally been based on the models that discretize the dynamical and physical equations of the atmosphere. Recently, however, the rise of deep learning has created increased interest in purely data-driven medium-range weather forecasting with first studies exploring the feasibility of such an approach. To accelerate progress in this area, the WeatherBench benchmark challenge was defined. Here, we train a deep residual convolutional neural network (Resnet) to predict geopotential, temperature and precipitation at 5.625 degrees resolution up to 5 days ahead. To avoid overfitting and improve forecast skill, we pretrain the model using historical climate model output before fine-tuning on reanalysis data. The resulting forecasts outperform previous submissions to WeatherBench and are comparable in skill to a physical baseline at similar resolution. We also analyze how the neural network creates its predictions and find that, for the case studies analyzed, the model has learned physically reasonable correlations. Finally, we perform scaling experiments to estimate the potential skill of data-driven approaches at higher resolutions.

J	Zhou, J; Asteris, PG; Armaghani, DJ; Pham, BT				Zhou, Jian; Asteris, Panagiotis G.; Armaghani, Danial Jahed; Binh Thai Pham			Prediction of ground vibration induced by blasting operations through the use of the Bayesian Network and random forest models	SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Blasting; Ground vibration; Random forest; Bayesian network; Feature selection; Machine learning	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; OPEN-PIT MINE; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; ROCK FRAGMENTATION; FEASIBILITY; VELOCITY; AIR; STABILITY	The present study aims to compare the performance of two machine learning techniques that can unveil the relationship between the input and target variables and predict the ground vibration (peak particle velocity, PPV) due to quarry blasting. To this end, a Random Forest (RF) model and a Bayesian Network (BN) model were developed. Before developing these models, and in order to illustrate the necessity of proposing new intelligent systems, a new empirical equation is proposed, using maximum charge per delay and distance from the blastface. The results confirm that there is indeed a need to develop intelligent systems with more input parameters. Thus, a Feature Selection (FS) model is applied to decrease the dimensionality of data and remove the irrelevant data. The outputs of this technique set five parameters, hole depth, power factor, stemming, maximum charge per delay and distance from the blast-face, as the most important model inputs necessary to predict PPV. After constructing FS-BN and FS-RF models and comparing them under different conditions (i.e., computational cost, accuracy and robustness), it is found that the developed FS-RF model can be introduced as a new model in the field of blasting environmental issues. The accuracy level of the FS-RF model is quite high; 92.95% and 90.32% for the train and test stages, respectively, while 92.95% and 87.09% accuracy is calculated for train and test of the FS-BN model. Thus, both developed hybrid models can effectively unveil the relationships between the input and target variables.

J	Smith, R; Friston, KJ; Whyte, CJ				Smith, Ryan; Friston, Karl J.; Whyte, Christopher J.			A step-by-step tutorial on active inference and its application to empirical data	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Active inference; Computational neuroscience; Bayesian inference; Learning; Decision-making; Machine learning	BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION; FREE-ENERGY; BRAIN; MEMORY	The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in particular, are the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation tasks. Issues with class imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical datasets, with lesions often occupying a considerably smaller volume relative to the background. Loss functions used in the training of deep learning algorithms differ in their robustness to class imbalance, with direct consequences for model convergence. The most commonly used loss functions for segmentation are based on either the cross entropy loss, Dice loss or a combination of the two. We propose the Unified Focal loss, a new hierarchical framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based losses for handling class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on five publicly available, class imbalanced medical imaging datasets: CVC-ClinicDB, Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Breast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and Kidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19). We compare our loss function performance against six Dice or cross entropy-based loss functions, across 2D binary, 3D binary and 3D multiclass segmentation tasks, demon-strating that our proposed loss function is robust to class imbalance and consistently outperforms the other loss functions.

First, we discuss the demand for developing neuro-inspired architecture beyond today's von-Neumann architecture. Second, we summarize the various approaches to designing the neuromorphic hardware (digital versus analog, spiking versus nonspiking, online training versus offline training) and discuss why emerging nonvolatile memory is attractive for implementing the synapses in the neural network. Then, we discuss the desired device characteristics of the synaptic devices (e.g., multilevel states, weight update nonlinearity/asymmetry, variation/noise), and survey a few representative material systems and device prototypes reported in the literature that show the analog conductance tuning. These candidates include phase change memory, resistive memory, ferroelectric memory, floating-gate transistors, etc.Next, we introduce the crossbar array architecture to accelerate the weighted sum and weight update operations that are commonly used in the neuro-inspired machine learning algorithms, and review the recent progresses of array-level experimental demonstrations for pattern recognition tasks. In addition, we discuss the peripheral neuron circuit design issues and present a device-circuit-algorithm codesign methodology to evaluate the impact of nonideal device effects on the system-level performance (e.g., learning accuracy). Finally, we give an outlook on the customization of the learning algorithms for efficient hardware implementation.

Recently, Machine learning techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and other networks have been extensively used by hydrologists for rainfall-runoff modelling as well as for other fields of hydrology. However, deep learning methods such as the state-of-the-art for LSTM networks are little studied in hydrological sequence time-series predictions. We deployed ANN and LSTM network models for simulating the rainfall-runoff process based on flood events from 1971 to 2013 in Fen River basin monitored through 14 rainfall stations and one hydrologic station in the catchment. The experimental data were from 98 rainfall-runoff events in this period. In between 86 rainfall-runoff events were used as training set, and the rest were used as test set. The results show that the two networks are all suitable for rainfall-runoff models and better than conceptual and physical based models. LSTM models outperform the ANN models with the values of R-2 and NSE beyond 0.9, respectively. Considering different lead time modelling the LSTM model is also more stable than ANN model holding better simulation performance. The special units of forget gate makes LSTM model better simulation and more intelligent than ANN model. In this study, we want to propose new data-driven methods for flood forecasting.

This severely limits the practical application of these models in systems with dynamics governed by important rare events, such as chemical reactions and diffusion. We present an adaptive Bayesian inference method for automating the training of interpretable, low-dimensional, and multi-element interatomic force fields using structures drawn on the fly from molecular dynamics simulations. Within an active learning framework, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to accept the model prediction or to perform a first principles calculation to augment the training set of the model. The method is applied to a range of single- and multi-element systems and shown to achieve a favorable balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, while requiring a minimal amount of ab initio training data. We provide a fully open-source implementation of our method, as well as a procedure to map trained models to computationally efficient tabulated force fields.

Recent advancements in technology and machine learning algorithms have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG)-based BCI applications. EEG-based intelligent BCI systems can facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in human cognitive states under monotonous tasks, which is both beneficial for people in need of healthcare support and general researchers in different domain areas. In this review, we survey the recent literature on EEG signal sensing technologies and computational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensating for the gaps in the systematic summary of the past five years. Specifically, we first review the current status of BCI and signal sensing technologies for collecting reliable EEG signals. Then, we demonstrate state-of-the-art computational intelligence techniques, including fuzzy models and transfer learning in machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to detect, monitor, and maintain human cognitive states and task performance in prevalent applications. Finally, we present a couple of innovative BCI-inspired healthcare applications and discuss future research directions in EEG-based BCI research.

Genomic, proteomic, and structural studies have provided hundreds of new targets and opportunities for future drug discovery. This situation poses a major problem: the necessity to handle the big data generated by combinatorial chemistry. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning play a pivotal role in the analysis and systemization of larger data sets by statistical machine learning methods. Advanced AI-based sophisticated machine learning tools have a significant impact on the drug discovery process including medicinal chemistry. In this review, we focus on the currently available methods and algorithms for structure-based drug design including virtual screening and de novo drug design, with a special emphasis on AI- and deep-learning-based methods used for drug discovery.

Most existing algorithms can only handle unsupervised closed set domain adaptation (UCSDA), i.e., where the source and target domains are assumed to share the same label set. In this article, we target a more challenging but realistic setting: unsupervised open set domain adaptation (UOSDA), where the target domain has unknown classes that are not found in the source domain. This is the first study to provide learning bound for open set domain adaptation, which we do by theoretically investigating the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. The proposed learning bound has a special term, namely, open set difference, which reflects the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. Furthermore, we present a novel and theoretically guided unsupervised algorithm for open set domain adaptation, called distribution alignment with open difference (DAOD), which is based on regularizing this open set difference bound. The experiments on several benchmark data sets show the superior performance of the proposed UOSDA method compared with the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

In order for this protein engineering technique to be efficient, fast, and reliable, and also of relevance to synthetic organic chemistry, methodology development was and still is necessary. Following a description of early key contributions, this review focuses on recent developments. It includes optimization of molecular biological methods for gene mutagenesis and the design of efficient strategies for their application, resulting in notable reduction of the screening effort (bottleneck of directed evolution). When aiming for laboratory evolution of selectivity and activity, second-generation versions of Combinatorial Active-Site Saturation Test (CAST) and Iterative Saturation Mutagenesis (ISM), both involving saturation mutagenesis (SM) at sites lining the binding pocket, have emerged as preferred approaches, aided by in silico methods such as machine learning. The recently proposed Focused Rational Iterative Site-specific Mutagenesis (FRISM) constitutes a fusion of rational design and directed evolution. On-chip solid-phase chemical gene synthesis for rapid library construction enhances library quality notably by eliminating undesired amino acid bias, the future of directed evolution?

The increasing presence in a broad range of applications, and their increasing computing and processing capabilities make them a valuable attack target, such as malware designed to compromise specific loT devices. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning in detecting loT malware. Specifically, our approach uses RNN to analyze ARM-based loT applications' execution operation codes (OpCodes). To train our models, we use an loT application dataset comprising 281 malware and 270 benign ware. Then, we evaluate the trained model using 100 new loT malware samples (i.e. not previously exposed to the model) with three different Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) configurations. Findings of the 10-fold cross validation analysis show that the second configuration with 2-layer neurons has the highest accuracy (98.18%) in the detection of new malware samples. A comparative summary with other machine learning classifiers also demonstrate that the LSTM approach delivers the best possible outcome. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the mismatch between the fifth generation (5G) and the requirements of such massive IoT-enabled applications, there is a need for technological advancements and evolutions for wireless communications and networking toward the sixth-generation (6G) networks. 6G is expected to deliver extended 5G capabilities at a very high level, such as Tbps data rate, sub-ms latency, cm-level localization, and so on, which will play a significant role in supporting massive IoT devices to operate seamlessly with highly diverse service requirements. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, in this article, we present a comprehensive survey on 6G-enabled massive IoT. First, we present the drivers and requirements by summarizing the emerging IoT-enabled applications and the corresponding requirements, along with the limitations of 5G. Second, visions of 6G are provided in terms of core technical requirements, use cases, and trends. Third, a new network architecture provided by 6G to enable massive IoT is introduced, i.e., space-air-ground-underwater/sea networks enhanced by edge computing. Fourth, some breakthrough technologies, such as machine learning and blockchain, in 6G are introduced, where the motivations, applications, and open issues of these technologies for massive IoT are summarized. Finally, a use case of fully autonomous driving is presented to show 6G supports massive IoT.

In this work, we propose a framework called InterFaceGAN to interpret the disentangled face representation learned by the state-of-the-art GAN models and study the properties of the facial semantics encoded in the latent space. We first find that GANs learn various semantics in some linear subspaces of the latent space. After identifying these subspaces, we can realistically manipulate the corresponding facial attributes without retraining the model. We then conduct a detailed study on the correlation between different semantics and manage to better disentangle them via subspace projection, resulting in more precise control of the attribute manipulation. Besides manipulating the gender, age, expression, and presence of eyeglasses, we can even alter the face pose and fix the artifacts accidentally made by GANs. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth face identity analysis and a layer-wise analysis to evaluate the editing results quantitatively. Finally, we apply our approach to real face editing by employing GAN inversion approaches and explicitly training feed-forward models based on the synthetic data established by InterFaceGAN. Extensive experimental results suggest that learning to synthesize faces spontaneously brings a disentangled and controllable face representation.

Recently, ensemble-based techniques have become popular in flood susceptibility modelling due to their greater strength and efficiency in the prediction of flood locations. Thus, the aim of this study was to employ machine learning-based Reduced-error pruning trees (REPTree) with Bagging (Bag-REPTree) and Random subspace (RS-REPTree) ensemble frameworks for spatial prediction of flood susceptibility using a geographic information system (GIS). First, a flood spatial database was constructed with 363 flood locations and thirteen flood influencing factors, namely altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to rivers, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil, land use, lithology, and rainfall. Subsequently, correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) was used as the factor selection method for optimization of input factors. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, standard error (SE), confidence interval (CI) at 95%, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to validate and compare the performance of the models. Results show that the RS-REPTree model has the highest prediction capability for flood susceptibility assessment, with the highest area under (the ROC) curve (AUC) value (0.949, 0.907), the smallest SE (0.011, 0.023), and the narrowest CI (95%) (0.928-0.970, 0.863-0.952) for the training and validation datasets. It was followed by the Bag-REPTree and REPTree models, respectively. The results also proved the superiority of the ensemble method over using these methods individually.

Deep-Learning Convolutional Neural Networks Accurately Classify Genetic Mutations in Gliomas	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION; HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; GLIOBLASTOMA; OLIGODENDROGLIOMA; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; SURVIVAL; ROBUST	MR imaging data and molecular information were retrospectively obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archives for 259 patients with either low- or high-grade gliomas. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify IDH1 mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT promotor methylation status. Classification had high accuracy: IDH1 mutation status, 94%; 1p/19q codeletion, 92%; and MGMT promotor methylation status, 83%. The authors conclude that this shows the feasibility of a deep-learning CNN approach for the accurate classification of individual genetic mutations of both low- and high-grade gliomas and that the relevant MR imaging features acquired from an added dimensionality-reduction technique are concordant with existing literature, showing that neural networks are capable of learning key imaging components without prior feature selection or human directed training. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The World Health Organization has recently placed new emphasis on the integration of genetic information for gliomas. While tissue sampling remains the criterion standard, noninvasive imaging techniques may provide complimentary insight into clinically relevant genetic mutations. Our aim was to train a convolutional neural network to independently predict underlying molecular genetic mutation status in gliomas with high accuracy and identify the most predictive imaging features for each mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging data and molecular information were retrospectively obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archives for 259 patients with either low- or high-grade gliomas. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promotor methylation status. Principal component analysis of the final convolutional neural network layer was used to extract the key imaging features critical for successful classification. RESULTS: Classification had high accuracy: IDH1 mutation status, 94%; 1p/19q codeletion, 92%; and MGMT promotor methylation status, 83%. Each genetic category was also associated with distinctive imaging features such as definition of tumor margins, T1 and FLAIR suppression, extent of edema, extent of necrosis, and textural features. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that for The Cancer Imaging Archives dataset, machine-learning approaches allow classification of individual genetic mutations of both low- and high-grade gliomas. We show that relevant MR imaging features acquired from an added dimensionality-reduction technique demonstrate that neural networks are capable of learning key imaging components without prior feature selection or human-directed training.

Although a laboratory test is the current routine diagnostic tool, it is time-consuming, imposing a high cost and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. Computed tomography (CT) has thus far become a fast method to diagnose patients with COVID-19. However, the performance of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 was moderate. Accordingly, additional investigations are needed to improve the performance in diagnosing COVID-19. In this study is suggested a rapid and valid method for COVID-19 diagnosis using an artificial intelligence technique based. 1020 CT slices from 108 patients with laboratory proven COVID-19 (the COVID-19 group) and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases (the non-COVID-19 group) were included. Ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used to distinguish infection of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Among all networks, the best performance was achieved by ResNet-101 and Xception. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.02%; accuracy, 99.51%). Xception achieved an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 98.04%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 99.02%). However, the performance of the radiologist was moderate with an AUC of 0.873 (sensitivity, 89.21%; specificity, 83.33%; accuracy, 86.27%). ResNet-101 can be considered as a high sensitivity model to characterize and diagnose COVID-19 infections, and can be used as an adjuvant tool in radiology departments.

Improved prediction of fungal effector proteins from secretomes with EffectorP 2.0	MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						effector; EffectorP; effector prediction; fungal pathogens; machine learning; secretomes	GENOME SEQUENCE; SIGNAL PEPTIDES; PLANT; REVEALS; RUST; INSIGHTS; PATHOGENICITY; RESISTANCE; VIRULENCE; CHROMOSOMES	Plant-pathogenic fungi secrete effector proteins to facilitate infection. We describe extensive improvements to EffectorP, the first machine learning classifier for fungal effector prediction. EffectorP 2.0 is now trained on a larger set of effectors and utilizes a different approach based on an ensemble of classifiers trained on different subsets of negative data, offering different views on classification. EffectorP 2.0 achieves an accuracy of 89%, compared with 82% for EffectorP 1.0 and 59.8% for a small size classifier. Important features for effector prediction appear to be protein size, protein net charge as well as the amino acids serine and cysteine. EffectorP 2.0 decreases the number of predicted effectors in secretomes of fungal plant symbionts and saprophytes by 40% when compared with EffectorP 1.0. However, EffectorP 1.0 retains value, and combining EffectorP 1.0 and 2.0 results in a stringent classifier with a low false positive rate of 9%. EffectorP 2.0 predicts significant enrichments of effectors in 12 of 13 sets of infection-induced proteins from diverse fungal pathogens, whereas a small cysteine-rich classifier detects enrichment in only seven of 13. EffectorP 2.0 will fast track the prioritization of high-confidence effector candidates for functional validation and aid in improving our understanding of effector biology. EffectorP 2.0 is available at http://effectorp.csiro.au.

J	Bertsimas, D; Kallus, N				Bertsimas, Dimitris; Kallus, Nathan			From Predictive to Prescriptive Analytics	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						data-driven decision making; machine learning; stochastic optimization	REGRESSION; CONVERGENCE; SEARCH	We combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and operations research and management science (OR/MS) in developing a framework, along with specific methods, for using data to prescribe optimal decisions in OR/MS problems. In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization, we consider data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but also predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate how our proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems and prove that they are computationally tractable and asymptotically optimal under mild conditions, even when data are not independent and identically distributed and for censored observations. We extend these to the case in which some decision variables, such as price, may affect uncertainty and their causal effects are unknown. We develop the coefficient of prescriptiveness P to measure the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from an operations perspective. We demonstrate our approach in an inventory management problem faced by the distribution arm of a large media company, shipping 1 billion units yearly. We leverage both internal data and public data harvested from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to prescribe operational decisions that outperform baseline measures. Specifically, the data we collect, leveraged by our methods, account for an 88% improvement as measured by our coefficient of prescriptiveness.

Plant pathogens represent a major ecological niche of the class Dothideomycetes and they are known to infect most major food crops and feedstocks for biomass and biofuel production. Studying the ecology and evolution of Dothideomycetes has significant implications for our fundamental understanding of fungal evolution, their adaptation to stress and host specificity, and practical implications with regard to the effects of climate change and on the food, feed, and livestock elements of the agro-economy. In this study, we present the first large-scale, whole-genome comparison of 101 Dothideomycetes introducing 55 newly sequenced species. The availability of whole-genome data produced a high-confidence phylogeny leading to reclassification of 25 organisms, provided a clearer picture of the relationships among the various families, and indicated that pathogenicity evolved multiple times within this class. We also identified gene family expansions and contractions across the Dothideomycetes phylogeny linked to ecological niches providing insights into genome evolution and adaptation across this group. Using machine-learning methods we classified fungi into lifestyle classes with >95 % accuracy and identified a small number of gene families that positively correlated with these distinctions. This can become a valuable tool for genome-based prediction of species lifestyle, especially for rarely seen and poorly studied species.

Central to this issue is the black-box problem of AI, which impedes investments and is fast becoming a legal hazard for users. Explainable AI (XAI) is a recent paradigm to tackle such an issue. Being the backbone of the industry, the prognostic and health management (PHM) domain has recently been introduced into XAI. However, many deficiencies, particularly the lack of explanation assessment methods and uncertainty quantification, plague this young domain. In the present paper, we elaborate a framework on explainable anomaly detection and failure prognostic employing a Bayesian deep learning model and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to generate local and global explanations from the PHM tasks. An uncertainty measure of the Bayesian model is utilized as a marker for anomalies and expands the prognostic explanation scope to include the model's confidence. In addition, the global explanation is used to improve prognostic performance, an aspect neglected from the handful of studies on PHM-XAI. The quality of the explanation is examined employing local accuracy and consistency properties. The elaborated framework is tested on real-world gas turbine anomalies and synthetic turbofan failure prediction data. Seven out of eight of the tested anomalies were successfully identified. Additionally, the prognostic outcome showed a 19% improvement in statistical terms and achieved the highest prognostic score amongst best published results on the topic.

Prediction of occurrence of flash flood locations is very difficult due to sudden change in climatic condition and manmade factors. However, prior identification of flood susceptible areas can be done with the help of machine learning techniques for proper timely management of flood hazards. In this study, we tested four decision trees based machine learning models namely Logistic Model Trees (LMT), Reduced Error Pruning Trees (REPT), Naive Bayes Trees (NBT), and Alternating Decision Trees (ADT) for flash flood susceptibility mapping at the Haraz Watershed in the northern part of Iran. For this, a spatial database was constructed with 201 present and past flood locations and eleven flood-influencing factors namely ground slope, altitude, curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), land use, rainfall, river density, distance from river, lithology, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Statistical evaluation measures, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and Freidman and Wilcoxon signed-rank testswere used to validate and compare the prediction capability of the models. Results showthat the ADT model has the highest prediction capability for flash flood susceptibility assessment, followed by the NBT, the LMT, and the REPT, respectively. These techniques have proven successful in quickly determining flood susceptible areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motivated by the recent health science studies, this work investigates ways to identify malnutrition affected people and obese people by analyzing body weight and BMI from facial images by proposing a regression method based on the 50-layers Residual network architecture. For face detection, Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks have been employed. A system is created to evaluate BMI along with age and gender from human facial real-time images. Malnutrition and obesity are commonly determined with the help of BMI. In the previous works, height, weight, and BMI estimation through automatic means have predominantly focused on full-body images and videos of humans. The usage of facial images for estimating such traits have been given less importance. In order to facilitate the analysis, the dataset is cleaned along with metadata containing information about the persons height, weight, age, and gender. Gender-based analysis is performed for the prediction of BMI. Finally, an email containing the persons picture along with their details is sent to the concerned health officer.

J	Wang, K; Sun, WC				Wang, Kun; Sun, WaiChing			A multiscale multi-permeability poroplasticity model linked by recursive homogenizations and deep learning	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Dual-porosity; Data-driven modeling; Directed graph; Embedded discontinuity; Recurrent neural network; Multiscale method	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FINITE-ELEMENT METHODS; CAM-CLAY PLASTICITY; POROUS-MEDIA; STRONG DISCONTINUITIES; CONSTITUTIVE MODEL; GRANULAR-MATERIALS; WATER-RETENTION; POROSITY MODEL; FLOW	Many geological materials, such as shale, mudstone, carbonate rock, limestone and rock salt are multi-porosity porous media in which pores of different scales may co-exist in the host matrix. When fractures propagate in these multi-porosity materials, these pores may enlarge and coalesce and therefore change the magnitude and the principal directions of the effective permeability tensors. The pore-fluid inside the cracks and the pores of host matrix may interact and exchange fluid mass, but the difference in hydraulic properties of these pores often means that a single homogenized effective permeability tensor field is insufficient to characterize the evolving hydraulic properties of these materials at smaller time scale. Furthermore, the complexity of the hydro-mechanical coupling process and the induced mechanical and hydraulic anisotropy originated from the micro-fracture and plasticity at grain scale also makes it difficult to propose, implement and validate separated macroscopic constitutive laws for numerical simulations. This article presents a hybrid data-driven method designed to capture the multiscale hydro-mechanical coupling effect of porous media with pores of various different sizes. At each scale, data-driven models generated from supervised machine learning are hybridized with classical constitutive laws in a directed graph that represents the numerical models. By using sub-scale simulations to generate database to train material models, an offline homogenization procedure is used to replace the up-scaling procedure to generate cohesive laws for localized physical discontinuities at both grain and specimen scales. Through a proper homogenization procedure that preserves spatial length scales, the proposed method enables field-scale simulations to gather insights from meso-scale and grain-scale micro-structural attributes. This method is proven to be much more computationally efficient than the classical DEM-FEM or FEM2 approach while at the same time more robust and flexible than the classical surrogate modeling approach. Due to the usage of bridging-scale technique, the proposed model may provide multiple opportunities to incorporate different types of simulations and experimental data across different length scales for machine learning. Numerical issues will also be discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An artificial neural network is used for predictive analysis, in which numerical data are generated to train an intelligence algorithm and to optimize the prediction errors. Results show that the heat transfer of the system increases when the Reynolds number, permeability parameter, or volume fraction of nanoparticles increases. However, the functional forms of these dependencies are complex. In particular, increasing the nanoparticle concentration is found to have a nonmonotonic effect on entropy generation. The simulated and predicted data are subjected to particle swarm optimization to produce correlations for the shear stress and Nusselt number. This study demonstrates the capability of artificial intelligence algorithms in predicting the thermohydraulics and thermodynamics of thermal and solutal systems.

This study evaluated the potential of a new machine learning algorithm using gradient boosting on decision trees with categorical features support (i.e., CatBoost) for accurately estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data in humid regions of China. Two other commonly used machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were also assessed for comparison. Eight input combinations of daily meteorological data [including both complete and incomplete combinations of solar radiation (R-s), maximum and minimum temperatures (T-max and T-min), relative humidity (H-r) and wind speed (U)] from five weather stations during 2001-2015 in South China were applied for model training and testing. The results showed that all the three algorithms could achieve satisfactory accuracy for ET0 estimation in subtropical China using R-s, T-max and T-min, or U, H-r, T-max, and T-min as inputs, under the circumstances of lacking complete meteorological parameters. The increases in testing RMSE and MAPE over training RMSE and MAPE showed positive correlations with the number of input parameters to the machine learning models. For the local models, among the three algorithms, SVM offered the best prediction accuracy and stability with incomplete combinations of meteorological parameters as inputs, while CatBoost performed best with the complete combination of parameters. Patterns of the generalized models were almost the same as the local models, but the former ones showed less than 10% decreases in RMSE or MAPE in comparison with the latter ones. In addition, the computing time and memory usage for data processing of CatBoost were much less than those of RF and SVM. Overall, as a tree-based algorithm, CatBoost made significant improvements in accuracy, stability and computational cost when compared to RF. Therefore, the CatBoost algorithm has a very high potential for ET0 estimation in humid regions of China, and even possibly in other parts of the world with similar humid climates.

We synthesized a set of 2001 image segments from panoramic radiographs. Our reference test was the measured % of PBL. A deep feed-forward CNN was trained and validated via 10-times repeated group shuffling. Model architectures and hyperparameters were tuned using grid search. The final model was a seven-layer deep neural network, parameterized by a total number of 4,299,651 weights. For comparison, six dentists assessed the image segments for PBL. Averaged over 10 validation folds the mean (SD) classification accuracy of the CNN was 0.81 (0.02). Mean (SD) sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 (0.04), 0.81 (0.05), respectively. The mean (SD) accuracy of the dentists was 0.76 (0.06), but the CNN was not statistically significant superior compared to the examiners (p = 0.067/t-test). Mean sensitivity and specificity of the dentists was 0.92 (0.02) and 0.63 (0.14), respectively. A CNN trained on a limited amount of radiographic image segments showed at least similar discrimination ability as dentists for assessing PBL on panoramic radiographs. Dentists' diagnostic efforts when using radiographs may be reduced by applying machine-learning based technologies.

Specifically, the study examines each of these four technologies in depth, to understand their key elements, the domains in which they operate, and current use cases pertaining to these technologies. The adoption of these new-age technologies is expected to have an impact on the outcomes for firms and customers. However, these are dynamically evolving technologies that have not yet been completely explored and whose full potential has yet to be uncovered. This study presents some research questions that are pertinent to key entities (firms, customers, intermediaries, developers, and regulators), and which merit deeper investigation in the future. This study also highlights major areas that need managerial focus in the adoption of these new-age technologies.

Widespread diffusion and inclusion of information and communication technology (ICT) in modern equipment has advanced the concept of machine autonomy. This study seeks to understand the effect of trust required for elderly people to accept autonomous homecare systems instead of human support. It attempts to reveal how trust and personal characteristics can increase intent to adopt an autonomous system. In this regard, different trust models and literature on human psychology to adopt ICT driven system are explored and analyzed to develop a parsimonious trust disposition model for autonomous system. The study was conducted among elderly and disabled people in retirement homes and rehabilitation centers of different major cities of Ontario, Canada through random sampling by employing both experiment and survey. In the first phase, a structured and designed experiment was conducted in three retirement homes which included 159 elderly people and in two rehabilitation centers which included 20 disabled people. Then a survey-based empirical study was conducted among the same people with the structured questionnaire to answer the questions based on their perceptions of both receiving service from human beings and viewing the video about an autonomous system governed by ambient intelligence. This study reveals that elderly people can be motivated to develop trust in this less-familiar system if they both believe they can operate it and find a sense of belongingness and feelings of social interactivity from this seemingly living machine system. The findings of this study provide clear direction for academics and practitioners. This research indicates that elderly people must have control on using any system in the absence of human support while maintaining a more solitary life in a retirement home. However, the system must be easy to learn and operate. It should also be designed in such a way that can create and impart social feelings.

Due to these advancements, various new communication channels are being introduced, out of which the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a special category of IoT in which the medical devices communicate with each other for sharing sensitive data. These advancements help the healthcare industry to have better contact and care towards their patients. But they too have certain drawbacks since there are so many security and privacy issues like replay, man-in-the-middle, impersonation, privileged-insider, remote hijacking, password guessing, denial of service (DoS) attacks and malware attacks. When the sensitive data is being attacked by any of these attacks, there is a chance of losing the authorized data to the attacker or getting altered due to which the data is not available for the authorized users and customers. Machine learning algorithms are widely used in the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting and classifying the attacks at the network and host level in a dynamic manner. Many supervised and unsupervised algorithms have been designed by researchers from the area of machine learning and data mining to identify the reliable detection of an anomaly. However, the main challenge in the IDS models are changed in dynamic and random behavior of malicious attacks and designing a scalable solution that can handle this behavior. The rapid change in network behavior and the fast evolution of various attacks paved the way for evaluating various datasets that are generated over the years and to design different dynamic approaches. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to develop effective and efficient IDS in the IoMT environment to classify and predict unforeseen cyberattacks. The network parameter are preprocessed, optimized and tuned by hyperparameter selection methods. A comprehensive analysis of experiments in DNN with other machine learning algorithms are compared on the benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Through rigorous testing, it has proved that the proposed DNN model performs better than the existing machine learning approaches with an increase in accuracy by 15% and decreases in time complexity by 32%, which helps in faster alerts to avoid post effects of intrusion in sensitive cloud data storage.

This paper adopts a Machine Learning approach to assess the causal link between natural gas consumption and economic growth for both economies. A Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm with the interconnection of the sub-class is employed using yearly data from 1970 to 2018. The interconnections of the sub-classes are found for both economies, indicating evidence of causalities operating in both directions. In addition, the propagation over the seven eras is linear and homogeneously continue for Japan, while this effect meets a stabilization phase in the fifth era for Germany. The empirical findings claim strong support for the existence of a bidirectional causality between these variables in Germany and Japan, which is in line with the "feedback hypothesis". Although the strength of this bidirectional relationship is clear for both economies, its time propagation is expected to be longer for Japan. Accordingly, this study claims that the gas supply should be further strengthened to progressively replace the most polluting fuels (oil and coal) and ensure a feasible transition towards a renewable path.

J	Elmachtoub, AN; Grigas, P				Elmachtoub, Adam N.; Grigas, Paul			Smart "Predict, then Optimize"	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						prescriptive analytics; data-driven optimization; machine learning; linear regression	SAMPLE AVERAGE APPROXIMATION; INVERSE OPTIMIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; DRIVEN; ALGORITHMS; ANALYTICS; CARE	Many real-world analytics problems involve two significant challenges: prediction and optimization. Because of the typically complex nature of each challenge, the standard paradigm is predict-then-optimize. By and large, machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions will be used in the downstream optimization problem. In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart "Predict, then Optimize" (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure-that is, its objective and constraints-for designing better prediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function, which measures the decision error induced by a prediction. Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally challenging, and, thus, we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss function, which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+ loss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild conditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex, or even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical experiments on shortest-path and portfolio-optimization problems show that the SPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the predict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular, when the prediction model being trained is misspecified. We find that linear models trained using SPO+ loss tend to dominate random-forest algorithms, even when the ground truth is highly nonlinear.

Remote Sensing Approaches for Monitoring Mangrove Species, Structure, and Biomass: Opportunities and Challenges	REMOTE SENSING			English	Review						mangrove species; mapping; biomass; blue carbon; machine learning; REDD	LEAF-AREA INDEX; ABOVEGROUND FOREST BIOMASS; INTERFEROMETRIC SAR DATA; ALOS-2 PALSAR IMAGERY; OBJECT-BASED APPROACH; AIRBORNE LIDAR DATA; HAI PHONG CITY; CARBON STOCKS; L-BAND; BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS	The mangrove ecosystem plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, mangroves have been lost worldwide, resulting in substantial carbon stock losses. Additionally, some aspects of the mangrove ecosystem remain poorly characterized compared to other forest ecosystems due to practical difficulties in measuring and monitoring mangrove biomass and their carbon stocks. Without a quantitative method for effectively monitoring biophysical parameters and carbon stocks in mangroves, robust policies and actions for sustainably conserving mangroves in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation are more difficult. In this context, remote sensing provides an important tool for monitoring mangroves and identifying attributes such as species, biomass, and carbon stocks. A wide range of studies is based on optical imagery (aerial photography, multispectral, and hyperspectral) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Remote sensing approaches have been proven effective for mapping mangrove species, estimating their biomass, and assessing changes in their extent. This review provides an overview of the techniques that are currently being used to map various attributes of mangroves, summarizes the studies that have been undertaken since 2010 on a variety of remote sensing applications for monitoring mangroves, and addresses the limitations of these studies. We see several key future directions for the potential use of remote sensing techniques combined with machine learning techniques for mapping mangrove areas and species, and evaluating their biomass and carbon stocks.

J	Xu, JB; McPartlon, M; Li, J				Xu, Jinbo; McPartlon, Matthew; Li, Jin			Improved protein structure prediction by deep learning irrespective of co-evolution information	NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							RESIDUE-RESIDUE CONTACTS; COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN; SEQUENCE; NETWORKS	Predicting the tertiary structure of a protein from its primary sequence has been greatly improved by integrating deep learning and co-evolutionary analysis, as shown in CASP13 and CASP14. We describe our latest study of this idea, analysing the efficacy of network size and co-evolution data and its performance on both natural and designed proteins. We show that a large ResNet (convolutional residual neural networks) can predict structures of correct folds for 26 out of 32 CASP13 free-modelling targets and L/5 long-range contacts with precision over 80%. When co-evolution is not used, ResNet can still predict structures of correct folds for 18 CASP13 free-modelling targets, greatly exceeding previous methods that do not use co-evolution either. Even with only the primary sequence, ResNet can predict the structures of correct folds for all tested human-designed proteins. In addition, ResNet may fare better for the designed proteins when trained without co-evolution than with co-evolution. These results suggest that ResNet does not simply de-noise co-evolution signals, but instead may learn important protein sequence-structure relationships. This has important implications for protein design and engineering, especially when co-evolutionary data are unavailable. In the last few years, computational protein structure prediction has greatly advanced by combining deep learning including convolutional residual networks (ResNet) with co-evolution data. A new study finds that using deeper and wider ResNets improves predictions in the absence of co-evolution information, suggesting that the ResNets do not not simply de-noise co-evolution signals, but instead may learn important protein sequence-structure relationships.

As the demands of performance and integration level keep increasing, the design and optimization of nanophotonic devices become computationally expensive and time-inefficient. Advanced computational methods and artificial intelligence, especially its subfield of machine learning, have led to revolutionary development in many applications, such as web searches, computer vision, and speech/image recognition. The complex models and algorithms help to exploit the enormous parameter space in a highly efficient way. In this review, we summarize the recent advances on the emerging field where nanophotonics and machine learning blend. We provide an overview of different computational methods, with the focus on deep learning, for the nanophotonic inverse design. The implementation of deep neural networks with photonic platforms is also discussed. This review aims at sketching an illustration of the nanophotonic design with machine learning and giving a perspective on the future tasks.

Heartbeat classification fusing temporal and morphological information of ECGs via ensemble of classifiers	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electrocardiogram (ECG); Heartbeat classification; Support vector machine (SVM); Combining classifiers; Ensemble of classifiers	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SIGNAL	A method for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECG) based on the combination of multiple Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is presented in this work. The method relies on the time intervals between consequent beats and their morphology for the ECG characterisation. Different descriptors based on wavelets, local binary patterns (LBP), higher order statistics (HOS) and several amplitude values were employed. Instead of concatenating all these features to feed a single SVM model, we propose to train specific SVM models for each type of feature. In order to obtain the final prediction, the decisions of the different models are combined with the product, sum, and majority rules. The designed methodology approaches are tested on the public MIT-131H arrhythmia database, classifying four kinds of abnormal and normal beats. Our approach based on an ensemble of SVMs offered a satisfactory performance, improving the results when compared to a single SVM model using the same features. Additionally, our approach also showed better results in comparison with previous machine learning approaches of the state-of-the-art. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Soil reflectance spectroscopy has been applied in various domains apart from laboratory conditions, e.g., sensors mounted on satellites, aircrafts and Unmanned Aerial Systems. The aim of this review is to illustrate the research made for soil organic carbon estimation, with the use of RS techniques, reporting the methodology and results of each study. It also aims to provide a comprehensive introduction in soil spectroscopy for those who are less conversant with the subject. In total, 28 journal articles were selected and further analysed. It was observed that prediction accuracy reduces from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to satellite platforms, though advances in machine learning techniques could further assist in the generation of better calibration models. There are some challenges concerning atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections, vegetation cover, soil moisture and roughness that still need to be addressed. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are highlighted and future considerations are also discussed at the end.

Existing works commonly apply extra operations like pose estimation, part segmentation, etc., to alleviate those issues and improve the robustness of pedestrian representations. While boosting the ReID accuracy, those operations introduce considerable computational overheads and make the deep models complex and hard to tune. To chase a more efficient solution, we propose a Part-Guided Representation (PGR) composed of Pose Invariant Feature (PIF) and Local Descriptive Feature (LDF), respectively. We call PGR "Part-Guided" because it is trained and supervised by local part cues. Specifically, PIF approximates a pose invariant representation inferred by pose estimation and pose normalization. LDF focuses on discriminative body parts by approximating a representation learned with body region segmentation. In this way, extra pose extraction is only introduced during the training stage to supervise the learning of PGR, but is not required during the testing stage for feature extraction. Extensive comparisons with recent works on five widely used datasets demonstrate the competitive accuracy and efficiency of PGR.

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecasting model for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed. An experiment that is based on the recent coronavirus outbreak originated from Wuhan is conducted by applying this methodology. It is shown that an optimized forecasting model that is constructed from a new algorithm, namely polynomial neural network with corrective feedback (PNN+cf) is able to make a forecast that has relatively the lowest prediction error. The results showcase that the newly proposed methodology and PNN+cf are useful in generating acceptable forecast upon the critical time of disease outbreak when the samples are far from abundant.

If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention. This article serves as a comprehensive reference to understand the current technological progress in anomaly detection of energy consumption based on artificial intelligence.

DeepAMD: Detection and identification of Android malware using high-efficient Deep Artificial Neural Network	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Android malware; Malware family; Malware category; API calls; Deep learning; Machine learning; Cyberattack; Security		Android smartphones are being utilized by a vast majority of users for everyday planning, data exchanges, correspondences, social interaction, business execution, bank transactions, and almost in each walk of everyday lives. With the expansion of human reliance on smartphone technology, cyberattacks against these devices have surged exponentially. Smartphone applications use permissions to utilize various functionalities of the smartphone that can be maneuvered to launch an attack or inject malware by hackers. Existing studies present various approaches to detect Android malware but lack early detection and identification. Accordingly, there is a dire need to craft an efficient mechanism for malicious applications' detection before they exploit the data. In this paper, a novel approach DeepAMD to defend against real-world Android malware using deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been adopted including an efficiency comparison of DeepAMD with conventional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art studies based on performance measures such as accuracy, recall, f-score, and precision. As per the experimental analysis, DeepAMD outperforms other approaches in detecting and identifying malware attacks on both Static as well as Dynamic layers. On the Static layer, DeepAMD achieves the highest accuracy of 93.4% for malware classification, 92.5% for malware category classification, and 90% for malware family classification. On the Dynamic layer, DeepAMD achieves the highest accuracy of 80.3% for malware category classification and 59% for malware family classification in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques.

The proposed epidemic prediction methods range from basic curve fitting methods and traffic interaction models to machine-learning approaches. If we combine all these approaches, we obtain the Network Inference based Prediction Algorithm (NIPA). In this paper, we analyse a diverse set of COVID-19 forecast algorithms, including several modifications of NIPA. Among the algorithms that we evaluated, the original NIPA performed best at forecasting the spread of COVID19 in Hubei, China and in the Netherlands. In particular, we show that network-based forecasting is superior to any other forecasting algorithm. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

However, the detection rate of adenomatous polyps can vary significantly among endoscopists. Here, we show that a machine-learning algorithm can detect polyps in clinical colonoscopies, in real time and with high sensitivity and specificity. We developed the deep-learning algorithm by using data from 1,290 patients, and validated it on newly collected 27,113 colonoscopy images from 1,138 patients with at least one detected polyp (per-image-sensitivity, 94.38%; per-image-specificity, 95.92%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.984), on a public database of 612 polyp-containing images (per-image-sensitivity, 88.24%), on 138 colonoscopy videos with histologically confirmed polyps (per-image-sensitivity of 91.64%; per-polyp-sensitivity, 100%), and on 54 unaltered full-range colonoscopy videos without polyps (per-image-specificity, 95.40%). By using a multi-threaded processing system, the algorithm can process at least 25 frames per second with a latency of 76.80 +/- 5.60 ms in real-time video analysis. The software may aid endoscopists while performing colonoscopies, and help assess differences in polyp and adenoma detection performance among endoscopists.

This paper presents an innovative approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the power generation of an economical wave energy converter named "Searaser". The data for analysis is provided by collecting the experimental data from another study and the exerted data from a numerical simulation of Searaser. The simulation is performed with Flow-3D software, which has high capability in analyzing fluid-solid interactions. The lack of relation between wind speed and output power in previous studies needs to be investigated in this field. Therefore, in this study, wind speed and output power are related with an LSTM method. Moreover, it can be inferred that the LSTM network is able to predict power in terms of height more accurately and faster than the numerical solution in a field of predicting. The network output figures show a great agreement, and the root mean square is 0.49 in the mean value related to the accuracy of the LSTM method. Furthermore, the mathematical relation between the generated power and wave height was introduced by curve fitting of the power function to the result of the LSTM method.

In this paper, considering the advantage of cone penetration test (CPT) over standard penetration test (SPT) and the suitability for dealing with the nonlinear problems of the extreme learning machine (ELM), the ELM was tried to train the prediction model. Firstly, seven prediction parameters were analyzed and determined; then 226 CPT samples were divided into the training set and test set; then the parameter of ELM model was assured by comparing the training accuracy and speed of model when setting the number of the neuron of the hidden layer from 5 to 16 and the activation function as sig, sin, hardlim. Finally, the performance of the established ELM model was tested through the test set. The results showed the accuracy of using function sin was 81.43% and 87.50% for the training set and test set, respectively; at the same time, the operation was 1.5055 s which was not much different from other two functions. The prediction model based on CPT perform better than that of SPT and can obtain a highly accurate prediction of 100% for the liquefied case and overall accuracy of 87.5%. ELM was proved to be feasible to be used and developed into the in situ evaluation.

Numerical Gaussian processes, by construction, are designed to deal with cases where (a) all we observe are noisy data on black-box initial conditions, and (b) we are interested in quantifying the uncertainty associated with such noisy data in our solutions to time dependent partial differential equations. Our method circumvents the need for spatial discretization of the differential operators by proper placement of Gaussian process priors. This is an attempt to construct structured and data-efficient learning machines, which are explicitly informed by the underlying physics that possibly generated the observed data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through several benchmark problems involving linear and nonlinear time dependent operators. In all examples, we are able to recover accurate approximations of the latent solutions, and consistently propagate uncertainty, even in cases involving very long time integration.

Nutrient status should thus be examined not by establishing the effects of single nutrient deficiencies on the physiological state of the plant but by combinations of them. Differences in the nutrient content significantly affect the photochemical process of photosynthesis therefore playing a crucial role in plants growth and development. In this work, an attempt was made to find a connection between element content in (i) different soils, (ii) plant leaves, grown on these soils and (iii) changes in selected chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, in order to find a method for early detection of plant stress resulting from the combination of nutrient status in natural conditions. To achieve this goal, a mathematical procedure was used which combines principal component analysis (a tool for the reduction of data complexity), hierarchical k-means (a classification method) and a machine-learning method-super-organising maps. Differences in the mineral content of soil and plant leaves resulted in functional changes in the photosynthetic machinery that can be measured by chlorophyll a fluorescent signals. Five groups of patterns in the chlorophyll fluorescent parameters were established: the 'no deficiency', Fe-specific deficiency, slight, moderate and strong deficiency. Unfavourable development in groups with nutrient deficiency of any kind was reflected by a strong increase in F (o) and Delta V/Delta t (0) and decline in phi (Po), phi (Eo) delta (Ro) and phi (Ro). The strong deficiency group showed the suboptimal development of the photosynthetic machinery, which affects both PSII and PSI. The nutrient-deficient groups also differed in antenna complex organisation. Thus, our work suggests that the chlorophyll fluorescent method combined with machine-learning methods can be highly informative and in some cases, it can replace much more expensive and time-consuming procedures such as chemometric analyses.

This unique ability explores the possibility of CPPs as therapeutic delivery and its potential applications in clinical therapy. Over the last few decades, a number of machine learning (ML)-based prediction tools have been developed, and some of them are freely available as web portals. However, the predictions produced by various tools are difficult to quantify and compare. In particular, there is no systematic comparison of the web-based prediction tools in performance, especially in practical applications. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review on the biological importance of CPPs, CPP database and existing ML-based methods for CPP prediction. To evaluate current prediction tools, we conducted a comparative study and analyzed a total of 12 models from 6 publicly available CPP prediction tools on 2 benchmark validation sets of CPPs and non-CPPs. Our benchmarking results demonstrated that a model from the KELM-CPPpred, namely KELM-hybrid-AAC, showed a significant improvement in overall performance, when compared to the other 11 prediction models. Moreover, through a length-dependency analysis, we find that existing prediction tools tend to more accurately predict CPPs and non-CPPs with the length of 20-25 residues long than peptides in other length ranges.

Predictive maintenance techniques have been adopted to extend the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of these drives, and minimize service shortage and data loss. Several approaches based on machine and deep learning techniques have been proposed to address these issues, mostly exploiting models based on Self-Monitoring analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) attributes. While these models have proven to be reliable, their performance is affected by the lack of information about the proximity of disk failure in time. Moreover, many of these techniques are sensitive to the highly unbalanced nature of existing data-sets, in terms of good to failed hard disk ratio. In this article, we propose a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)-based model combining SMART attributes and temporal analysis for estimating a hard drive health status according to its time to failure. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on two data-sets, one containing hourly samples from 23395 disks and the other reporting daily samples from 29878 disks. Experimental results showed that our approach is well suited to data-sets with different sampling periods, being able to predict hard drive health status up to 45 days before failure.

A hybrid stacking ensemble approach is proposed in this study for enhancing the prediction of slope stability. In the hybrid stacking ensemble approach, we used an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to find out the best combination of base classifiers (level 0) and determined a suitable meta-classifier (level 1) from a pool of 11 individual optimized machine learning (OML) algorithms. Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted in order to form the synthetic database for the training stage (150 cases) of the proposed model while 107 real field slope cases were used for the testing stage. The results by the hybrid stacking ensemble approach were then compared with that obtained by the 11 individual OML methods using confusion matrix, F1-score, and area under the curve, i.e. AUC-score. The comparisons showed that a significant improvement in the prediction ability of slope stability has been achieved by the hybrid stacking ensemble (AUC = 90.4%), which is 7% higher than the best of the 11 individual OML methods (AUC = 82.9%). Then, a further comparison was undertaken between the hybrid stacking ensemble method and basic ensemble classifier on slope stability prediction. The results showed a prominent performance of the hybrid stacking ensemble method over the basic ensemble method. Finally, the importance of the variables for slope stability was studied using linear vector quantization (LVQ) method. (C) 2021 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Tsubaki, M; Tomii, K; Sese, J				Tsubaki, Masashi; Tomii, Kentaro; Sese, Jun			Compound-protein interaction prediction with end-to-end learning of neural networks for graphs and sequences	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							DRUG-TARGET INTERACTIONS; CHEMOGENOMICS; KERNELS	Motivation: In bioinformatics, machine learning-based methods that predict the compound-protein interactions (CPIs) play an important role in the virtual screening for drug discovery. Recently, end-to-end representation learning for discrete symbolic data (e.g. words in natural language processing) using deep neural networks has demonstrated excellent performance on various difficult problems. For the CPI problem, data are provided as discrete symbolic data, i.e. compounds are represented as graphs where the vertices are atoms, the edges are chemical bonds, and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids. In this study, we investigate the use of end-to-end representation learning for compounds and proteins, integrate the representations, and develop a new CPI prediction approach by combining a graph neural network (GNN) for compounds and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for proteins. Results: Our experiments using three CPI datasets demonstrated that the proposed end-to-end approach achieves competitive or higher performance as compared to various existing CPI prediction methods. In addition, the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods on an unbalanced dataset. This suggests that data-driven representations of compounds and proteins obtained by end-to-end GNNs and CNNs are more robust than traditional chemical and biological features obtained from databases. Although analyzing deep learning models is difficult due to their black-box nature, we address this issue using a neural attention mechanism, which allows us to consider which subsequences in a protein are more important for a drug compound when predicting its interaction. The neural attention mechanism also provides effective visualization, which makes it easier to analyze a model even when modeling is performed using real-valued representations instead of discrete features.

However, continuous patient monitoring using wearable sensors generates a large amount of healthcare data. In addition, the user-generated healthcare data on social networking sites come in large volumes and are unstructured. The existing healthcare monitoring systems are not efficient at extracting valuable information from sensors and social networking data, and they have difficulty analyzing it effectively. On top of that, the traditional machine learning approaches are not enough to process healthcare big data for abnormality prediction. Therefore, a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on the cloud environment and a big data analytics engine is proposed to precisely store and analyze healthcare data, and to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed big data analytics engine is based on data mining techniques, ontologies, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients' health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Protege Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We present a method for molecular de novo design that utilizes generative recurrent neural networks (RNN) containing long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. This computational model captured the syntax of molecular representation in terms of SMILES strings with close to perfect accuracy. The learned pattern probabilities can be used for de novo SMILES generation. This molecular design concept eliminates the need for virtual compound library enumeration. By employing transfer learning, we fine-tuned the RNNs predictions for specific molecular targets. This approach enables virtual compound design without requiring secondary or external activity prediction, which could introduce error or unwanted bias.

This infection was first reported in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, and afterward, it became a global pandemic spreading rapidly around the world. As the virus spreads through human to human contact, it has affected our lives in a devastating way, including the vigorous pressure on the public health system, the world economy, education sector, workplaces, and shopping malls. Preventing viral spreading requires early detection of positive cases and to treat infected patients as quickly as possible. The need for COVID-19 testing kits has increased, and many of the developing countries in the world are facing a shortage of testing kits as new cases are increasing day by day. In this situation, the recent research using radiology imaging (such as X-ray and CT scan) techniques can be proven helpful to detect COVID-19 as X-ray and CT scan images provide important information about the disease caused by COVID-19 virus. The latest data mining and machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be applied along with X-ray and CT scan images of the lungs for the accurate and rapid detection of the disease, assisting in mitigating the problem of scarcity of testing kits. Methods: Hence a novel CNN model called CoroDet for automatic detection of COVID-19 by using raw chest X-ray and CT scan images have been proposed in this study. CoroDet is developed to serve as an accurate diagnostics for 2 class classification (COVID and Normal), 3 class classification (COVID, Normal, and non-COVID pneumonia), and 4 class classification (COVID, Normal, non-COVID viral pneumonia, and non-COVID bacterial pneumonia). Results: The performance of our proposed model was compared with ten existing techniques for COVID detection in terms of accuracy. A classification accuracy of 99.1% for 2 class classification, 94.2% for 3 class classification, and 91.2% for 4 class classification was produced by our proposed model, which is obviously better than the state-of-the-art-methods used for COVID-19 detection to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the dataset with x-ray images that we prepared for the evaluation of our method is the largest datasets for COVID detection as far as our knowledge goes. Conclusion: The experimental results of our proposed method CoroDet indicate the superiority of CoroDet over the existing state-of-the-art-methods. CoroDet may assist clinicians in making appropriate decisions for COVID-19 detection and may also mitigate the problem of scarcity of testing kits. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed method called, HyperFace, fuses the intermediate layers of a deep CNN using a separate CNN followed by a multi-task learning algorithm that operates on the fused features. It exploits the synergy among the tasks which boosts up their individual performances. Additionally, we propose two variants of HyperFace: (1) HyperFace-ResNet that builds on the ResNet-101 model and achieves significant improvement in performance, and (2) Fast-HyperFace that uses a high recall fast face detector for generating region proposals to improve the speed of the algorithm. Extensive experiments show that the proposed models are able to capture both global and local information in faces and performs significantly better than many competitive algorithms for each of these four tasks.

It leverages the Internet of Things and machine learning to learn individuals' comfort requirements directly from the data collected in their everyday environment. Its results could be aggregated to predict comfort of a population. To provide guidance on future efforts in this emerging research area, this paper presents a unified framework for personal comfort models. We first define the problem by providing a brief discussion of existing thermal comfort models and their limitations for real-world applications, and then review the current state of research on personal comfort models including a summary of key advances and gaps. We then describe a modeling framework to establish fundamental concepts and methodologies for developing and evaluating personal comfort models, followed by a discussion of how such models can be integrated into indoor environmental controls. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for applications of personal comfort models for building design, control, standards, and future research.

Ordered quantile normalization: a semiparametric transformation built for the cross-validation era	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						High-dimensional data analysis; preprocessing; predictive modeling; machine learning; normalizing transformation	NORMALITY; FAMILY	Normalization transformations have recently experienced a resurgence in popularity in the era of machine learning, particularly in data preprocessing. However, the classical methods that can be adapted to cross-validation are not always effective. We introduce Ordered Quantile (ORQ) normalization, a one-to-one transformation that is designed to consistently and effectively transform a vector of arbitrary distribution into a vector that follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the absence of ties, ORQ normalization is guaranteed to produce normally distributed transformed data. Once trained, an ORQ transformation can be readily and effectively applied to new data. We compare the effectiveness of the ORQ technique with other popular normalization methods in a simulation study where the true data generating distributions are known. We find that ORQ normalization is the only method that works consistently and effectively, regardless of the underlying distribution. We also explore the use of repeated cross-validation to identify the best normalizing transformation when the true underlying distribution is unknown.

Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors-including mean climate as well as climate extremes-explain 20%-49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%-43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes.

Predicting electricity consumption for commercial and residential buildings using deep recurrent neural networks	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Building energy modeling; Machine learning; Recurrent neural networks; Deep learning; Electric load prediction	OF-THE-ART; MODELS	This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of >= 1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to longterm prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building's schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building's load profiles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi layered perceptron model.

Recently, with the rise of deep learning (DL), modern abstract features from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have hugely improved SAR ship classification accuracy. However, most existing CNN-based SAR ship classifiers overly rely on abstract features, but uncritically abandon traditional mature hand-crafted features, which may incur some challenges for further improving accuracy. Hence, this article proposes a novel DL network with histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature fusion (HOG-ShipCLSNet) for preferable SAR ship classification. In HOG-ShipCLSNet, four mechanisms are proposed to ensure superior classification accuracy, that is, 1) a multiscale classification mechanism (MS-CLS-Mechanism); 2) a global self-attention mechanism (GS-ATT-Mechanism); 3) a fully connected balance mechanism (FC-BAL-Mechanism); and 4) an HOG feature fusion mechanism (HOG-FF-Mechanism). We perform sufficient ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of these four mechanisms. Finally, our experimental results on two open SAR ship datasets (OpenSARShip and FUSAR-Ship) jointly reveal that HOG-ShipCLSNet dramatically outperforms both modern CNN-based methods and traditional hand-crafted feature methods.

Mounting evidence has established the links between cancer stemness and intratumoral heterogeneity across cancer. Currently, the intertumoral heterogeneity of cancer stemness remains elusive in CRC. MethodsThis study enrolled four CRC datasets, two immunotherapy datasets, and a clinical in-house cohort. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was performed to decipher the heterogeneity of cancer stemness. Multiple machine learning algorithms were applied to develop a nine-gene stemness cluster predictor. The clinical outcomes, multi-omics landscape, potential mechanisms, and immune features of the stemness clusters were further explored. ResultsBased on 26 published stemness signatures derived by alternative approaches, we decipher two heterogeneous clusters, low stemness cluster 1 (C1) and high stemness cluster 2 (C2). C2 possessed a higher proportion of advanced tumors and displayed worse overall survival and relapse-free survival compared with C1. The MSI-H and CMS1 tumors tended to enrich in C1, and the mesenchymal subtype CMS4 was the prevalent subtype of C2. Subsequently, we developed a nine-gene stemness cluster predictor, which robustly validated and reproduced our stemness clusters in three independent datasets and an in-house cohort. C1 also displayed a generally superior mutational burden, and C2 possessed a higher burden of copy number deletion. Further investigations suggested that C1 enriched numerous proliferation-related biological processes and abundant immune infiltration, while C2 was significantly associated with mesenchyme development and differentiation. Given results derived from three algorithms and two immunotherapeutic cohorts, we observed C1 could benefit more from immunotherapy. For patients with C2, we constructed a ridge regression model and further identified nine latent therapeutic agents, which might improve their clinical outcomes. ConclusionsThis study proposed two stemness clusters with stratified prognosis, multi-omics landscape, potential mechanisms, and treatment options. Current work not only provided new insights into the heterogeneity of cancer stemness, but also shed light on optimizing decision-making in immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

As an emerging field in industrial applications and an effective solution for fault recognition, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been receiving increasing attention from academia and industry. However, great challenges are met by the AI methods under the different real operating conditions. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review of AI algorithms in rotating machinery fault diagnosis, from both the views of theory background and industrial applications. A brief introduction of different AI algorithms is presented first, including the following methods: k-nearest neighbour, naive Bayes, support vector machine, artificial neural network and deep learning. Then, a broad literature survey of these AI algorithms in industrial applications is given. Finally, the advantages, limitations, practical implications of different AI algorithms, as well as some new research trends, are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated the impacts of bacterial phylogenetic diversity on the functional traits and the stability of the soil microbiome. Communities differing in phylogenetic diversity were generated by inoculating serially diluted soil suspensions into sterilized soil, and the stability of the microbiome was assessed by detecting community variations under various pH levels. The taxonomic features and potential functional traits were detected by DNA sequencing.ResultsWe found that bacterial communities with higher phylogenetic diversity tended to be more stable, implying that microbiomes with higher biodiversity are more resistant to perturbation. Functional gene co-occurrence network and machine learning classification analyses identified specialized metabolic functions, especially "nitrogen metabolism" and "phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism," as keystone functions. Further taxonomic annotation found that keystone functions are carried out by specific bacterial taxa, including Nitrospira and Gemmatimonas, among others.ConclusionsThis study provides new insights into our understanding of the relationships between soil microbiome biodiversity and ecosystem stability and highlights specialized metabolic functions embedded in keystone taxa that may be essential for soil microbiome stability.

Meanwhile, the deregulation of the power industry, particularly on the delivery side, has continuously been moving forward worldwide. How to employ massive smart meter data to promote and enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the power grid is a pressing issue. To date, substantial works have been conducted on smart meter data analytics. To provide a comprehensive overview of the current research and to identify challenges for future research, this paper conducts an application-oriented review of smart meter data analytics. Following the three stages of analytics, namely, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, we identify the key application areas as load analysis, load forecasting, and load management. We also review the techniques and methodologies adopted or developed to address each application. In addition, we also discuss some research trends, such as big data issues, novel machine learning technologies, new business models, the transition of energy systems, and data privacy and security.

J	Punmiya, R; Choe, S				Punmiya, Rajiv; Choe, Sangho			Energy Theft Detection Using Gradient Boosting Theft Detector With Feature Engineering-Based Preprocessing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Energy theft detection; machine learning; gradient boosting; XGBoost; CatBoost; LightGBM; SVM; feature engineering		For the smart grid energy theft identification, this letter introduces a gradient boosting theft detector (GBTD) based on the three latest gradient boosting classifiers (GBCs): 1) extreme gradient boosting; 2) categorical boosting; and 3) light gradient boosting method. While most of existing machine learning (ML) algorithms just focus on fine tuning the hyper-parameters of the classifiers, our ML algorithm, GBTD, focuses on the feature engineering-based preprocessing to improve detection performance as well as time-complexity. GBTD improves both detection rate and false positive rate (FPR) of those GBCs by generating stochastic features like standard deviation, mean, minimum, and maximum value of daily electricity usage. GBTD also reduces the classifier complexity with weighted feature-importance-based extraction techniques. Emphasis has been laid upon the practical application of the proposed ML for theft detection by minimizing FPR and reducing data storage space and improving time-complexity of the GBTD classifiers. Additionally, this letter proposes an updated version of the existing six theft cases to mimic real-world theft patterns and applies them to the dataset for numerical evaluation of the proposed algorithm.

A review of classification algorithms for EEG-based brain-computer interfaces: a 10 year update	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; classification; spatial filtering; deep learning; Riemannian geometry; transfer learning	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; ADAPTIVE CLASSIFICATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; UNSUPERVISED ADAPTATION; COVARIANCE MATRICES; MUTUAL INFORMATION; ERROR POTENTIALS; BCI	Objective. Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.

The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation is recommended to estimate ETo a given its good accuracy. However, the estimation of ETo poses a challenge when the availability of meteorological data is limited since the FAO-56 PM equation requires data on temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed. This study evaluates, for the first time, the performance of alternative equations, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), for the estimation of daily ETo across the entirety of Brazil using measured data on temperature and relative humidity or only temperature. Two strategies, not yet used in Brazil, were used to develop the ANN and SVM models: (i) the definition of groups of weather stations with similar climatic characteristics, using the K-means clustering algorithm, to develop models specific for each group; and (ii) the addition of previous meteorological data as input for the models. Data from 203 weather stations distributed across Brazil were used. The ANN and SVM models showed higher performances than the equations that were studied, even when they were calibrated. The evaluated strategies (clustering and previous days) provided considerable performance gains. For the temperature-based models, the best performance was obtained by the ANN developed with the strategy of clustering and the use of data from two previous days as input; however, due to the similar performance and greater generalization capacity, the ANN developed without clustering and with the use of data from four previous days is recommended. For the temperature- and relative humidity-based models, the ANN developed with data from four previous days was the best option.

As a promising solution, domain adaptation has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The aim of this paper is to survey the recent advances of domain adaptation methods in medical image analysis. We first present the motivation of introducing domain adaptation techniques to tackle domain heterogeneity issues for medical image analysis. Then we provide a review of recent domain adaptation models in various medical image analysis tasks. We categorize the existing methods into shallow and deep models, and each of them is further divided into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. We also provide a brief summary of the benchmark medical image datasets that support current domain adaptation research. This survey will enable researchers to gain a better understanding of the current status, challenges and future directions of this energetic research field.

J	Zawacki-Richter, O; Marin, VI; Bond, M; Gouverneur, F				Zawacki-Richter, Olaf; Marin, Victoria I.; Bond, Melissa; Gouverneur, Franziska			Systematic review of research on artificial intelligence applications in higher education - where are the educators?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; Higher education; Machine learning; Intelligent tutoring systems; Systematic review	LEARNING ANALYTICS; TUTORING SYSTEMS; ACADEMIC-SUCCESS; STUDENTS; MACHINE; SUPPORT; PERFORMANCE; DECISION; ONLINE; TEACHERS	According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education.

Likewise, the differences among vibration signals under different health states can be small under some operating conditions. Traditional deep learning methods apply fixed nonlinear transformations to all the input signals, which have a negative impact on the discriminative feature learning ability, i.e., projecting the intraclass signals into the same region and the interclass signals into distant regions. Aiming at this issue, this article develops a new activation function, i.e., adaptively parametric rectifier linear units, and inserts the activation function into deep residual networks to improve the feature learning ability, so that each input signal is trained to have its own set of nonlinear transformations. To be specific, a subnetwork is inserted as an embedded module to learn slopes to be used in the nonlinear transformation. The slopes are dependent on the input signal, and thereby the developed method has more flexible nonlinear transformations than the traditional deep learning methods. Finally, the improved performance of the developed method in learning discriminative features has been validated through fault diagnosis applications.

Starting as a pure head scanner, modern CT systems are now able to perform whole-body examinations within a couple of seconds in isotropic resolution, single-rotation whole-organ perfusion, and temporal resolution to fulfill the needs of cardiac CT. Because of the increasing number of CT examinations in all age groups and overall medical-driven radiation exposure, dose reduction remains a hot topic. Although fast gantry rotation, broad detector arrays, and different dual-energy solutions were main topics in the past years, new techniques such as photon counting detectors, powerful x-ray tubes for low-kV scanning, automated image preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms have moved into focus today. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the technical specifications of up-to-date available CT systems and recent hardware and software innovations for CT systems in the near future.

AlgPred 2.0: an improved method for predicting allergenic proteins and mapping of IgE epitopes	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						allergens; IgE epitope; prediction; machine learning; MEME; MAST; MERCI; BLAST	RNA-BINDING PROTEINS; FOOD ALLERGY; INSECT ALLERGY; VACCINE	AlgPred 2.0 is a web server developed for predicting allergenic proteins and allergenic regions in a protein. It is an updated version of AlgPred developed in 2006. The dataset used for training, testing and validation consists of 10 075 allergens and 10 075 non-allergens. In addition, 10 451 experimentally validated immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes were used to identify antigenic regions in a protein. All models were trained on 80% of data called training dataset, and the performance of models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation technique. The performance of the final model trained on the training dataset was evaluated on 20% of data called validation dataset; no two proteins in any two sets have more than 40% similarity. First, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search has been performed against the dataset, and allergens were predicted based on the level of similarity with known allergens. Second, IgE epitopes obtained from the IEDB database were searched in the dataset to predict allergens based on their presence in a protein. Third, motif-based approaches like multiple EM for motif elicitation/motif alignment and search tool have been used to predict allergens. Fourth, allergen prediction models have been developed using a wide range of machine learning techniques. Finally, the ensemble approach has been used for predicting allergenic protein by combining prediction scores of different approaches. Our best model achieved maximum performance in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.98 with Matthew's correlation coefficient 0.85 on the validation dataset.

The high concentration of fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is known to be associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can help governments warn people at high risk, thus mitigating the complications. Although attempts have been made to predict PM2.5 concentrations, the factors influencing PM2.5 prediction have not been investigated. In this work, we study feature importance for PM2.5 prediction in Tehran's urban area, implementing random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning machine learning (ML) approaches. We use 23 features, including satellite and meteorological data, ground-measured PM2.5, and geographical data, in the modeling. The best model performance obtained was R-2 = 0.81 (R = 0.9), MAE = 9.93 mu g/m(3), and RMSE = 13.58 mu g/m(3) using the XGBoost approach, incorporating elimination of unimportant features. However, all three ML methods performed similarly and R-2 varied from 0.63 to 0.67, when Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution was included, and 0.77 to 0.81, when AOD at 3 km resolution was excluded. Contrary to the PM2.5 lag data, satellite-derived AODs did not improve model performance.

This paper reviews the key capabilities of AI to help surgeons understand and critically evaluate new AI applications and to contribute to new developments. Summary Background Data: AI is composed of various subfields that each provide potential solutions to clinical problems. Each of the core subfields of AI reviewed in this piece has also been used in other industries such as the autonomous car, social networks, and deep learning computers. Methods: A review of AI papers across computer science, statistics, and medical sources was conducted to identify key concepts and techniques within AI that are driving innovation across industries, including surgery. Limitations and challenges of working with AI were also reviewed. Results: Four main subfields of AI were defined: (1) machine learning, (2) artificial neural networks, (3) natural language processing, and (4) computer vision. Their current and future applications to surgical practice were introduced, including big data analytics and clinical decision support systems. The implications of AI for surgeons and the role of surgeons in advancing the technology to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions: Surgeons are well positioned to help integrate AI into modern practice. Surgeons should partner with data scientists to capture data across phases of care and to provide clinical context, for AI has the potential to revolutionize the way surgery is taught and practiced with the promise of a future optimized for the highest quality patient care.

Sri Madhava			Deep-learning framework to detect lung abnormality - A study with chest X-Ray and lung CT scan images	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article							NODULES; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION	Lung abnormalities are highly risky conditions in humans. The early diagnosis of lung abnormalities is essential to reduce the risk by enabling quick and efficient treatment. This research work aims to propose a Deep-Learning (DL) framework to examine lung pneumonia and cancer. This work proposes two different DL techniques to assess the considered problem: (i) The initial DL method, named a modified AlexNet (MAN), is proposed to classify chest X-Ray images into normal and pneumonia class. In the MAN, the classification is implemented using with Support Vector Machine (SVM), and its performance is compared against Softmax. Further, its performance is validated with other pre-trained DL techniques, such as AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50. (ii) The second DL work implements a fusion of handcrafted and learned features in the MAN to improve classification accuracy during lung cancer assessment. This work employs serial fusion and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based features selection to enhance the feature vector. The performance of this DL frame work is tested using benchmark lung cancer CT images of LIDC-IDRI and classification accuracy (97.27%) is attained. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We propose a dynamic decision support system (DSS) for sustainable supplier selection in circular supply chains. Unlike the linear take-make-waste-dispose production systems, circular supply chains are nonlinear make-waste-recycle production systems with zero-waste vision. The proposed DSS allows users to customize and weight their economic, social, and circular criteria with a fuzzy best-worst method (BWM) and select the most suitable supplier with the fuzzy inference system (FIS). Machine learning is used to maintain and synthesize the criteria scores for the suppliers after each supplier selection engagement. We present a case study at a petrochemical holding company with a controlling interest over several subsidiary companies to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

Emerging opportunities and challenges for passive acoustics in ecological assessment and monitoring	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Review						acoustic indices; bioacoustics; biodiversity monitoring; deep learning; ecoacoustics; ecological monitoring; machine learning; passive acoustic monitoring	IMPERFECT DETECTION; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; BIODIVERSITY; INDEXES; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; IMPACT; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNITIES	High-throughput environmental sensing technologies are increasingly central to global monitoring of the ecological impacts of human activities. In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.

Active learning across intermetallics to guide discovery of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction and H-2 evolution	NATURE CATALYSIS			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION	The electrochemical reduction of CO2 and H-2 evolution from water can be used to store renewable energy that is produced intermittently. Scale-up of these reactions requires the discovery of effective electrocatalysts, but the electrocatalyst search space is too large to explore exhaustively. Here we present a theoretical, fully automated screening method that uses a combination of machine learning and optimization to guide density functional theory calculations, which are then used to predict electrocatalyst performance. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method by screening various alloys of 31 different elements, and thereby perform a screening that encompasses 50% of the d-block elements and 33% of the p-block elements. This method has thus far identified 131 candidate surfaces across 54 alloys for CO2 reduction and 258 surfaces across 102 alloys for H-2 evolution. We use qualitative analyses to prioritize the top candidates for experimental validation.

Since its introduction, researchers have been working on enabling this innovative technology in managing the radio spectrum. As a result, this research field has been progressing at a rapid pace and significant advances have been made. To help researchers stay abreast of these advances, surveys and tutorial papers are strongly needed. Therefore, in this paper, we aimed to provide an in-depth survey on the most recent advances in spectrum sensing, covering its development from its inception to its current state and beyond. In addition, we highlight the efficiency and limitations of both narrowband and wideband spectrum sensing techniques as well as the challenges involved in their implementation. TV white spaces are also discussed in this paper as the first real application of cognitive radio. Last but by no means least, we discuss future research directions. This survey paper was designed in a way to help new researchers in the field to become familiar with the concepts of spectrum sensing, compressive sensing, and machine learning, all of which are the enabling technologies of the future networks, yet to help researchers further improve the efficiently of spectrum sensing.

The accurate prediction of protein methylation sites is fundamentally important for revealing the molecular mechanisms undergoing methylation. In recent years, computational prediction based on machine learning algorithms has emerged as a powerful and robust approach for identifying methylation sites, and much progress has been made in predictive performance improvement. However, the predictive performance of existing methods is not satisfactory in terms of overall accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose a novel random-forest-based predictor called MePred-RF, integrating several discriminative sequence-based feature descriptors and improving feature representation capability using a powerful feature selection technique. Importantly, unlike other methods based on multiple, complex information inputs, our proposed MePred-RF is based on sequence information alone. Comparative studies on benchmark datasets via vigorous jackknife tests indicate that our proposed MePred-RF method remarkably outperforms other state-of-the-art predictors, leading by a 4.5 percent average in terms of overall accuracy. A user-friendly webserver that implements the proposed method has been established for researchers' convenience, and is now freely available for public use through http://server.malab.cn/MePred-RF. We anticipate our research tool to be useful for the large-scale prediction and analysis of protein methylation sites.

It can assist in evaluating building energy efficiency, in carrying out building commissioning, and in identifying and diagnosing building system faults. This review takes an in-depth look at energy demand prediction models for buildings in that it delves into recent developments in building energy approaches used to predict energy usage. By enlisting current approaches to the modelling of buildings, methods for building energy simulations can be categorized into four level classes as follows: (i) data driven approaches; (ii) physics-based approaches; (iii) large scale building energy forecasting approaches; and (iv) hybrid approaches. The focus of this review is to target the data-driven approach and large-scale building energy predicting-based approaches. Here the data driven approaches can be categorized by (1) artificial neural network based approaches; (2) clustering based approaches; (3) statistical and machine learning-based approaches; and (4) support vector machine based approaches. From there, the type of data-driven based approach is further grouped by (a) benchmarking models; (b) energy-mapping models; (c) energy forecasting models; and (d) energy profiling models. Large-scale building-energy prediction techniques is then categorized as follows: (1) white-box based approaches; (2) black-box based approaches, and (3) grey-box based approaches. The current study explores first-rate data-driven based approaches about building energy analysis for industrial, commercial, domestic, etc., within a rural and urban setting. This review paper is based on the necessity of identifying points of departure and research opportunities for urban and rural-level analyses of building level energy performance. A variety of issues are explored which include: energy performance metrics; end-use of different building types; multiple levels of granularity; and urban and rural scales. Each technique encompasses a variety of input information as well as varying calculations or simulation models along with furnishing contrasting outcomes that suggest a variety of usages. A thorough review of each technique is presented in this study. This review highlights strengths, shortcomings, and purpose of the methods of numerous data-mining based approaches. A comprehensive review of energy forecasting models that are specified in the literature part is also provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A classifier of support vector machine (SVM) was employed as a base classifier, and four Meta/ensemble classifiers, including Adaboost (AB), bagging (BA), rotation forest (RF), and random subspace (RS), were used to construct new ensemble models. SVM has been used previously to spatially predict landslides, but not together with its ensembles. We selected 20 conditioning factors and randomly portioned 98 landslide locations into training (70%) and validating (30%) groups. Several statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC), were used for model comparison and validation. Using the One-R Attribute Evaluation (ORAE) technique, we found that all 20 conditioning factors were significant in identifying landslide locations, but "distance to road" was found to be the most important. The RS (AUC = 0.837) and RF (AUC = 0.834) significantly improved the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy of the SVM (AUC = 0.810), whereas the BA (AUC = 0.807) and AB (AUC = 0.779) did not. The random subspace based support vector machine (RSSVM) model is a promising technique for helping to better manage land in landslide-prone areas.

However, a less known but powerful result is that a NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. Here, we thus extend this theorem to DNNs. We design a new network with small generalization error, the deep operator network (DeepONet), which consists of a DNN for encoding the discrete input function space (branch net) and another DNN for encoding the domain of the output functions (trunk net). We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations. We study different formulations of the input function space and its effect on the generalization error for 16 different diverse applications.

They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE). In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.

SNP discovery and structural insights into OeFAD2 unravelling high oleic/linoleic ratio in olive oil	COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Fatty acid desaturase; Machine learning; Haplotype; Protein structure; Docking; Oleic/linoleic acid ratio	CLUSTAL-W; GENE; CLASSIFICATION; DNA	Fatty Acid Desaturase 2 (FAD2), a key enzyme in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, is involved in the desaturation and conversion of oleic acid to linoleic acid. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in oleic/linoleic acid ratio and the quality of olive oil. DNA sequencing of 19 FAD2 genes from a set of olive oil varieties revealed several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and highlighted associations between some of the SNPs and saturated fatty acids contents. This was further confirmed by SNP-interaction and machine learning approach. Haplotype diversity analysis led to the discovery of three highly polymorphic SNPs and four haplotypes harboring differential oleic/linoleic acid ratios. Moreover, a combination of molecular modeling and docking experiments allowed a deeper and better understanding of the structure-function relationship of the FAD2 enzyme. Sequence patterns and variations involved in the regulation of the FAD2 activity were also identified. Furthermore, S82C and H213N substitutions in OeFAD2 make the Oueslati variety more interesting in terms of fatty acid profile and oleic acid level. (C) 2022 The Authors.

We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 linked to COVID-19-related deaths. Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology. In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM2.5 and PM10 connected to COVID-19: 17.4 mu g/m(3) (PM2.5) and 29.6 mu g/m(3) (PM10) for Paris; 15.6 mu g/m(3) (PM2.5) and 20.6 mu g/m(3) (PM10) for Lyon; 14.3 mu g/m(3) (PM2.5) and 22.04 mu g/m(3) (PM10) for Marseille. Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament. Finally, a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm is applied to check the consistency of our findings.

Examining non-linear effects of streetscape greenery on walking propensity of older adults	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Streetscape greenery; Big data; Machine learning; Random forest; Travel behavior; Walking behavior; Population aging	BOOSTING DECISION TREES; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; AGE-DIFFERENCES; ACTIVE TRAVEL; HONG-KONG; NEIGHBORHOOD; SENIORS; ACCESSIBILITY	Population aging is a conspicuous demographic trend shaping the world profoundly. Walking is a critical travel mode and physical activity for older adults. As such, there is a need to determine the factors influencing the walking behavior of older people in the era of population aging. Streetscape greenery is an easily perceived builtenvironment attribute and can promote walking behavior, but it has received insufficient attention. More importantly, the non-linear effects of streetscape greenery on the walking behavior of older adults have not been examined. We therefore use readily available Google Street View imagery and a fully convolutional neural network to evaluate human-scale, eye-level streetscape greenery. Using data from the Hong Kong Travel Characteristic Survey, we adopt a machine learning technique, namely random forest modeling, to scrutinize the nonlinear effects of streetscape greenery on the walking propensity of older adults. The results show that streetscape greenery has a positive effect on walking propensity within a certain range, but outside the range, the positive association no longer holds. The non-linear associations of other built-environment attributes are also examined.

However, at the same time, it is unclear which types of job roles and skills constitute this area. To this end, this study pursues to drive clarity across the heterogeneous nature of skills required in Big Data professions, by analyzing a large amount of real-world job posts published online. More precisely we: 1) identify four Big Data 'job families'; 2) recognize nine homogeneous groups of Big Data skills (skill sets) that are being demanded by companies; 3) characterize each job family with the appropriate level of competence required within each Big Data skill set. We propose a novel, semi-automated, fully replicable, analytical methodology based on a combination of machine learning algorithms and expert judgement. Our analysis leverages a significant amount of online job posts, obtained through web scraping, to generate an intelligible classification of job roles and skill sets. The results can support business leaders and HR managers in establishing clear strategies for the acquisition and the development of the right skills needed to leverage Big Data at best. Moreover, the structured classification of job families and skill sets will help establish a common dictionary to be used by HR recruiters and education providers, so that supply and demand can more effectively meet in the job marketplace.

This scenario has hardly been studied in industrial research. But it is a common problem that massive fault samples are not available for the target faults, which limits the successes of conventional data-driven approaches in practical application. Here, we introduce the idea of zero-shot learning into the industry field, and tackle the zero-sample fault diagnosis task by proposing the fault description based attribute transfer method. Specifically, the method learns to determine the fault categories using the human-defined fault descriptions instead of the collected fault samples.The defined description consists of arbitrary attributes of the faults, including the fault positions, the consequences of the fault, and even the cause of the fault, etc. For the attribute knowledge of target faults, they can be prelearned and transferred from some readily available faults occurred in the same process. Afterwards, the target faults can be diagnosed based on the defined fault descriptions without the need for any additional data based training. Besides, the supervised principle component analysis is adopted in our method to extract the attribute related features to offer an effective attribute learning. We analyze and interpret the feasibility of the fault description based method theoretically. Also, the zero-sample fault diagnosis experiments are designed and conducted on the benchmark Tennessee-Eastman process and the real thermal power plant process to validate the effectiveness. The results show that it is indeed possible to diagnose target faults without their samples.

To this end, a methodology combining qualitative analysis employing support vector machine-based acoustic emission (AE) monitoring and quantitative analysis using AE rate process theory was proposed. In this work, firstly, the propagation attenuation characteristics of the AE amplitude and frequency were studied using pencil-lead break tests. The hybrid PSO-SVM model was employed to automatically identify the damage stages of the AE signals based on the field in-situ axial compression test data. Then, laboratory compression and shear tests on small-scale specimens were performed with AE monitoring. The Boltzmann sigmoidal modified function between relative stress and AE hits was established. Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis, a damage index-based early warning range was proposed, which can help to decide the damage level of masonry structures. The results of this paper can provide some new insight for the analysis of masonry damage.

However, to decode the original sample image from its hologram(s), autofocusing and phase recovery are needed, which are in general cumbersome and time-consuming to perform digitally. Here we demonstrate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that simultaneously performs autofocusing and phase recovery to significantly extend the depth of field (DOF) and the reconstruction speed in holographic imaging. For this, a CNN is trained by using pairs of randomly defocused back-propagated holograms and their corresponding in-focus phase-recovered images. After this training phase, the CNN takes a single back-propagated hologram of a 3D sample as input to rapidly achieve phase recovery and reconstruct an in-focus image of the sample over a significantly extended DOF. This deep-learning-based DOF extension method is non-iterative and significantly improves the algorithm time complexity of holographic image reconstruction from O(nm) to O(1), where n refers to the number of individual object points or particles within the sample volume, and m represents the focusing search space within which each object point or particle needs to be individually focused. These results highlight some of the unique opportunities created by data-enabled statistical image reconstruction methods powered by machine learning, and we believe that the presented approach can be broadly applicable to computationally extend the DOF of other imaging modalities.

The proposed method contains two main steps. First, the endmembers are extracted using a geometric endmember extraction method, i.e., a simplex volume maximization in the subspace of the data set. Then, the abundances are estimated using a deep image prior. The main motivation of this work is to boost the abundance estimation and make the unmixing problem robust to noise. The proposed deep image prior uses a convolutional neural network to estimate the fractional abundances, relying on the extracted endmembers and the observed hyperspectral data set. The proposed method is evaluated on simulated and three real remote sensing data for a range of SNR values (i.e., from 20 to 50 dB). The results show considerable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds-urging the quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are related to and may therefore act as noninvasive radiomic biomarkers for immunotherapy response. Patients and methods In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We carried out an AI-based characterization of each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and validate a noninvasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing between immunotherapy responding and nonresponding. To define the biological basis of the radiographic biomarker, we carried out gene set enrichment analysis in an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients. Results The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to 0.83 AUC, P<0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64 AUC, P=0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level, immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both cancer types (P<0.001), resulting in a 1-year survival difference of 24% (P=0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and preferential response to immunotherapy. Conclusions These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions on standard-of-care imaging may function as noninvasive biomarkers for response to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.

J	He, R; Wu, X; Sun, ZN; Tan, TN				He, Ran; Wu, Xiang; Sun, Zhenan; Tan, Tieniu			Wasserstein CNN: Learning Invariant Features for NIR-VIS Face Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Heterogeneous face recognition; VIS-NIR face matching; feature representation	SPECTRAL REGRESSION; COUPLED DICTIONARY	Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) aims at matching facial images acquired from different sensing modalities with mission-critical applications in forensics, security and commercial sectors. However, HFR presents more challenging issues than traditional face recognition because of the large intra-class variation among heterogeneous face images and the limited availability of training samples of cross-modality face image pairs. This paper proposes the novel Wasserstein convolutional neural network (WCNN) approach for learning invariant features between near-infrared (NIR) and visual (VIS) face images (i.e., NIR-VIS face recognition). The low-level layers of the WCNN are trained with widely available face images in the VIS spectrum, and the high-level layer is divided into three parts: the NIR layer, the VIS layer and the NIR-VIS shared layer. The first two layers aim at learning modality-specific features, and the NIR-VIS shared layer is designed to learn a modality-invariant feature subspace. The Wasserstein distance is introduced into the NIR-VIS shared layer to measure the dissimilarity between heterogeneous feature distributions. W-CNN leaming is performed to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the NIR distribution and the VIS distribution for invariant deep feature representations of heterogeneous face images. To avoid the over-fitting problem on small-scale heterogeneous face data, a correlation prior is introduced on the fully-connected WCNN layers to reduce the size of the parameter space. This prior is implemented by a low-rank constraint in an end-to-end network. The joint formulation leads to an alternating minimization for deep feature representation at the training stage and an efficient computation for heterogeneous data at the testing stage. Extensive experiments using three challenging NIR-VIS face recognition databases demonstrate the superiority of the WCNN method over state-of-the-art methods.

Most of the existing gait recognition methods take silhouettes or articulated body models as gait features. These methods suffer from degraded recognition performance when handling confounding variables, such as clothing, carrying and viewing angle. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel AutoEncoder framework, GaitNet, to explicitly disentangle appearance, canonical and pose features from RGB imagery. The LSTM integrates pose features over time as a dynamic gait feature while canonical features are averaged as a static gait feature. Both of them are utilized as classification features. In addition, we collect a Frontal-View Gait (FVG) dataset to focus on gait recognition from frontal-view walking, which is a challenging problem since it contains minimal gait cues compared to other views. FVG also includes other important variations, e.g., walking speed, carrying, and clothing. With extensive experiments on CASIA-B, USF, and FVG datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance to the SOTA quantitatively, the ability of feature disentanglement qualitatively, and promising computational efficiency. We further compare our GaitNet with state-of-the-art face recognition to demonstrate the advantages of gait biometrics identification under certain scenarios, e.g., long-distance/lower resolutions, cross viewing angles.

J	Plawiak, P; Acharya, UR				Plawiak, Pawel; Acharya, U. Rajendra			Novel deep genetic ensemble of classifiers for arrhythmia detection using ECG signals	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ECG; Biomedical signal processing and analysis; Machine learning; Genetic algorithms; Ensemble learning; Deep learning	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; HEARTBEAT CLASSIFICATION; AUTOMATED DETECTION; RECOGNITION; MODEL	The heart disease is one of the most serious health problems in today's world. Over 50 million persons have cardiovascular diseases around the world. Our proposed work based on 744 segments of ECG signal is obtained from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database (strongly imbalanced data) for one lead (modified lead II), from 29 people. In this work, we have used long-duration (10 s) ECG signal segments (13 times less classifications/analysis). The spectral power density was estimated based on Welch's method and discrete Fourier transform to strengthen the characteristic ECG signal features. Our main contribution is the design of a novel three-layer (48 + 4 + 1) deep genetic ensemble of classifiers (DGEC). Developed method is a hybrid which combines the advantages of: (1) ensemble learning, (2) deep learning, and (3) evolutionary computation. Novel system was developed by the fusion of three normalization types, four Hamming window widths, four classifiers types, stratified tenfold cross-validation, genetic feature (frequency components) selection, layered learning, genetic optimization of classifiers parameters, and new genetic layered training (expert votes selection) to connect classifiers. The developed DGEC system achieved a recognition sensitivity of 94.62% (40 errors/744 classifications), accuracy = 99.37%, specificity = 99.66% with classification time of single sample = 0.8736 (s) in detecting 17 arrhythmia ECG classes. The proposed model can be applied in cloud computing or implemented in mobile devices to evaluate the cardiac health immediately with highest precision.

J	Onan, A				Onan, Aytug			An ensemble scheme based on language function analysis and feature engineering for text genre classification	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Text genre; language function analysis; ensemble learning	IDENTIFICATION; EXTRACTION	Text genre classification is the process of identifying functional characteristics of text documents. The immense quantity of text documents available on the web can be properly filtered, organised and retrieved with the use of text genre classification, which may have potential use on several other tasks of natural language processing and information retrieval. Genre may refer to several aspects of text documents, such as function and purpose. The language function analysis (LFA) concentrates on single aspect of genres and it aims to classify text documents into three abstract classes, such as expressive, appellative and informative. Text genre classification is typically performed by supervised machine learning algorithms. The extraction of an efficient feature set to represent text documents is an essential task for building a robust classification scheme with high predictive performance. In addition, ensemble learning, which combines the outputs of individual classifiers to obtain a robust classification scheme, is a promising research field in machine learning research. In this regard, this article presents an extensive comparative analysis of different feature engineering schemes (such as features used in authorship attribution, linguistic features, character n-grams, part of speech n-grams and the frequency of the most discriminative words) and five different base learners (Naive Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour and Random Forest) in conjunction with ensemble learning methods (such as Boosting, Bagging and Random Subspace). Based on the empirical analysis, an ensemble classification scheme is presented, which integrates Random Subspace ensemble of Random Forest with four types of features (features used in authorship attribution, character n-grams, part of speech n-grams and the frequency of the most discriminative words). For LFA corpus, the highest average predictive performance obtained by the proposed scheme is 94.43%.

In most of the state-of-the-arts of human emotion recognition, deep learning for emotion classification was used. However, deep learning is mostly effective for deep feature extraction. Therefore, in this research, we applied unsupervised deep belief network (DBN) for depth level feature extraction from fused observations of Electro-Dermal Activity (EDA), Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Zygomaticus Electromyography (zEMG) sensors signals. Afterwards, the DBN produced features are combined with statistical features of EDA, PPG and zEMG to prepare a feature-fusion vector. The prepared feature vector is then used to classify five basic emotions namely Happy, Relaxed, Disgust, Sad and Neutral. As the emotion classes are not linearly separable from the feature-fusion vector, the Fine Gaussian Support Vector Machine (FGSVM) is used with radial basis function kernel for non-linear classification of human emotions. Our experiments on a public multimodal physiological signal dataset show that the DBN, and FGSVM based model significantly increases the accuracy of emotion recognition rate as compared to the existing state-of-the-art emotion classification techniques.

PM2.5 is affected by both natural and anthropogenic factors that usually have strong diurnal variations. Such information helps toward understanding the causes of air pollution, as well as our adaptation to it. Most existing PM2.5 products have been derived from polarorbiting satellites. This study exploits the use of the nextgeneration geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari-8/AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) to document the diurnal variation in PM2.5. Given the huge volume of satellite data, based on the idea of gradient boosting, a highly efficient tree-based Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) method by involving the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution, namely the space-time LightGBM (STLG) model, is developed. An hourly PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM(2.5)) at a 5 km spatial resolution is derived based on Himawari-8/AHI aerosol products with additional environmental variables. Hourly PM2.5 estimates (number of data samples = 1 415 188) are well correlated with ground measurements in China (cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R-2 = 0.85), with a root-meansquare error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 13.62 and 8.49 mu g m(-3), respectively. Our model captures well the PM2.5 diurnal variations showing that pollution increases gradually in the morning, reaching a peak at about 10:00 LT (GMT+8), then decreases steadily until sunset. The proposed approach outperforms most traditional statistical regression and tree-based machine-learning models with a much lower computational burden in terms of speed and memory, making it most suitable for routine pollution monitoring.

However, many existing photo enhancement methods either deliver unsatisfactory results or consume too much computational and memory resources, hindering their application to high-resolution images (usually with more than 12 megapixels) in practice. In this paper, we learn image-adaptive 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs) to achieve fast and robust photo enhancement. 3D LUTs are widely used for manipulating color and tone of photos, but they are usually manually tuned and fixed in camera imaging pipeline or photo editing tools. We, for the first time to our best knowledge, propose to learn 3D LUTs from annotated data using pairwise or unpaired learning. More importantly, our learned 3D LUT is image-adaptive for flexible photo enhancement. We learn multiple basis 3D LUTs and a small convolutional neural network (CNN) simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. The small CNN works on the down-sampled version of the input image to predict content-dependent weights to fuse the multiple basis 3D LUTs into an image-adaptive one, which is employed to transform the color and tone of source images efficiently. Our model contains less than 600K parameters and takes less than 2 ms to process an image of 4K resolution using one Titan RTX GPU. While being highly efficient, our model also outperforms the state-of-the-art photo enhancement methods by a large margin in terms of PSNR, SSIM and a color difference metric on two publically available benchmark datasets.

The optical-to-optical nonlinearity operates by converting a small portion of the input optical signal into an analog electric signal, which is used to intensity-modulate the original optical signal with no reduction in processing speed. Our scheme allows for complete nonlinear ON-OFF contrast in transmission at relatively low optical power thresholds and eliminates the requirement of having additional optical sources between each of the layers of the network Moreover, the activation function is reconfigurable via electrical bias, allowing it to be programmed or trained to synthesize a variety of nonlinear responses. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this activation function significantly improves the expressiveness of optical neural networks, allowing them to perform well on two benchmark machine learning tasks: learning a multi-input exclusive-OR (XOR) logic function and classification of images of handwritten numbers from the MNIST dataset. The addition of the nonlinear activation function improves test accuracy on the MNIST task from 85% to 94%.	[Williamson, Ian A.

Searching for the optimal feature subset amongst an unabridged dataset is a challenging problem, especially for large-scale datasets. In this research, a binary Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) with asynchronous updating rules and a new leadership structure is proposed. To set the best leadership structure, several extensive experiments are performed to determine the most effective number of leaders in the social organization of the artificial salp chain. Inspired from the behavior of a termite colony (TC) in dividing the termites into four types, the salp chain is then divided into several sub-chains, where the salps in each sub-chain can follow a different strategy to adaptively update their locations. Three different updating strategies are employed in this paper. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated on 20 well-known datasets from the UCI repository. The results and comparisons verify that utilizing half of the salps as leaders of the chain can significantly improve the performance of SSA in terms of accuracy metric. Furthermore, dynamically tuning the single parameter of algorithm enable it to more effectively explore the search space in dealing with different feature selection datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tran, MQ; Liu, MK; Elsisi, M				Tran, Minh-Quang; Liu, Meng-Kun; Elsisi, Mahmoud			Effective multi-sensor data fusion for chatter detection in milling process	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Chatter detection; Wavelet packet decomposition; Time-frequency analysis; Multi -sensor fusion; Machine learning	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; DETECTION SYSTEM; SIGNAL; IDENTIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION	This paper introduces a newly developed multi-sensor data fusion for the milling chatter detection with a cheap and easy implementation compared with traditional chatter detection schemes. The proposed multi-sensor data fusion utilizes microphone and accelerometer sensors to measure the occurrence of chatter during the milling process. It has the advantageous over the dynamometer in terms of easy installation and low cost. In this paper, the wavelet packet decomposition is adopted to analyze both measured sound and vibration signals. However, the parameters of the wavelet packet decomposition require fine-tuning to provide good performance. Hence the result of the developed scheme has been improved by optimizing the selection of the wavelet packet decomposition parameters including the mother wavelet and the decomposition level based on the kurtosis and crest factors. Furthermore, the important chatter features are selected using the recursive feature elimination method, and its performance is compared with metaheuristic algorithms. Finally, several machine learning techniques have been adopted to classify the cutting stabilities based on the selected features. The results confirm that the proposed multi-sensor data fusion scheme can provide an effective chatter detection under industrial conditions, and it has higher accuracy than the traditional schemes.

The lack of high-quality medical resources, especially highly skilled doctors, in remote areas makes the diagnosis of breast cancer inefficient and causes great harm to women. The emergence of remote e-health has improved the situation to a certain extent, but its capabilities are still hampered by technical limitations, which manifest in two main aspects. First, due to network bandwidth limitations, it is difficult to guarantee the real-time transmission of breast cancer pathology images between remote areas and cities. Second, the highly skilled breast cancer doctors at large city hospitals are not guaranteed to be available for online diagnosis at all times. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a deep-learning-empowered breast cancer auxiliary diagnosis scheme for remote e-health supported by 5G technology and beyond (5GB remote e-health). In this scheme, breast pathology images are first received from major hospitals via 5G, and a deep learning model based on the Inception-v3 network is subjected to transfer learning to obtain a diagnostic model. This diagnostic model is then employed on edge servers for auxiliary diagnosis at remote area hospitals. A theoretical analysis and experimental results show that this solution not only overcomes the two problems mentioned above but also improves the diagnostic accuracy for breast cancer in remote areas to 98.19 percent.

A promising avenue is the secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs), where patient data are analyzed to conduct clinical and translational research. Methods based on machine learning to process EHRs are resulting in improved understanding of patient clinical trajectories and chronic disease risk prediction, creating a unique opportunity to derive previously unknown clinical insights. However, a wealth of clinical histories remains locked behind clinical narratives in free-form text. Consequently, unlocking the full potential of EHR data is contingent on the development of natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically transform clinical text into structured clinical data that can guide clinical decisions and potentially delay or prevent disease onset. Objective: The goal of the research was to provide a comprehensive overview of the development and uptake of NLP methods applied to free-text clinical notes related to chronic diseases, including the investigation of challenges faced by NLP methodologies in understanding clinical narratives. Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and searches were conducted in 5 databases using "clinical notes," " natural language processing," and " chronic disease" and their variations as keywords to maximize coverage of the articles. Results: Of the 2652 articles considered, 106 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the included papers resulted in identification of 43 chronic diseases, which were then further classified into 10 disease categories using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The majority of studies focused on diseases of the circulatory system (n=38) while endocrine and metabolic diseases were fewest (n=14). This was due to the structure of clinical records related to metabolic diseases, which typically contain much more structured data, compared with medical records for diseases of the circulatory system, which focus more on unstructured data and consequently have seen a stronger focus of NLP. The review has shown that there is a significant increase in the use of machine learning methods compared to rule-based approaches; however, deep learning methods remain emergent (n=3). Consequently, the majority of works focus on classification of disease phenotype with only a handful of papers addressing extraction of comorbidities from the free text or integration of clinical notes with structured data. There is a notable use of relatively simple methods, such as shallow classifiers (or combination with rule-based methods), due to the interpretability of predictions, which still represents a significant issue for more complex methods. Finally, scarcity of publicly available data may also have contributed to insufficient development of more advanced methods, such as extraction of word embeddings from clinical notes. Conclusions: Efforts are still required to improve (1) progression of clinical NLP methods from extraction toward understanding; (2) recognition of relations among entities rather than entities in isolation; (3) temporal extraction to understand past, current, and future clinical events; (4) exploitation of alternative sources of clinical knowledge; and (5) availability of large-scale, de-identified clinical corpora.

Deep convolutional neural network based medical image classification for disease diagnosis	JOURNAL OF BIG DATA			English	Article						CNN; Transfer learning; Capsule network; ORB; SVM; Image classification		Medical image classification plays an essential role in clinical treatment and teaching tasks. However, the traditional method has reached its ceiling on performance. Moreover, by using them, much time and effort need to be spent on extracting and selecting classification features. The deep neural network is an emerging machine learning method that has proven its potential for different classification tasks. Notably, the convolutional neural network dominates with the best results on varying image classification tasks. However, medical image datasets are hard to collect because it needs a lot of professional expertise to label them. Therefore, this paper researches how to apply the convolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithm on a chest X-ray dataset to classify pneumonia. Three techniques are evaluated through experiments. These are linear support vector machine classifier with local rotation and orientation free features, transfer learning on two convolutional neural network models: Visual Geometry Group i.e., VGG16 and InceptionV3, and a capsule network training from scratch. Data augmentation is a data preprocessing method applied to all three methods. The results of the experiments show that data augmentation generally is an effective way for all three algorithms to improve performance. Also, Transfer learning is a more useful classification method on a small dataset compared to a support vector machine with oriented fast and rotated binary (ORB) robust independent elementary features and capsule network. In transfer learning, retraining specific features on a new target dataset is essential to improve performance. And, the second important factor is a proper network complexity that matches the scale of the dataset.

Good knowledge about rock mechanical properties significantly facilitates fracturing design and in situ stresses estimation. Conventionally, rock elastic properties are estimated either experimentally or using well log data, known as static and dynamic, respectively. Conducting experiments on core samples is costly, time consuming, and does not provide continuous information. While dynamic Young's modulus provides a complete profile, however, it needs the availability of acoustic logs, and its estimations differ from the static values. The objective of this article is to create a continuous profile of Young's modulus using the drilling rig sensors records. The presented approach relies on the fact that the drilling data such as drill pipe torque, weight on bit, and rate of penetration are available at an early stage without additional cost. Three machine learning algorithms were used to correlate the drilling data with Young's modulus: random forest, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and functional network. Two different datasets were used in this study, one construct and test the model, while the other was hidden from the algorithms and used later to validate the built models. The two datasets contain over 3900 data points and cover different types of rocks. Two out of the three methods utilized yielded a remarkable match between the given and the predicted values. The correlation coefficients ranged between 0.92 and 0.99 average absolute percentage errors were less than 13%. Supported by these results, the utilization of drilling data and artificial intelligence techniques to predict the elastic moduli is promising. This approach could be investigated for other geomechanical properties, besides the performance of other machine learning methods for the same purpose.

It is also very necessary to provide sustainable computing for the the Internet of Things (IoT). Machine learning techniques play a vital role in the cybersecurity of the IoT for intrusion detection and malicious identification. Thus, in this study, we develop new feature extraction and selection methods and for the IDS system using the advantages of the swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms. We design a feature extraction mechanism depending on the conventional neural networks (CNN). After that, we present an alternative feature selection (FS) approach using the recently developed SI algorithm, Aquila optimizer (AQU). Moreover, to assess the quality of the developed IDS approach, four well-known public datasets, CIC2017, NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and KDD99, were used. We also considered extensive comparisons to other optimization methods to verify the competitive performance of the developed method. The results show the high performance of the developed approach using different evaluation indicators.

In this study, we aim to investigate and compare the performance of two state-of-the-art machine learning models, i.e., decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) approaches to model the massive rainfall-triggered landslide occurrences in the Izu-Oshima Volcanic Island, Japan at a regional scale. At first, a landslide inventory map is prepared consisting of 44 landslide polygons (10,444 pixels) from aerial photo-interpretation and field surveys. To estimate the robustness of the models, we randomly adapted two different samples (S1 and S2), comprising of both positive and negative cells (70% of total landslides - 7293 pixels) for training and remaining (30%-3151 pixels) for validation. Twelve causative factors including altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, total curvature, compound topographic index, stream power index, distance to drainage network, drainage density, distance to geological boundaries, lithology and cumulative rainfall were selected as predictors to implement the landslide susceptibility model. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) and other statistical signifiers were used to verify the model accuracies. The result shows that the DT and RF models achieved remarkable predictive performance (AUC > 0.9), producing near accurate susceptibility maps. The overall efficiency of RF (AUC = 0.956) is found significantly higher than the DT (AUC = 0.928) results. Additionally, we noticed that the performance of RF for modeling landslide susceptibility is very robust even though the training and validation samples are altered. Considering the performances, we suggest that both RF and DT models can be used in other similar non-eruption-related landslide studies in the tephra-deposited rich volcanoes, as they are capable of rapidly generating accurate and stable LSM maps for risk mitigation, management practices, and decision-making. Moreover, the RF-based model is promising and enough to be recommended as a method to map regional landslide susceptibility. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, in many applications, it is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to obtain large quantities of labeled data. To cope with limited labeled training data, many have attempted to directly apply models trained on a large-scale labeled source domain to another sparsely labeled or unlabeled target domain. Unfortunately, direct transfer across domains often performs poorly due to the presence of domain shift or dataset bias. Domain adaptation (DA) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to learn a model from a source domain that can perform well on a different (but related) target domain. In this article, we review the latest single-source deep unsupervised DA methods focused on visual tasks and discuss new perspectives for future research. We begin with the definitions of different DA strategies and the descriptions of existing benchmark datasets. We then summarize and compare different categories of single-source unsupervised DA methods, including discrepancy-based methods, adversarial discriminative methods, adversarial generative methods, and self-supervision-based methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions with challenges and possible solutions.

However, these models can be notoriously hard to interpret. In this Review, Jimenez-Luna and colleagues summarize recent approaches to use explainable artificial intelligence techniques in drug discovery. Deep learning bears promise for drug discovery, including advanced image analysis, prediction of molecular structure and function, and automated generation of innovative chemical entities with bespoke properties. Despite the growing number of successful prospective applications, the underlying mathematical models often remain elusive to interpretation by the human mind. There is a demand for 'explainable' deep learning methods to address the need for a new narrative of the machine language of the molecular sciences. This Review summarizes the most prominent algorithmic concepts of explainable artificial intelligence, and forecasts future opportunities, potential applications as well as several remaining challenges. We also hope it encourages additional efforts towards the development and acceptance of explainable artificial intelligence techniques.

Similar to other computational approaches, VS intention is not to replace in vitro or in vivo assays, but to speed up the discovery process, to reduce the number of candidates to be tested experimentally, and to rationalize their choice. Moreover, VS has become very popular in pharmaceutical companies and academic organizations due to its time-, cost-, resources-, and labor-saving. Among the VS approaches, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis is the most powerful method due to its high and fast throughput and good hit rate. As the first preliminary step of a QSAR model development, relevant chemogenomics data are collected from databases and the literature. Then, chemical descriptors are calculated on different levels of representation of molecular structure, ranging from 1D to nD, and then correlated with the biological property using machine learning techniques. Once developed and validated, QSAR models are applied to predict the biological property of novel compounds. Although the experimental testing of computational hits is not an inherent part of QSAR methodology, it is highly desired and should be performed as an ultimate validation of developed models. In this mini-review, we summarize and critically analyze the recent trends of QSAR-based VS in drug discovery and demonstrate successful applications in identifying perspective compounds with desired properties. Moreover, we provide some recommendations about the best practices for QSAR-based VS along with the future perspectives of this approach.

J	He, Y; Jiang, ZH; Chen, C; Wang, XS				He, Yin; Jiang, Zehang; Chen, Cai; Wang, Xiaosheng			Classification of triple-negative breast cancers based on Immunogenomic profiling	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article						Triple-negative breast cancer; Tumor immunity; Immunogenomic profiling; Classification; Machine learning	CTLA-4 BLOCKADE; PREDICTIVE BIOMARKER; PD-L1 EXPRESSION; IMMUNOTHERAPY; REVEALS; TUMOR; LANDSCAPE; SURVIVAL; IMMUNITY; SUBTYPES	BackgroundAbundant evidence shows that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is heterogeneous, and many efforts have been devoted to identifying TNBC subtypes on the basis of genomic profiling. However, few studies have explored the classification of TNBC specifically based on immune signatures that may facilitate the optimal stratification of TNBC patients responsive to immunotherapy.MethodsUsing four publicly available TNBC genomics datasets, we classified TNBC on the basis of the immunogenomic profiling of 29 immune signatures. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods were used to perform the classification.ResultsWe identified three TNBC subtypes that we named Immunity High (Immunity_H), Immunity Medium (Immunity_M), and Immunity Low (Immunity_L) and demonstrated that this classification was reliable and predictable by analyzing multiple different datasets. Immunity_H was characterized by greater immune cell infiltration and anti-tumor immune activities, as well as better survival prognosis compared to the other subtypes. Besides the immune signatures, some cancer-associated pathways were hyperactivated in Immunity_H, including apoptosis, calcium signaling, MAPK signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and RAS signaling. In contrast, Immunity_L presented depressed immune signatures and increased activation of cell cycle, Hippo signaling, DNA replication, mismatch repair, cell adhesion molecule binding, spliceosome, adherens junction function, pyrimidine metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, and RNA polymerase pathways. Furthermore, we identified a gene co-expression subnetwork centered around five transcription factor (TF) genes (CORO1A, STAT4, BCL11B, ZNF831, and EOMES) specifically significant in the Immunity_H subtype and a subnetwork centered around two TF genes (IRF8 and SPI1) characteristic of the Immunity_L subtype.ConclusionsThe identification of TNBC subtypes based on immune signatures has potential clinical implications for TNBC treatment.

The problem of joint deployment, phase shift design, as well as power allocation in the multiple-input-single-output (MISO) NOMA network is formulated for maximizing the energy efficiency with considering users particular data requirements. To tackle this pertinent problem, machine learning approaches are adopted in two steps. Firstly, a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) based echo state network (ESN) algorithm is proposed to predict users' tele-traffic demand by leveraging a real dataset. Secondly, a decaying double deep Q-network (D(3)QN) based position-acquisition and phase-control algorithm is proposed to solve the joint problem of deployment and design of the RIS. In the proposed algorithm, the base station, which controls the RIS by a controller, acts as an agent. The agent periodically observes the state of the RIS-enhanced system for attaining the optimal deployment and design policies of the RIS by learning from its mistakes and the feedback of users. Additionally, it is proved that the proposed D(3)QN based deployment and design algorithm is capable of converging within mild conditions. Simulation results are provided for illustrating that the proposed LSTM-based ESN algorithm is capable of striking a tradeoff between the prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed D(3)QN based algorithm outperforms the benchmarks, while the NOMA-enhanced RIS system is capable of achieving higher energy efficiency than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) enabled RIS system.

Normally, it has been commonly employed for classification, but it can be used to improve other disciplines such as feature selection. Feature selection consists of selecting the relevant features for a problem and discard those irrelevant or redundant, with the main goal of improving classification accuracy. In this work, we provide the reader with the basic concepts necessary to build an ensemble for feature selection, as well as reviewing the up-to-date advances and commenting on the future trends that are still to be faced.

For effective feature learning from small training data, cost function of convolution neural network (CNN) is modified by adding additional sparsity cost in the existing cost function. A novel trigonometric cross-entropy function is developed to compute the sparsity cost. The proposed cost function introduces sparsity by avoiding unnecessary activation of neurons in the hidden layers of CNN. For identification of bearing defects from small training samples, NCNN-based transfer learning is applied in the following manner. First, the raw vibration signals as well as envelope signals from source domain machine are obtained. Thereafter, these envelope signals are applied to NCNN for the learning of features from the big training data acquitted from the source domain. After feature learning, knowledge gained from NCNN is transferred to do fine-tuning of NCNN from small training samples of target domain. Thereafter, defect identification is carried out by applying the test data of target domain to fine-tuned NCNN. The experimental result validates that the proposed cross-entropy function introduces sparsity in CNN and, hence, creates an effective deep learning which can even work under a situation when training data are not available in abundant.

Data-driven discovery of coordinates and governing equations	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						model discovery; dynamical systems; machine learning; deep learning	SPARSE IDENTIFICATION; MODEL-REDUCTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; DECOMPOSITION	The discovery of governing equations from scientific data has the potential to transform data-rich fields that lack well-characterized quantitative descriptions. Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam's razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.	[Champion, Kathleen; Kutz, J.

In a highly selective process, MHC II presents peptides derived from exogenous antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells for T cell scrutiny. Understanding the rules defining this presentation holds critical insights into the regulation and potential manipulation of the cellular immune system. Here, we apply the NNAlign_MA machine learning framework to analyze and integrate large-scale eluted MHC II ligand mass spectrometry (MS) data sets to advance prediction of CD4+ epitopes. NNAlign_MA allows integration of mixed data types, handling ligands with multiple potential allele annotations, encoding of ligand context, leveraging information between data sets, and has pan-specific power allowing accurate predictions outside the set of molecules included in the training data. Applying this framework, we identified accurate binding motifs of more than SO MHC class II molecules described by MS data, particularly expanding coverage for DP and DQ beyond that obtained using current MS motif deconvolution techniques. Furthermore, in large-scale benchmarking, the final model termed NetMHCIIpan-4.0 demonstrated improved performance beyond current state-of-the-art predictors for ligand and CD4+ T cell epitope prediction. These results suggest that NNAlign_MA and NetMHCIIpan-4.0 are powerful tools for analysis of immunopeptidome MS data, prediction of T cell epitopes, and development of personalized immunotherapies.

Consumer reviews posted in social media are increasing at an exponential rate both in terms of number and relevance, which leads to big data. In this paper, a hybrid approach of two deep learning architectures namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (RNN with memory) is suggested for sentiment classification of reviews posted at diverse domains. Deep convolutional networks have been highly effective in local feature selection, while recurrent networks (LSTM) often yield good results in the sequential analysis of a long text. The proposed Co-LSTM model is mainly aimed at two objectives in sentiment analysis. First, it is highly adaptable in examining big social data, keeping scalability in mind, and secondly, unlike the conventional machine learning approaches, it is free from any particular domain. The experiment has been carried out on four review datasets from diverse domains to train the model which can handle all kinds of dependencies that usually arises in a post. The experimental results show that the proposed ensemble model outperforms other machine learning approaches in terms of accuracy and other parameters.

Crop type mapping without field-level labels: Random forest transfer and unsupervised clustering techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Classification; Unsupervised learning; Agriculture; Landsat; Lind cover; Machine learning; Google Earth Engine; Big data; Remote sensing	COVER; RESOLUTION; AREA; CORN; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; MAIZE; NDVI	Crop type mapping at the field level is necessary for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring and food security. As remote sensing imagery continues to increase in spatial and temporal resolution, it is becoming an increasingly powerful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, automated crop type mapping remains constrained by a lack of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models, in this study, we explore the use of random forests transferred across geographic distance and time and unsupervised methods in conjunction with aggregate crop statistics for crop type mapping in the US Midwest, where we simulated the label-poor setting by depriving the models of labels in various states and years. We validated our methodology using available 30 m spatial resolution crop type labels from the US Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Using Google Earth Engine, we computed Fourier transforms (or harmonic regressions) on the time series of Landsat Surface Reflectance and derived vegetation indices, and extracted the coefficients as features for machine learning models. We found that random forests trained on regions and years similar in growing degree days (ODD) transfer to the target region with accuracies consistently exceeding 80%. Accuracies decrease as differences in GDD expand. Unsupervised Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with class labels derived using county-level crop statistics classify crops less consistently but require no field-level labels for training. GMM achieves over 85% accuracy in states with low crop diversity (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska), but performs sometimes no better than random when high crop diversity interferes with clustering (North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan). Under the appropriate conditions, these methods offer options for field-resolution crop type mapping in regions around the world with few or no ground labels.

The combination of improved availability of large datasets, increasing computing power, and advances in learning algorithms has created major performance breakthroughs in the development of AI applications. In the last 5 years, AI techniques known as deep learning have delivered rapidly improving performance in image recognition, caption generation, and speech recognition. Radiology, in particular, is a prime candidate for early adoption of these techniques. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in radiology over the next decade will significantly improve the quality, value, and depth of radiology's contribution to patient care and population health, and will revolutionize radiologists' workflows. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) is the national voice of radiology committed to promoting the highest standards in patient-centered imaging, lifelong learning, and research. The CAR has created an AI working group with the mandate to discuss and deliberate on practice, policy, and patient care issues related to the introduction and implementation of AI in imaging. This white paper provides recommendations for the CAR derived from deliberations between members of the AI working group. This white paper on AI in radiology will inform CAR members and policymakers on key terminology, educational needs of members, research and development, partnerships, potential clinical applications, implementation, structure and governance, role of radiologists, and potential impact of AI on radiology in Canada.

While the available damage detection methods have been in the process of adapting machine learning concepts, most machine learning based methods extract "hand-crafted" features which are fixed and manually selected in advance. Their performance varies significantly among various patterns of data depending on the particular structure under analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), on the other hand, can fuse and simultaneously optimize two major sets of an assessment task (feature extraction and classification) into a single learning block during the training phase. This ability not only provides an improved classification performance but also yields a superior computational efficiency. 1D CNNs have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in vibration-based structural damage detection; however, it has been reported that the training of the CNNs requires significant amount of measurements especially in large structures. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper presents an enhanced CNN-based approach that requires only two measurement sets regardless of the size of the structure. This approach is verified using the experimental data of the Phase II benchmark problem of structural health monitoring which had been introduced by IASC-ASCE Structural Health Monitoring Task Group. As a result, it is shown that the enhanced CNN-based approach successfully estimated the actual amount of damage for the nine damage scenarios of the benchmark study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional spectral methods for soil heavy metal monitoring and assessment cannot meet the needs for large-scale areas. Therefore, in this study, we used HyMap-C airborne hyperspectral imagery to explore the estimation of soil heavy metal concentration. Ninety five soil samples were collected synchronously with airborne image acquisition in the mining area of Yitong County, China. The pre-processed spectrum of airborne images at the sampling point was then selected by the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method. The selected spectral features and the heavy metal data of soil samples were inverted to establish the inversion model. An ensemble learning method based on a stacking strategy is proposed for the inversion modeling of soil samples and image data. The experimental results show that this CARS -Stacking method can better predict the four heavy metals in the study area than other methods. For arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), the determination coefficients of the test data set (R-p(2)) are 0.73, 0.63, 0.60, and 0.71, respectively. It was found that the estimated results and the distribution trend of heavy metals are almost the same as in actual ground measurements.

A hot research topic has been the ability to predict landslide susceptibility, which can be used to design schemes of land exploitation and urban development in mountainous areas. In this study, the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) and satin bowerbird optimizer (SBO) algorithms were applied to optimize the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for landslide susceptibility mapping. In the study area, 152 landslides were identified and randomly divided into two groups as training (70%) and validation (30%) dataset. Additionally, a total of fifteen landslide influencing factors were selected. The relative importance and weights of various influencing factors were determined using the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. Finally, the comprehensive performance of the two models was validated and compared using various indexes, such as the root mean square error (RMSE), processing time, convergence, and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). The results demonstrated that the AUROC values of the ANFIS, ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS-SBO models with the training data were 0.808, 0.785 and 0.755, respectively. In terms of the validation dataset, the ANFIS-SBO model exhibited a higher AUROC value of 0.781, while the AUROC value of the ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS models were 0.749 and 0.681, respectively. Moreover, the ANFIS-SBO model showed lower RMSE values for the validation dataset, indicating that the SBO algorithm had a better optimization capability. Meanwhile, the processing time and convergence of the ANFIS-SBO model were far superior to those of the ANFIS-TLBO model. Therefore, both the ensemble models proposed in this paper can generate adequate results, and the ANFIS-SBO model is recommended as the more suitable model for landslide susceptibility assessment in the study area considered due to its excellent accuracy and efficiency.

This work presents a novel diagnosis framework that combines the spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) approach with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to build a hybrid ST-CNN scheme. The proposed framework is tested on two data sets for diagnosing unseen operating conditions and fault severities respectively, to evaluate its generalization ability, which is essential for the application in machine fault diagnosis as not all of the aforementioned scenarios have sufficient labeled data to train a model. The results show that the proposed ST-CNN framework outperforms or is comparable to shallow methods (support vector machine and random forest) and 1D CNN. Through visualizing the activations, it is verified that the spatial features can elevate the diagnosis accuracy, and more general features are determined by the proposed approach to form an adaptive classifier for diverse operating conditions and different fault severities.

Short-term forecasting of the coronavirus pandemic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						Automatic forecasting; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Forecasting; Forecast averaging; Machine learning; Smoothing; Time series; Trend indicator saturation		We have been publishing real-time forecasts of confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since mid-March 2020 (published at www.doornik.com/COVID-19). These forecasts are short-term statistical extrapolations of past and current data. They assume that the underlying trend is informative regarding short-term developments but without requiring other assumptions about how the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is spreading, or whether preventative policies are effective. Thus, they are complementary to the forecasts obtained from epidemiological models. The forecasts are based on extracting trends from windows of data using machine learning and then computing the forecasts by applying some constraints to the flexible extracted trend. These methods have been applied previously to various other time series data and they performed well. They have also proved effective in the COVID-19 setting where they provided better forecasts than some epidemiological models in the earlier stages of the pandemic. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, in the real-world applications, it is often infeasible to conduct a timely and yet comprehensive observation due to resource constraints. In view of such a practical challenge, the goal of this work is to develop a novel computational method for performing active observations, termed active surveillance, with limited resources. Specifically, we aim to predict the dynamics of a large spatio-temporal diffusion system based on the observations of some of its components. Towards this end, we introduce a novel measure, the y value, that enables us to identify the key components by means of modeling a sentinel network with a row sparsity structure. Having obtained a theoretical understanding of the y value, we design a backward-selection sentinel network mining algorithm (SNMA) for deriving the sentinel network via group sparse Bayesian learning. In order to be practically useful, we further address the issue of scalability in the computation of SNMA, and moreover, extend SNMA to the case of a non-linear dynamical system that could involve complex diffusion mechanisms. We show the effectiveness of SNMA by validating it using both synthetic datasets and five real-world datasets. The experimental results are appealing, which demonstrate that SNMA readily outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

However, given complex industrial scenarios, DA-based methods usually fail when the working conditions of machines are unseen, i.e., target data are unavailable during model training. In this article, a generic domain-regressive framework for fault diagnosis, namely, adversarial domain-invariant generalization (ADIG), is proposed. ADIG leverages multiple available domain data to exploit domain-invariant knowledge through adversarial learning between the feature extractor and the domain classifier. Simultaneously, the fault classifier generalizes the knowledge from the source-related domain to diagnose the unseen but related target domain signals. Moreover, customized strategies of feature normalization and adaptive weight are proposed to promote diagnosis performance. Comprehensive case studies show that ADIG achieves satisfactory diagnosis accuracy and robustness under unseen conditions, indicating that ADIG is a remarkably potential diagnosis tool for real-case industrial machines.

Novel Feature Selection and Voting Classifier Algorithms for COVID-19 Classification in CT Images	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Computed tomography; Feature extraction; Optimization; Support vector machines; Sensitivity; Lung; Machine learning; COVID-19; CT scans; convolutional neural network; guided whale optimization algorithm; features selection; voting ensemble	NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH; WOLF	Diagnosis is a critical preventive step in Coronavirus research which has similar manifestations with other types of pneumonia. CT scans and X-rays play an important role in that direction. However, processing chest CT images and using them to accurately diagnose COVID-19 is a computationally expensive task. Machine Learning techniques have the potential to overcome this challenge. This article proposes two optimization algorithms for feature selection and classification of COVID-19. The proposed framework has three cascaded phases. Firstly, the features are extracted from the CT scans using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named AlexNet. Secondly, a proposed features selection algorithm, Guided Whale Optimization Algorithm (Guided WOA) based on Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS), is then applied followed by balancing the selected features. Finally, a proposed voting classifier, Guided WOA based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), aggregates different classifiers' predictions to choose the most voted class. This increases the chance that individual classifiers, e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Trees (DT), to show significant discrepancies. Two datasets are used to test the proposed model: CT images containing clinical findings of positive COVID-19 and CT images negative COVID-19. The proposed feature selection algorithm (SFS-Guided WOA) is compared with other optimization algorithms widely used in recent literature to validate its efficiency.

LULC transformation due to enormous urban expansion diminishing Ecosystem Services Values (ESVs) and discouraging sustainability. Though unplanned LULC transformation practice became more prevalent in developing countries, comprehensive assessment of LULC changes and their influences in ESVs are rarely attempted. This study aimed to illustrate and forecast the LULC changes and their influences on ESVs change in Jashore using remote sensing technologies. ESVs estimation and change analysis were conducted by utilizing -derived LULC data of the year 2000, 2010, and 2020 with the corresponding global value coefficients of each LULC type which are previously published. For simulating future LULC and ESVs, Land Change Modeler of TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling Software was used in Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain and Artificial Neural Network method. The decline of agricultural land by 13.13% and waterbody by 5.79% has resulted in the reduction of total ESVs US$0.23 million (24.47%) during 2000-2020. The forecasted result shows that the built-up area will be dominant LULC in the future, and ESVs of provisioning and cultural services will be diminished by $0.107 million, $63400.3 by 2050 with the declination of agricultural, waterbody, vegetation, and vacant land covers. The study signifies the importance of a strategic rational land-use plan to strictly monitor and control the encroachment of built-up areas into vegetation, waterbodies, and agricultural land in addition to scientific mitigative policies for ensuring ecological sustainability.

Most of the epidemiological studies have been conducted in cities because of the lack of reliable spatiotemporal estimates of particles exposure in nonurban settings. The objective of this study is to estimate daily PM10 (PM < 10 mu m), fine (PM < 2.5 mu m, PM2.5) and coarse particles (PM between 2.5 and 10 mu m, PM2.5-10) at 1-km(2) grid for 2013-2015 using a machine learning approach, the Random Forest (RF). Separate RF models were defined to: predict PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 concentrations in monitors where only PM10 data were available (stage 1); impute missing satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data using estimates from atmospheric ensemble models (stage 2); establish a relationship between measured PM and satellite, land use and meteorological parameters (stage 3); predict stage 3 model over each 1-km(2) grid cell of Italy (stage 4); and improve stage 3 predictions by using small-scale predictors computed at the monitor locations or within a small buffer (stage 5). Our models were able to capture most of PM variability, with mean crossvalidation (CV) R-2 of 0.75 and 0.80 (stage 3) and 0.84 and 0.86 (stage 5) for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Model fitting was less optimal for PM2.5-10, in summer months and in southern Italy. Finally, predictions were equally good in capturing annual and daily PM variability, therefore they can be used as reliable exposure estimates for investigating long-term and short-term health effects.

The power energy management of smart grid is of great importance for energy distribution, system security, and market economics. One of the most important issues is the accurate and stable prediction of wind speed for the optimal operation and management of wind power generations connected to smart grid. In this paper, a novel two-layer nonlinear combination method termed as EEL-ELM is developed for short-term wind speed prediction problems, such as 10-min ahead and 1-h ahead. The first layer is based on extreme learning machine (ELM), Elman neural network (ENN), and long short term memory neural network (LSTM) to separately forecast wind speed by making use of their merits of calculation speed or strong ability in forecasting, and obtain three forecasting results. Then, we propose the second layer by making use of ELM-based nonlinear aggregated mechanism to alleviate the inherent weakness of single method and linear combination. Two real-world case studies, gathered from Inner Mongolia's wind farm in China, are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EEL-ELM method. By comparing with other eight wind speed prediction methods, the simulation results reveal that EEL-ELM can achieve better forecasting performance according to three evaluation metrics and three statistical tests.

J	Liang, X				Liang, Xiao			Image-based post-disaster inspection of reinforced concrete bridge systems using deep learning with Bayesian optimization	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACHINE VISION; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION	Many bridge structures, one of the most critical components in transportation infrastructure systems, exhibit signs of deteriorations and are approaching or beyond the initial design service life. Therefore, structural health inspections of these bridges are becoming critically important, especially after extreme events. To enhance the efficiency of such an inspection, in recent years, autonomous damage detection based on computer vision has become a research hotspot. This article proposes a three-level image-based approach for post-disaster inspection of the reinforced concrete bridge using deep learning with novel training strategies. The convolutional neural network for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation are, respectively, proposed to conduct system-level failure classification, component-level bridge column detection, and local damage-level damage localization. To enable efficient training and prediction using a small data set, the model robustness is a crucial aspect to be taken into account, generally through its hyperparameters' selection. This article, based on Bayesian optimization, proposes a principled manner of such selection, with which very promising results (well over 90% accuracies) and robustness are observed on all three-level deep learning models.

An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field's contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence. Deep neural networks have become very successful at certain machine learning tasks partly due to the widely adopted method of training called backpropagation. An alternative way to optimize neural networks is by using evolutionary algorithms, which, fuelled by the increase in computing power, offers a new range of capabilities and modes of learning.

We explored the potential of Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) classification models, in the context of small dataset of 80 samples, for outcome prediction in high-risk kidney transplantation. The DT and RF models identified the key risk factors associated with acute rejection: the levels of the donor specific IgG antibodies, the levels of IgG4 subclass and the number of human leucocyte antigen mismatches between the donor and recipient. Furthermore, the DT model determined dangerous levels of donor-specific IgG subclass antibodies, thus demonstrating the potential of discovering new properties in the data when traditional statistical tools are unable to capture them. The DT and RF classifiers developed in this work predicted early transplant rejection with accuracy of 85%, thus offering an accurate decision support tool for doctors tasked with predicting outcomes of kidney transplantation in advance of the clinical intervention.

GWAS has been applied in wheat for different quality, biotic and abiotic stresses, and agronomic and yield-related traits. Predictions for marker-trait associations are controlled with the development of better statistical models taking population structure and familial relatedness into account. In this review, we have provided a detailed overview of the importance of association mapping, population design, high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping platforms, advancements in statistical models and multiple threshold comparisons, and recent GWA studies conducted in wheat. The information about MTAs utilized for gene characterization and adopted in breeding programs is also provided. In the literature that we surveyed, as many as 86,122 wheat lines have been studied under various GWA studies reporting 46,940 loci. However, further utilization of these is largely limited. The future breakthroughs in area of genomic selection, multi-omics-based approaches, machine, and deep learning models in wheat breeding after exploring the complex genetic structure with the GWAS are also discussed.

J	Wang, T; Ke, HX; Zheng, X; Wang, K; Sangaiah, AK; Liu, AF				Wang, Tian; Ke, Haoxiong; Zheng, Xi; Wang, Kun; Sangaiah, Arun Kumar; Liu, Anfeng			Big Data Cleaning Based on Mobile Edge Computing in Industrial Sensor-Cloud	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Data cleaning; edge computing; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); industrial sensor-cloud; online machine learning	BLOCKCHAIN	With the advent of 5G, the industrial Internet of Things has developed rapidly. The industrial sensor-cloud system (SCS) has also received widespread attention. In the future, a large number of integrated sensors that simultaneously collect multifeature data will be added to industrial SCS. However, the collected big data are not trustworthy due to the harsh environment of the sensor. If the data collected at the bottom networks are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, the query and data mining results will be inaccurate, which will seriously affect the judgment and feedback of the cloud. The traditional method of relying on sensor nodes for data cleaning is insufficient to deal with big data, whereas edge computing provides a good solution. In this article, a new data cleaning method is proposed based on the mobile edge node during data collection. An angle-based outlier detection method is applied at the edge node to obtain the training data of the cleaning model, which is then established through support vector machine. Besides, online learning is adopted for model optimization. Experimental results show that multidimensional data cleaning based on mobile edge nodes improves the efficiency of data cleaning while maintaining data reliability and integrity, and greatly reduces the bandwidth and energy consumption of the industrial SCS.

However, the couple effect of these influencing factors causes the difficulty in evaluating the overall comfort. This study revealed the potential comfort degradation mechanisms in high-speed railway environments and proposed a machine learning evaluation model to assess passenger comfort. Here, the subjective overall comfort ratings and the electroencephalography (EEG) of twenty passengers were collected in the field tests. Compared with passengers who were in a state of comfort, the brain areas (BA6/13/20/24/31/40/47) of pas-sengers who felt uncomfortable were all significantly activated in the beta band. Based on the neural signature above, three related human reactions when passengers feel uncomfortable were recognized, including perceiving the environment, inducing negative emotions, and finally producing body movement intention. To assess the overall comfort of train passengers, six kinds of features extracted from EEG signals were used to train an evaluation model based on the LightGBM algorithm. This work offers a neurological explanation for the mechanisms of degradation of overall comfort and provides a novel and effective method to assess it.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Municipal solid waste; Breitung-Candelon spectral Granger-causality; Waste sector; Recycling; Environmental sustainability; Machine learning	MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; RENEWABLE ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; CO2 EMISSIONS; OECD COUNTRIES; GROWTH; MANAGEMENT; PANEL; HYPOTHESIS	Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the most urgent issues associated with economic growth and urban population. When untreated, it generates harmful and toxic substances spreading out into the soils. When treated, they produce an important amount of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions directly contributing to global warming. With its promising path to sustainability, the Danish case is of high interest since estimated results are thought to bring useful information for policy purposes. Here, we exploit the most recent and available data period (1994-2017) and investigate the causal relationship between MSW generation per capita, income level, urbanization, and GHG emissions from the waste sector in Denmark. We use an experiment based on Artificial Neural Networks and the Breitung-Candelon Spectral Granger-causality test to understand how the variables, object of the study, manage to interact within a complex ecosystem such as the environment and waste. Through numerous tests in Machine Learning, we arrive at results that imply how economic growth, identifiable by changes in per capita GDP, affects the acceleration and the velocity of the neural signal with waste emissions. We observe a periodical shift from the traditional linear economy to a circular economy that has important policy implications. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

To leverage deep learning models especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for HSI classification, this paper proposes a simple yet effective method to extract hierarchical deep spatial feature for HSI classification by exploring the power of off-the-shelf CNN models, without any additional retraining or fine-tuning on the target data set. To obtain better classification accuracy, we further propose a unified metric learning-based framework to alternately learn discriminative spectral-spatial features, which have better representation capability and train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To this end, we design a new objective function that explicitly embeds a metric learning regularization term into SVM training. The metric learning regularization term is used to learn a powerful spectral-spatial feature representation by fusing spectral feature and deep spatial feature, which has small intraclass scatter but big between class separation. By transforming HSI data into new spectral-spatial feature space through CNN and metric learning, we can pull the pixels from the same class closer, while pushing the different class pixels farther away. In the experiments, we comprehensively evaluate the proposed method on three commonly used HSI benchmark data sets. State-of-the-art results are achieved when compared with the existing HSI classification methods.

J	Kim, H				Kim, HyungJun			Multiple vehicle tracking and classification system with a convolutional neural network	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Vehicle tracking system; Surveillance camera; Adaptive background extraction; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural networks		This paper proposes a traffic monitoring system that detects, tracks, and classifies multiple vehicles on the road in real time using various digital image processing techniques and the process of machine learning based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). With this system, a video camera is installed on the road, and calibration is used to obtain the projection equation of the actual road on the image plane. Several image processing techniques, such as background modeling, background extraction, edge detection, and object tracking, are used to develop and implement a prototype system. The proposed system also uses a transfer learning process that is more efficient than starting CNN from scratch. This maximizes training efficiency and increases prediction accuracy in vehicle classification. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that multiple vehicle tracking and classification are possible while calculating vehicle speed. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a single digital video camera system with embedded machine learning process that can monitor and distinguish multiple vehicles simultaneously in multiple lanes.

J	Tubishat, M; Abushariah, MAM; Idris, N; Aljarah, I				Tubishat, Mohammad; Abushariah, Mohammad A.

In SA, feature selection phase is an important phase for machine learning classifiers specifically when the datasets used in training is huge. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is one of the recent metaheuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the whale hunting mechanism. However, WOA suffers from the same problem faced by many other optimization algorithms and tend to fall in local optima. To overcome these problems, two improvements for WOA algorithm are proposed in this paper. The first improvement includes using Elite Opposition-Based Learning (EOBL) at initialization phase of WOA. The second improvement involves the incorporation of evolutionary operators from Differential Evolution algorithm at the end of each WOA iteration including mutation, crossover, and selection operators. In addition, we also used Information Gain (IG) as a filter features selection technique with WOA using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to reduce the search space explored by WOA. To verify our proposed approach, four Arabic benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis are used since there are only a few studies in sentiment analysis conducted for Arabic language as compared to English. The proposed algorithm is compared with six well-known optimization algorithms and two deep learning algorithms. The comprehensive experiments results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms all other algorithms in terms of sentiment analysis classification accuracy through finding the best solutions, while its also minimizes the number of selected features.

Due to a large number of antennas and radio frequency (RF) chains, complexity of the symbol detectors increased rapidly in a massive MIMO uplink receiver. Thus, the research to find the perfect massive MIMO detection algorithm with optimal performance and low complexity has gained a lot of attention during the past decade. A plethora of massive MIMO detection algorithms has been proposed in the literature. The aim of this paper is to provide insights on such algorithms to a generalist of wireless communications. We garner the massive MIMO detection algorithms and classify them so that a reader can find a distinction between different algorithms from a wider range of solutions. We present optimal and near-optimal detection principles specifically designed for the massive MIMO system such as detectors based on a local search, belief propagation and box detection. In addition, we cover detectors based on approximate inversion, which has gained popularity among the VLSI signal processing community due to their deterministic dataflow and low complexity. We also briefly explore several nonlinear small-scale MIMO (2-4 antenna receivers) detectors and their applicability in the massive MIMO context. In addition, we present recent advances of detection algorithms which are mostly based on machine learning or sparsity based algorithms. In each section, we also mention the related implementations of the detectors. A discussion of the pros and cons of each detector is provided.

An improved CNN based on LeNet-5 is constructed which can enhance the features of the samples by stacking bottleneck layers without changing the size of the samples. A new conversion approaches are also proposed for converting multi-sensor vibration signals into color images, and it can refine features and enlarge the differences between different types of fault signals by the fused images transformed in red-green-blue (RGB) color space. In the last stage of network learning, visual clustering is realized with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to evaluate the performance of the network. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, examples in practice such as the diagnosis for the wind power test rigs and industrial fan system are provided with the prediction accuracies of 99.89% and 99.77%, respectively. In addition, the efficiency of other comparative baseline approaches such as the deep belief network and support vector machine (SVM) is evaluated. In conclusion, the proposed intelligent diagnosis method based on multi-sensor data-fusion and CNN shows higher prediction accuracy and more obvious visualization clustering effects.

According to several online sources, this model has improved Google's speech recognition, greatly improved machine translations on Google Translate, and the answers of Amazon's Alexa. This neural system is also employed by Facebook, reaching over 4 billion LSTM-based translations per day as of 2017. Interestingly, recurrent neural networks had shown a rather discrete performance until LSTM showed up. One reason for the success of this recurrent network lies in its ability to handle the exploding/vanishing gradient problem, which stands as a difficult issue to be circumvented when training recurrent or very deep neural networks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review that covers LSTM's formulation and training, relevant applications reported in the literature and code resources implementing this model for a toy example.

We propose a fully automated approach for multiclass skin lesion segmentation and classification by using the most discriminant deep features. First, the input images are initially enhanced using local color-controlled histogram intensity values (LCcHIV). Next, saliency is estimated using a novel Deep Saliency Segmentation method, which uses a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) of ten layers. The generated heat map is converted into a binary image using a thresholding function. Next, the segmented color lesion images are used for feature extraction by a deep pre-trained CNN model. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, we implement an improved moth flame optimization (IMFO) algorithm to select the most discriminant features. The resultant features are fused using a multiset maximum correlation analysis (MMCA) and classified using the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) classifier. The segmentation performance of the proposed methodology is analyzed on ISBI 2016, ISBI 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets, achieving an accuracy of 95.38%, 95.79%, 92.69%, and 98.70%, respectively. The classification performance is evaluated on the HAM10000 dataset and achieved an accuracy of 90.67%. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we present a comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques.

However, classical ML exerts severe demands in terms of energy, memory, and computing resources, limiting their adoption for resource-constrained edge devices. The new breed of intelligent devices and high-stake applications (drones, augmented/virtual reality, autonomous systems, and so on) requires a novel paradigm change calling for distributed, low-latency and reliable ML at the wireless network edge (referred to as edge ML). In edge ML, training data are unevenly distributed over a large number of edge nodes, which have access to a tiny fraction of the data. Moreover, training and inference are carried out collectively over wireless links, where edge devices communicate and exchange their learned models (not their private data). In a first of its kind, this article explores the key building blocks of edge ML, different neural network architectural splits and their inherent tradeoffs, as well as theoretical and technical enablers stemming from a wide range of mathematical disciplines. Finally, several case studies pertaining to various high-stake applications are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of edge ML in unlocking the full potential of 5G and beyond.

The objective was to utilize an unsupervised clustering analysis to derive clinical COVID-19 phenotypes and to analyze patient's factors associated with mortality risk. Patient features including demographics and clinical data at ICU admission were analyzed. Generalized linear models were used to determine ICU morality risk factors. The prognostic models were validated and their performance was measured using accuracy test, sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves.ResultsThe database included a total of 2022 patients (mean age 64 [IQR 5-71] years, 1423 (70.4%) male, median APACHE II score (13 [IQR 10-17]) and SOFA score (5 [IQR 3-7]) points. The ICU mortality rate was 32.6%. Of the 3 derived phenotypes, the A (mild) phenotype (537; 26.7%) included older age (<65 years), fewer abnormal laboratory values and less development of complications, B (moderate) phenotype (623, 30.8%) had similar characteristics of A phenotype but were more likely to present shock. The C (severe) phenotype was the most common (857; 42.5%) and was characterized by the interplay of older age (>65 years), high severity of illness and a higher likelihood of development shock. Crude ICU mortality was 20.3%, 25% and 45.4% for A, B and C phenotype respectively. The ICU mortality risk factors and model performance differed between whole population and phenotype classifications.ConclusionThe presented machine learning model identified three clinical phenotypes that significantly correlated with host-response patterns and ICU mortality. Different risk factors across the whole population and clinical phenotypes were observed which may limit the application of a "one-size-fits-all" model in practice.

Remote sensing and machine learning approaches present an opportunity to enhance accuracy and efficiency of current practices. Quantitative biophysical models of photosynthetic, non-photosynthetic and bare cover fractions have not been widely applied to fire severity studies but may provide greater consistency in comparisons of different fires across the landscape compared to reflectance-based indices. We systematically tested and compared reflectance and fractional cover candidate severity indices derived from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery using a random forest (RF) machine learning framework. Assessment of predictive power (cross-validation) was undertaken to quantify the accuracy of mapping severity of new fires. The effect of environmental variables on the accuracy of the RF predicted severity classification was examined to assess the stability of the mapping across the landscape. The results indicate that fire severity can be mapped with very high accuracy using Sentinel 2 imagery and RF supervised classification. The mean accuracy was >95% for the unburnt and extreme severity class (complete crown consumption), >85% for high severity class (full crown scorch), >80% for low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy) and >70% for the moderate severity class (partial canopy scorch). Higher canopy cover and higher topographic complexity was associated with a higher rate of under-prediction, due to the limitations of optical sensors in viewing the burnt understorey of low severity classes under these conditions. Further research is aimed at improving classification accuracy of low and moderate severity classes and applying the RF algorithm to hazard reduction fires.

J	Zhou, DX				Zhou, Ding-Xuan			Universality of deep convolutional neural networks	APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS			English	Article						Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Universality; Approximation theory	MULTILAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; OPTIMAL APPROXIMATION; BOUNDS	Deep learning has been widely applied and brought breakthroughs in speech recognition, computer vision, and many other domains. Deep neural network architectures and computational issues have been well studied in machine learning. But there lacks a theoretical foundation for understanding the approximation or generalization ability of deep learning methods generated by the network architectures such as deep convolutional neural networks. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is universal, meaning that it can be used to approximate any continuous function to an arbitrary accuracy when the depth of the neural network is large enough. This answers an open question in learning theory. Our quantitative estimate, given tightly in terms of the number of free parameters to be computed, verifies the efficiency of deep CNNs in dealing with large dimensional data. Our study also demonstrates the role of convolutions in deep CNNs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The tremendous potential benefits of SA are, however, yet to be fully realized, both for advancing mechanistic and data-driven modeling of human and natural systems, and in support of decision making. In this perspective paper, a multidisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners revisit the current status of SA, and outline research challenges in regard to both theoretical frameworks and their applications to solve real-world problems. Six areas are discussed that warrant further attention, including (1) structuring and standardizing SA as a discipline, (2) realizing the untapped potential of SA for systems modeling, (3) addressing the computational burden of SA, (4) progressing SA in the context of machine learning, (5) clarifying the relationship and role of SA to uncertainty quantification, and (6) evolving the use of SA in support of decision making. An outlook for the future of SA is provided that underlines how SA must underpin a wide variety of activities to better serve science and society.

We present the first-time prospective application of a deep learning model for designing new druglike compounds with desired activities. For this purpose, we trained a recurrent neural network to capture the constitution of a large set of known bioactive compounds represented as SMILES strings. By transfer learning, this general model was fine-tuned on recognizing retinoid X and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists. We synthesized five top-ranking compounds designed by the generative model. Four of the compounds revealed nanomolar to low-micromolar receptor modulatory activity in cell-based assays. Apparently, the computational model intrinsically captured relevant chemical and biological knowledge without the need for explicit rules. The results of this study advocate generative artificial intelligence for prospective de novo molecular design, and demonstrate the potential of these methods for future medicinal chemistry.

J	Wen, L; Xie, XT; Li, XY; Gao, L				Wen, Long; Xie, Xiaotong; Li, Xinyu; Gao, Liang			A new ensemble convolutional neural network with diversity regularization for fault diagnosis	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Ensemble learning; Deep learning; Generalization ability	ROTATING MACHINERY; BEARINGS	Fault diagnosis is an essential technique to ensure the safety in modern industry. With the development of smart manufacturing, deep learning (DL) has been widely used to handle with massive mechanical data in fault diagnosis. However, the individual DL method suffers from the low generalization ability. In this research, a new improved snapshot ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (ISECNN) is proposed in order to obtain a stable and well-performed DL based fault diagnosis method. ISECNN applies the diversity regularization to generate several local minima and keeps their diversity during the training process, as the increasing of the diverse would promote the generalization ability of the group of local minima. Then, ISECNN combines all the local minima to form the ensemble method. The proposed ISECNN has been conducted on two famous bearing datasets. The prediction accuracy and the standard deviation are applied as the criterion. The experimental results show that ISECNN can increase the generalization ability without decreasing the prediction accuracy. ISECNN is also compared with traditional DL and machine learning methods, and the results validate the potential performance of ISECNN in the fault diagnosis field.

J	Ribeiro, MHD; da Silva, RG; Mariani, VC; Coelho, LD				Dal Molin Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique; da Silva, Ramon Gomes; Mariani, Viviana Cocco; Coelho, Leandro dos Santos			Short-term forecasting COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases: Perspectives for Brazil	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article						ARIMA; COVID-19; Forecasting; Decision-making; Machine learning; Time-series	REGRESSION	The new Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emerging disease responsible for infecting millions of people since the first notification until nowadays. Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow forecasting the number of future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three, and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking-ensemble learning approach, the CUBIST regression, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian process (GP) as meta-learner. The models' effectiveness is evaluated based on the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking-ensemble learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.87%-3.51%, 1.02%-5.63%, and 0.95%-6.90% in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models, from the best to the worst regarding accuracy, in all scenarios is SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models. The use of evaluated models is recommended to forecasting and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems.

Using the IoT, physical objects can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange data in a seamless manner. Various IoT applications focus on automating different tasks and are trying to empower the inanimate physical objects to act without any human intervention. The existing and upcoming IoT applications are highly promising to increase the level of comfort, efficiency, and automation for the users. To be able to implement such a world in an evergrowing fashion requires high security, privacy, authentication, and recovery from attacks. In this regard, it is imperative to make the required changes in the architecture of the IoT applications for achieving end-to-end secure IoT environments. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related challenges and sources of threat in the IoT applications is presented. After discussing the security issues, various emerging and existing technologies focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the IoT applications are discussed. Four different technologies, blockchain, fog computing, edge computing, and machine learning, to increase the level of security in IoT are discussed.

Existing heterogeneous domain adaptation research is relatively well-progressed but only in situations where the target domain contains at least a few labeled instances. In contrast, heterogeneous domain adaptation with an unlabeled target domain has not been well-studied. To contribute to the research in this emerging field, this article presents: 1) an unsupervised knowledge transfer theorem that guarantees the correctness of transferring knowledge and 2) a principal angle-based metric to measure the distance between two pairs of domains: one pair comprises the original source and target domains and the other pair comprises two homogeneous representations of two domains. The theorem and the metric have been implemented in an innovative transfer model, called a Grassmann-linear monotonic maps-geodesic flow kernel (GLG), which is specifically designed for heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation (HeUDA). The linear monotonic maps (LMMs) meet the conditions of the theorem and are used to construct homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous domains. The metric shows the extent to which the homogeneous representations have preserved the information in the original source and target domains. By minimizing the proposed metric, the GLG model learns the homogeneous representations of heterogeneous domains and transfers knowledge through these learned representations via a geodesic flow kernel (GFK). To evaluate the model, five public data sets were reorganized into ten HeUDA tasks across three applications: cancer detection, the credit assessment, and text classification. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model delivers superior performance over the existing baselines.

Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains. Tree-based machine learning models are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance and public services. The authors present an explanation method for trees that enables the computation of optimal local explanations for individual predictions, and demonstrate their method on three medical datasets.

The purpose of M4 was to replicate the results of the previous ones and extend them into three directions: First significantly increase the number of series, second include Machine Learning (ML) forecasting methods, and third evaluate both point forecasts and prediction intervals. The five major findings of the M4 Competitions are: 1. Out Of the 17 most accurate methods, 12 were "combinations" of mostly statistical approaches. 2. The biggest surprise was a "hybrid" approach that utilized both statistical and ML features. This method's average sMAPE was close to 10% more accurate than the combination benchmark used to compare the submitted methods. 3. The second most accurate method was a combination of seven statistical methods and one ML one, with the weights for the averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm that was trained to minimize the forecasting. 4. The two most accurate methods also achieved an amazing success in specifying the 95% prediction intervals correctly. 5. The six pure ML methods performed poorly, with none of them being more accurate than the combination benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naive2. This paper presents some initial results of M4, its major findings and a logical conclusion. Finally, it outlines what the authors consider to be the way forward for the field of forecasting.

Learning Backtrackless Aligned-Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks for Graph Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Convolution; Adaptation models; Transforms; Convolutional neural networks; Standards; Feature extraction; Kernel; Graph convolutional networks; transitive vertex alignment; backtrackless walk		In this paper, we develop a novel backtrackless aligned-spatial graph convolutional network (BASGCN) model to learn effective features for graph classification. Our idea is to transform arbitrary-sized graphs into fixed-sized backtrackless aligned grid structures and define a new spatial graph convolution operation associated with the grid structures. We show that the proposed BASGCN model not only reduces the problems of information loss and imprecise information representation arising in existing spatially-based graph convolutional network (GCN) models, but also bridges the theoretical gap between traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) models and spatially-based GCN models. Furthermore, the proposed BASGCN model can both adaptively discriminate the importance between specified vertices during the convolution process and reduce the notorious tottering problem of existing spatially-based GCNs related to the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm, explaining the effectiveness of the proposed model. Experiments on standard graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Mechanoreceptor networks that provide sensory feedback and enable the dexterity of the human grasp(2) remain difficult to replicate in robots. Whereas computer-vision-based robot grasping strategies(3-5) have progressed substantially with the abundance of visual data and emerging machine-learning tools, there are as yet no equivalent sensing platforms and large-scale datasets with which to probe the use of the tactile information that humans rely on when grasping objects. Studying the mechanics of how humans grasp objects will complement vision-based robotic object handling. Importantly, the inability to record and analyse tactile signals currently limits our understanding of the role of tactile information in the human grasp itself-for example, how tactile maps are used to identify objects and infer their properties is unknown(6). Here we use a scalable tactile glove and deep convolutional neural networks to show that sensors uniformly distributed over the hand can be used to identify individual objects, estimate their weight and explore the typical tactile patterns that emerge while grasping objects. The sensor array (548 sensors) is assembled on a knitted glove, and consists of a piezoresistive film connected by a network of conductive thread electrodes that are passively probed. Using a low-cost (about US$10) scalable tactile glove sensor array, we record a large-scale tactile dataset with 135,000 frames, each covering the full hand, while interacting with 26 different objects. This set of interactions with different objects reveals the key correspondences between different regions of a human hand while it is manipulating objects. Insights from the tactile signatures of the human grasp-through the lens of an artificial analogue of the natural mechanoreceptor network-can thus aid the future design of prosthetics(7), robot grasping tools and human-robot interactions(1,8-10).

We introduce a new method to perform accurate SOC estimation for Li-ion batteries using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM). We showcase the LSTM-RNN's ability to encode dependencies in time and accurately estimate SOC without using any battery models, filters, or inference systems like Kalman filters. In addition, this machine-learning technique, like all others, is capable of generalizing the abstractions it learns during training to other datasets taken under different conditions. Therefore, we exploit this feature by training an LSTM-RNN model over datasets recorded at various ambient temperatures, leading to a single network that can properly estimate SOC at different ambient temperature conditions. The LSTM-RNN achieves a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.573% at a fixed ambient temperature and an MAE of 1.606% on a dataset with ambient temperature increasing from 10 to 25 degrees C.

Genetic variants impacting splicing underlie a substantial proportion of genetic disease, but are challenging to identify beyond those occurring at donor and acceptor dinucleotides. To address this, various methods aim to predict variant effects on splicing. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve better results in predicting splice variants than other strategies.MethodsIt has been unclear how best to integrate such process-specific scores into genome-wide variant effect predictors. Here, we use a recently published experimental data set to compare several machine learning methods that score variant effects on splicing. We integrate the best of those approaches into general variant effect prediction models and observe the effect on classification of known pathogenic variants.ResultsWe integrate two specialized splicing scores into CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion; cadd.gs.washington.edu), a widely used tool for genome-wide variant effect prediction that we previously developed to weight and integrate diverse collections of genomic annotations. With this new model, CADD-Splice, we show that inclusion of splicing DNN effect scores substantially improves predictions across multiple variant categories, without compromising overall performance.ConclusionsWhile splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, specialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as the latter account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. Although only shown here for splice scores, we believe that the applied approach will generalize to other specific molecular processes, providing a path for the further improvement of genome-wide variant effect prediction.

Detecting Activities of Daily Living and Routine Behaviours in Dementia Patients Living Alone Using Smart Meter Load Disaggregation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTING			English	Article						Smart meters; Monitoring; Intelligent sensors; Dementia; Smart grids; Smart meter and smart grid; data science and analytics; remote monitoring and machine learning; assisted living	LOCALIZATION	The emergence of an ageing population is a significant public health concern. This has led to an increase in the number of people living with progressive neurodegenerative disorders. The strain this places on services means providing 24-hour monitoring is not sustainable. No solution exists to non-intrusively monitor the wellbeing of patients with dementia, resulting in delayed intervention. Using machine learning and signal processing, domestic energy supplies can be disaggregated to detect appliance usage. This enables Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) to be assessed. The aim is to facilitate early intervention and enable patients to stay in their homes for longer. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Decision Forest classifier are modelled using data from three test homes. The trained models are then used to monitor two patients with dementia during a six-month clinical trial undertaken in partnership with Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust. In the case of load disaggregation, the SVM achieved (AUC = 0.86074, Sen = 0.756 and Spec = 0.92838). While the Decision Forest achieved (AUC = 0.9429, Sen = 0.9634 and Spec = 0.9634). ADLs are also analysed to identify the behavioural patterns of the occupant while detecting alterations in routine. The approach is sensitive in identifying behavioural routines and detecting anomalies in patient behaviour.	[Chalmers, C.; Fergus, P.; Montanez, C.

Specifically, I-IoT is devoted to adopting the IoT to enable the interconnection of anything, anywhere, and at any time in the manufacturing system context to improve the productivity, efficiency, safety, and intelligence. As an emerging technology, I-IoT has distinct properties and requirements that distinguish it from consumer IoT, including the unique types of smart devices incorporated, network technologies and quality-of-service requirements, and strict needs of command and control. To more clearly understand the complexities of I-IoT and its distinct needs and to present a unified assessment of the technology from a systems' perspective, in this paper, we comprehensively survey the body of existing research on I-IoT. Particularly, we first present the I-IoT architecture, I-IoT applications (i.e., factory automation and process automation), and their characteristics. We then consider existing research efforts from the three key system aspects of control, networking, and computing. Regarding control, we first categorize industrial control systems and then present recent and relevant research efforts. Next, considering networking, we propose a three-dimensional framework to explore the existing research space and investigate the adoption of some representative networking technologies, including 5G, machine-to-machine communication, and software-defined networking. Similarly, concerning computing, we again propose a second three-dimensional framework that explores the problem space of computing in I-IoT and investigate the cloud, edge, and hybrid cloud and edge computing platforms. Finally, we outline particular challenges and future research needs in control, networking, and computing systems, as well as for the adoption of machine learning in an I-IoT context.

It can generate a large number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) for device authentication based on process variations. However, attackers can collect the CRPs to build a machine learning (ML) model with high prediction accuracy for the PUF. Recently, a lot of ML-resistant PUF structures have been proposed, e.g., a multiplexer-based PUF (MPUF) was introduced to resist ML attacks and its two variants (rMPUF and cMPUF) were further proposed to resist reliability-based and cryptanalysis modeling attacks, respectively. In this article, we propose a general framework for ML attacks on strong PUFs, then based on the framework, we present two novel modeling attacks, named logical approximation and global approximation, that use artificial neural network (ANN) to characterize the nonlinear structure of MPUF, rMPUF, cMPUF, and XOR Arbiter PUF. The logical approximation method uses linear functions to approximate logical operations and builds a precise soft model based on the combination of logical gates in the PUF. The global approximation method uses the function sinc with filtering characteristics to fit the mapping relationship between the challenge and response. The experimental results show that the proposed two approximation attacks can successfully model the (n, k)-MPUF (k = 3, 4), (n, k)-rMPUF (k = 2, 3), cMPUF (k = 4, 5), and l-XOR Arbiter PUF (l = 3, 4, 5) (n = 32, 64) with the average accuracies of 96.85%, 95.33%, 94.52%, and 96.26%, respectively.

The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F-1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F-1 score.

A Cubesat enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) utilizing Planet, Landsat and MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						CubeSat; Planet; Landsat; MODIS; Cubist; Machine-learning; VNIR; Spatio-temporal enhancement	LEAF-AREA INDEX; CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT; VEGETATION INDEXES; RADIOMETRIC NORMALIZATION; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; CANOPY REFLECTANCE; EARTH OBSERVATION; RANDOM FORESTS; SATELLITE; RESOLUTION	Satellite sensing in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) domain has been the backbone of land surface monitoring and characterization for more than four decades. However, a limitation of conventional single-sensor satellite missions is their limited capacity to observe land surface dynamics at the very high spatial and temporal resolutions demanded by a wide range of applications. One solution to this spatio-temporal divide is an observation strategy based on the CubeSat standard, which facilitates constellations of small, inexpensive satellites. Repeatable near-daily image capture in RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3-4 m resolution has recently become available via a constellation of > 130 CubeSats operated commercially by Planet. While the observing capacity afforded by this system is unprecedented, the relatively low radiometric quality and cross-sensor inconsistencies represent key challenges in the realization of their full potential as a game changer in Earth observation. To address this issue, we developed a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) that uses a multi-scale machine-learning technique to correct for radiometric inconsistencies between CubeSat acquisitions. The CESTEM produces Landsat 8 consistent atmospherically corrected surface reflectances in blue, green, red, and NIR bands, but at the spatial scale and temporal frequency of the CubeSat observations. An application of CESTEM over an agricultural dryland system in Saudi Arabia demonstrated CubeSat-based reproduction of Landsat 8 consistent VNIR data with an overall relative mean absolute deviation of 1.6% or better, even when the Landsat 8 and CubeSat acquisitions were temporally displaced by > 32 days. The consistently high retrieval accuracies were achieved using a multi-scale target sampling scheme that draws Landsat 8 reference data from a series of scenes by using MODIS-consistent surface reflectance time series to quantify relative changes in Landsat-scale reflectances over given Landsat-CubeSat acquisition timespans. With the observing potential of Planet's CubeSats approaching daily nadir-pointing land surface imaging of the entire Earth, CESTEM offers the capacity to produce daily Landsat 8 consistent VNIR imagery with a factor of 10 increase in spatial resolution and with the radiometric quality of actual Landsat 8 observations. Realization of this unprecedented Earth observing capacity has far reaching implications for the monitoring and characterization of terrestrial systems at the precision scale.

From a social point of view, it is extremely important to prevent heart diseases, which are the most common cause of death worldwide. According to statistical data, 50 million people are at risk for cardiac diseases worldwide. The subject of ECG signal analysis is very popular. However, due to the great difficulty of the task undertaken, and high computational complexity of existing methods, there remains substantial work to perform. This research collected 1000 fragments of ECG signals from the MIH-BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead, MLII, from 45 patients. An original methodology that consisted of the analysis of longer (10-s) fragments of the ECG signal was used (an average of 13 times less classifications). To enhance the characteristic features of the ECG signal, the spectral power density was estimated (using Welch's method and a discrete Fourier transform). Genetic optimization of parameters and genetic selection of features were tested. Pre-processing, normalization, feature extraction and selection, cross-validation and machine learning algorithms (SVM, kNN, PNN, and RBFNN) were used. The best evolutionary-neural system, based on the SVM classifier, obtained a recognition sensitivity of 17 myocardium dysfunctions at a level of 90.20% (98 errors per 1000 classifications, accuracy = 98.85%, specificity = 99.39%, time for classification of one sample = 0.0023 [s]). Against the background of the current scientific literature, these results are some of the best results to date. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Is multi-hazard mapping effective in assessing natural hazards and integrated watershed management?

However, there is a great need to examine hazards holistically to better manage the complex of threats found in any region. Many regions of the world have complex hazard landscapes wherein risk from individual and/or multiple extreme events is omnipresent. Extensive parts of Iran experience a complex array of natural hazards - floods, earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, subsidence, and drought. The effectiveness of risk mitigation is in part a function of whether the complex of hazards can be collectively considered, visualized, and evaluated. This study develops and tests individual and collective multihazard risk maps for floods, landslides, and forest fires to visualize the spatial distribution of risk in Fars Province, southern Iran. To do this, two well-known machine-learning algorithms - SVM and MARS - are used to predict the distribution of these events. Past floods, landslides, and forest fires were surveyed and mapped. The locations of occurrence of these events (individually and collectively) were randomly separated into training (70%) and testing (30%) data sets. The conditioning factors (for floods, landslides, and forest fires) employed to model the risk distributions are aspect, elevation, drainage density, distance from faults, geology, LULC, profile curvature, annual mean rainfall, plan curvature, distance from man-made residential structures, distance from nearest river, distance from nearest road, slope gradient, soil types, mean annual temperature, and TWI. The outputs of the two models were assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, true-skill statistics (TSS), and the correlation and deviance values from each models for each hazard. The areas-under-the-curves (AUC) for the MARS model prediction were 76.0%, 91.2%, and 90.1% for floods, landslides, and forest fires, respectively. Similarly, the AUCs for the SVM model were 75.5%, 89.0%, and 91.5%. The TSS reveals that the MARS model was better able to predict landslide risk, but was less able to predict flood-risk patterns and forest-fire risk. Finally, the combination of flood, forest fire, and landslide risk maps yielded a multi-hazard susceptibility map for the province. The better predictive model indicated that 52.3% of the province was at-risk for at least one of these hazards. This multi-hazard map may yield valuable insight for land-use planning, sustainable development of infrastructure, and also integrated watershed management in Fars Province.

Raman chemical maps contain a plethora of information about the spatial distribution and the particle size of the components, compression force and even polymorphism. With proper data analysis techniques, this can be converted into simple numerical information which can be used as input in a machine learning model. In our work, sustained-release tablets using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as matrix polymer are prepared, the concentration and particle size of this component varied between samples. Chemical maps of HPMC are converted into histograms with two different methods, an approach based on discretizing concentration values and a wavelet analysis technique. These histograms are then subjected to Principal Component Analysis, the score value of the first two principal components was found to represent HPMC content and particle size. These values are used as input in Artificial Neural Networks which are trained to predict the dissolution profile of the tablets. As a result, accurate predictions were obtained for the test tablets (the average f(2) similarity value is higher than 59 with both methods). The presented methodology lays the foundations of the analysis of far more extensive datasets acquired with the emerging fast Raman imaging technology.

TSC is the area of machine learning tasked with the categorization (or labelling) of time series. The last fewdecades ofwork in this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE cannot be applied to many real-world datasets because of its high training time complexity in O(N-2 center dot T-4) for a dataset with N time series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 8 days to learn from a small dataset with N = 1500 time series of short length T = 46. Meanwhile deep learning has received enormous attention because of its high accuracy and scalability. Recent approaches to deep learning for TSC have been scalable, but less accurate than HIVE-COTE. We introduce InceptionTime-an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime is on par with HIVE-COTE in terms of accuracy while being much more scalable: not only can it learn from 1500 time series in one hour but it can also learn from 8M time series in 13 h, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to validate the feasibility of a single transition metal (TM) embedded in defective g-C3N4 for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. It was clarified that the TM atom supported on defective g-C3N4 with N vacancy (TM/VN-CN) was stable and possible to be synthesized. Remarkably, Rh/V-N-CN exhibited low overpotentials of 0.32 and 0.43 V for OER and ORR, respectively, and was considered as the promising bifunctional catalyst. The volcano plots and contour maps were established based on the scaling relation of adsorption energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH. The OER/ORR activity origin was revealed by descriptors of the d-band center and the number of d-orbital electrons multiplied electronegativity of TM. Furthermore, the machine learning (ML) algorithm was utilized to analyze the intrinsic correlation between catalytic activity and a series of structural and atomic features. Our combined DFT and ML work not only opts for the promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts but also provides guidance for the design of single-atom catalysts and the discovery of more efficient catalysts.

A systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Class imbalance; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification	NOVELTY DETECTION APPROACH; CLASSIFICATION; SMOTE; CLASSIFIERS	In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and compare frequently used methods to address the issue. Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.

J	Kattenborn, T; Leitloff, J; Schiefer, F; Hinz, S				Kattenborn, Teja; Leitloff, Jens; Schiefer, Felix; Hinz, Stefan			Review on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in vegetation remote sensing	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Review						Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Deep learning; Vegetation; Plants; Remote sensing; Earth observation	TREE SPECIES CLASSIFICATION; LAND-COVER; HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CONIFER FOREST; DEEP; SEGMENTATION; BENCHMARK; MACHINE; MODEL	Identifying and characterizing vascular plants in time and space is required in various disciplines, e.g. in forestry, conservation and agriculture. Remote sensing emerged as a key technology revealing both spatial and temporal vegetation patterns. Harnessing the ever growing streams of remote sensing data for the increasing demands on vegetation assessments and monitoring requires efficient, accurate and flexible methods for data analysis. In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of CNN and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as CNN approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that CNN can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that CNN outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of CNN to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architectures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by CNNs will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although CNN has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing.

However, few studies fully investigated ensembles of artificial neural networks. In this work, we investigated multiple widely used ensemble methods, including unweighted averaging, majority voting, the Bayes Optimal Classifier, and the (discrete) Super Learner, for image recognition tasks, with deep neural networks as candidate algorithms. We designed several experiments, with the candidate algorithms being the same network structure with different model checkpoints within a single training process, networks with same structure but trained multiple times stochastically, and networks with different structure. In addition, we further studied the overconfidence phenomenon of the neural networks, as well as its impact on the ensemble methods. Across all of our experiments, the Super Learner achieved best performance among all the ensemble methods in this study.

Six ensemble machine learning (EML) algorithms, such as random forest (RF), random subspace, dagging, bagging, naive Bayes tree (NBT), and stacking, coupled with fuzzy logic (FL) models and a ROC-based weighting approach have been used for creating hybrid models integrated GWP. The GWP was then verified using both parametric and nonparametric receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), such as the empirical ROC (eROC) and the binormal ROC curve (bROC). We conducted an RF-based sensitivity analysis to compute the relevancy of the conditioning variables for GWP modeling. The very high and high groundwater potential regions were predicted as 831-1200 km(2) and 521-680 km(2) areas based on six EML models. Based on the area under the curve of the ROC, the NBT (eROC: 0.892; bROC: 0.928) model outperforms rest of the models. Six GPMs were considered variables for the next step and turned into crisp fuzzy layers using the fuzzy membership function, and the ROC-based weighting approach. Subsequently four fuzzy logic operators were used to assimilate the crisp fuzzy layers, including AND, OR, GAMMA0.8, and GAMMA 0.9, as well as GAMMA0.9. Thus, we created four hybrid models using FL model. The results of the eROC and bROC curve showed that GAMMA 0.9 operator outperformed other fuzzy operators-based GPMs in terms of accuracy.

Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F-1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets.ResultsThe Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset.ConclusionsIn this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F-1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F-1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.

Therefore, RISs are considered a promising technology for the sixth-generation (6G) of communication networks. In this context, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art on RISs, with focus on their operating principles, performance evaluation, beamforming design and resource management, applications of machine learning to RIS-enhanced wireless networks, as well as the integration of RISs with other emerging technologies. We describe the basic principles of RISs both from physics and communications perspectives, based on which we present performance evaluation of multiantenna assisted RIS systems. In addition, we systematically survey existing designs for RIS-enhanced wireless networks encompassing performance analysis, information theory, and performance optimization perspectives. Furthermore, we survey existing research contributions that apply machine learning for tackling challenges in dynamic scenarios, such as random fluctuations of wireless channels and user mobility in RIS-enhanced wireless networks. Last but not least, we identify major issues and research opportunities associated with the integration of RISs and other emerging technologies for applications to next-generation networks.

We fabricate and characterize 75 unique perovskite-inspired compositions within a 2-month period, with 87% exhibiting band gaps between 1.2 and 2.4 eV, which are of interest for energy-harvesting applications. We utilize a fully connected deep neural network to classify compounds based on experimental X-ray diffraction data into 0D, 2D, and 3D structures, more than 10 times faster than human analysis and with 90% accuracy. We validate our methods using lead-halide perovskites and extend the application to lead-free compositions. The wider synthesis window and faster cycle of learning enables the realization of a multi-site lead-free alloy series, Cs-3(Bi1-xSbx)(2)(I1-xBrx)(9). We reveal the non-linear band-gap behavior and transition in dimensionality upon simultaneous alloying on the B-site and X-site of Cs3Bi2I9 with Sb and Br.	[Sun, Shijing; Hartono, Noor T.

Image features are primarily used as input to get answers. However, the image features are too redundant to learn accurate characterizations within a limited complexity and time. While in the process of human reasoning, abstract description of an image is usually to avoid irrelevant details. Inspired by this, a higher-level representation named semantic representation is introduced. In this paper, a detailed visual reasoning model is proposed. This new model contains an image understanding model based on semantic representation, feature extraction and process model refined with watershed and u-distance method, a feature vector learning model using pyramidal pooling and residual network, and a question understanding model combining problem embedding coding method and machine translation decoding method. The feature vector could better represent the whole image instead of overly focused on specific characteristics. The model using semantic representation as input verifies that more accurate results can be obtained by introducing a high-level semantic representation. The result also shows that it is feasible and effective to introduce high-level and abstract forms of knowledge representation into deep learning tasks. This study lays a theoretical and experimental foundation for introducing different levels of knowledge representation into deep learning in the future.

One of the most efficient ways to mitigate traffic congestion is through future traffic prediction. The research field of traffic prediction has evolved greatly ever since its inception in the late 70s. Earlier studies mainly use classical statistical models such as ARIMA and its variants. Recently, researchers have started to focus on machine learning models because of their power and flexibility. As theoretical and technological advances emerge, we enter the era of deep neural network, which gained popularity due to its sheer prediction power which can be attributed to the complex and deep structure. Despite the popularity of deep neural network models in the field of traffic prediction, literature surveys of such methods are rare. In this work, we present an up-to-date survey of deep neural network for traffic prediction. We will provide a detailed explanation of popular deep neural network architectures commonly used in the traffic flow prediction literatures, categorize and describe the literatures themselves, present an overview of the commonalities and differences among different works, and finally provide a discussion regarding the challenges and future directions for this field.

Computational prediction of DTIs can effectively complement experimental wet-lab techniques for the identification of DTIs, which are typically time- and resource-consuming. However, the performances of the current DTI prediction approaches suffer from a problem of low precision and high false-positive rate. In this study, we aim to develop a novel DTI prediction method for improving the prediction performance based on a cascade deep forest (CDF) model, named DTI-CDF, with multiple similarity-based features between drugs and the similarity-based features between target proteins extracted from the heterogeneous graph, which contains known DTIs. In the experiments, we built five replicates of 10-fold cross-validation under three different experimental settings of data sets, namely, corresponding DTI values of certain drugs (SD), targets (ST), or drug-target pairs (SP) in the training sets are missed but existed in the test sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach DTI-CDF achieves a significantly higher performance than that of the traditional ensemble learning-based methods such as random forest and XGBoost, deep neural network, and the state-of-the-art methods such as DDR. Furthermore, there are 1352 newly predicted DTIs which are proved to be correct by KEGG and DrugBank databases.

With merging a diverse set of discriminative appearance factors, the resulting CNN-based representation exhibits spatial-spectral context sensitivity that is essential for accurate pixel classification. The proposed method exploiting diverse region-based inputs to learn contextual interactional features is expected to have more discriminative power. The joint representation containing rich spectral and spatial information is then fed to a fully connected network and the label of each pixel vector is predicted by a softmax layer. Experimental results with widely used hyperspectral image data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can surpass any other conventional deep learning-based classifiers and other state-ofthe- art classifiers.

To achieve this, a model structure is first proposed with the considerations of battery aging tendency and the corresponding operational temperature and depth-of-discharge. Then based on a systematic understanding of the covariance functions within the Gaussian process regression (GPR), two related data-driven models are developed. Specifically, by modifying the isotropic squared exponential kernel with an automatic relevance determination structure, "Model A" could extract the highly relevant input features for capacity predictions. Through coupling the Arrhenius law and a polynomial equation into a compositional kernel, "Model B" is capable of considering the electrochemical and empirical knowledge of battery degradation. The developed models are validated and compared on the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) oxide Li-ion batteries with various cycling patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that the modified GPR model considering the battery electrochemical and empirical aging signature outperforms other counterparts and is able to achieve satisfactory results for both one-step and multistep predictions. The proposed technique is promising for battery capacity predictions under various cycling cases.

Deep learning algorithms can be used to develop effective forecasting models of ahead evapotranspiration. In this study, three Recurrent Neural Networkbased models were built for the prediction of short term ahead actual evapotranspiration. Two variants of each model were developed changing the employed algorithm, selecting between long short-term memory (LSTM) and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX), while the modeling was performed in the context of an ensemble approach. The prediction models were trained and tested using data from two sites with different climates: Cypress Swamp, southern Florida, and Kobeh Valley, central Nevada. With reference to the subtropical climatic conditions of South Florida, LSTM models proved to be more accurate than NARX models, while some exogenous variables such as sensible heat flux and relative humidity did not affect the results significantly. An increase of the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days resulted in a slight reduction in the accuracy of both the LSTM- and NARX based models. Considering instead the semi-arid climate of Central Nevada, NARX models generally provided more accurate results, which were only slightly affected by relative humidity, sensible heat flux, and forecast horizon. On the other hand, LSTM models performance decayed if sensible heat flux and relative humidity were neglected, and if the forecast horizon was increased from 1 to 7 days. Deep learning-based models can provide very accurate predictions of actual evapotranspiration, but the performance of the models can be significantly affected by local climatic conditions.

However, openly accessible information at high spatial resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban contexts. We utilized information from the spectral/polarization, temporal and spatial dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied, as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height, but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results. When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust. The average building height varies considerably across Germany with lower buildings in Eastern and South-Eastern Germany and taller ones along the highly urbanized areas in Western Germany. We emphasize the straightforward applicability of this approach on the national scale. It mostly relies on freely available satellite imagery and open source software, which potentially permit frequent update cycles and cost-effective mapping that may be relevant for a plethora of different applications, e.g. physical analysis of structural features or mapping society's resource usage.

Starting from the issues of the MEMS fabrication, we introduced typical MEMS sensors for their applications in the Internet of Things (IoTs), such as MEMS physical sensor, MEMS acoustic sensor, and MEMS gas sensor. Toward the trends in intelligence and less power consumption, MEMS components including MEMS/NEMS switch, piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT), and MEMS energy harvesting were investigated to assist the future sensors, such as event-based or almost zero-power. Furthermore, MEMS rigid substrate toward NEMS flexible-based for flexibility and interface was discussed as another important development trend for next-generation wearable or multi-functional sensors. Around the issues about the big data and human-machine realization for human beings' manipulation, artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technologies were finally realized using sensor nodes and its wave identification as future trends for various scenarios.

J	Zhang, JF; Zhu, Y; Zhang, XP; Ye, M; Yang, JZ				Zhang, Jianfeng; Zhu, Yan; Zhang, Xiaoping; Ye, Ming; Yang, Jinzhong			Developing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model for predicting water table depth in agricultural areas	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Machine-learning model; Water table depth; Deep learning; LSTM; Hetao Irrigation District	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; GROUNDWATER DYNAMICS; WAVELET; IMPACT; SERIES; FLOW; DECOMPOSITION; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT	Predicting water table depth over the long-term in agricultural areas presents great challenges because these areas have complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, boundary conditions, and human activities; also, nonlinear interactions occur among these factors. Therefore, a new time series model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models. The proposed model is composed of an LSTM layer with another fully connected layer on top of it, with a dropout method applied in the first LSTM layer. In this study, the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub-areas of Hetao Irrigation District in arid northwestern China using data of 14 years (2000-2013). The proposed model uses monthly water diversion, evaporation, precipitation, temperature, and time as input data to predict water table depth. A simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre-process data to ensure data on the same scale. 14 years of data are separated into two sets: training set (2000-2011) and validation set (2012-2013) in the experiment. As expected, the proposed model achieves higher R-2 scores (0.789-0.952) in water table depth prediction, when compared with the results of traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN), which only reaches relatively low R-2 scores (0.004-0.495), proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well. Furthermore, the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model's architecture are discussed. Through experimentation, the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly. In addition, comparisons between the R-2 scores of the proposed model and Double-LSTM model (R-2 scores range from 0.170 to 0.864), further prove that the proposed model's architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data. Thus, one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth, especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain.

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.

Recently, deep learning has become the mainstream methodological choice for analyzing and interpreting histology images. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that have been used in the context of histopathological image analysis. From the survey of over 130 papers, we review the field's progress based on the methodological aspect of different machine learning strategies such as supervised, weakly supervised, unsupervised, transfer learning and various other sub-variants of these methods. We also provide an overview of deep learning based survival models that are applicable for disease-specific prognosis tasks. Finally, we summarize several existing open datasets and highlight critical challenges and limitations with current deep learning approaches, along with possible avenues for future research.

The proposed solution employs a novel architecture consisting of wavelet transform and multiple long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. Experimental evaluations show superior ECG classification performance compared to previous works. Measurements on different hardware platforms show the proposed algorithm meets timing requirements for continuous and real-time execution on wearable devices. In contrast to many compute-intensive deep-learning based approaches, the proposed algorithm is lightweight, and therefore, brings continuous monitoring with accurate LSTM-based ECG classification to wearable devices. The proposed algorithm is both accurate and lightweight. The source code is available online at http://lis.ee.sharif.edu.

J	Luo, YW; Ren, CX; Dai, DQ; Yan, H				Luo, You-Wei; Ren, Chuan-Xian; Dai, Dao-Qing; Yan, Hong			Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Discriminative Manifold Propagation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Manifolds; Machine learning; Measurement; Training; Prototypes; Task analysis; Dictionaries; Unsupervised domain adaptation; riemannian manifold; discriminant embedding; manifold alignment	ALGORITHMS; FRAMEWORK	Unsupervised domain adaptation is effective in leveraging rich information from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Though deep learning and adversarial strategy made a significant breakthrough in the adaptability of features, there are two issues to be further studied. First, hard-assigned pseudo labels on the target domain are arbitrary and error-prone, and direct application of them may destroy the intrinsic data structure. Second, batch-wise training of deep learning limits the characterization of the global structure. In this paper, a Riemannian manifold learning framework is proposed to achieve transferability and discriminability simultaneously. For the first issue, this framework establishes a probabilistic discriminant criterion on the target domain via soft labels. Based on pre-built prototypes, this criterion is extended to a global approximation scheme for the second issue. Manifold metric alignment is adopted to be compatible with the embedding space. The theoretical error bounds of different alignment metrics are derived for constructive guidance. The proposed method can be used to tackle a series of variants of domain adaptation problems, including both vanilla and partial settings. Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the method and a comparative study shows the superiority of the discriminative manifold learning framework.

However, while user provided photos embedded in online reviews accumulate in large quantities, their informational value has not been well understood likely due to technical challenges. The goal of this study is to introduce deep learning for computer vision to understand information value of online hotel reviews. Using a dataset collected from two social media sites, we compared deep learning models with other machine learning techniques to examine the effect of user-provided photos on review helpfulness. Findings show that deep learning models were more useful in predicting review helpfulness than other models. While user-provided photos alone did not have the same impact as review texts, combining review texts and user-provided photos produced the highest performance. Implications for the applications of deep learning technologies in hospitality and tourism research, as well as limitations and directions for future research, are discussed.

However, in many real world applications, these assumptions may not hold as the amount of previously available data may be insufficient to represent the underlying system, and the environment and the system may change over time. As the amount of data increases, it is no longer feasible to process data efficiently using iterative algorithms, which typically require multiple passes over the same portions of data. Evolving modeling from data streams has emerged as a framework to address these issues properly by self-adaptation, single-pass learning steps and evolution as well as contraction of model components on demand and on the fly. This survey focuses on evolving fuzzy rule-based models and neuro-fuzzy networks for clustering, classification and regression and system identification in online, real-time environments where learning and model development should be performed incrementally.

Service Research Priorities: Managing and Delivering Service in Turbulent Times	JOURNAL OF SERVICE RESEARCH			English	Article						service research priorities; stakeholders; transformative service research; customer experience; frontline service employees; customer proactivity; service operations; service technology; machine learning	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; CHANGING-ROLE; EXPERIENCE; FUTURE; WORK; FRONTLINES; CONSUMERS; AUTONOMY; CREATION; ROBOTS	Transformative changes in the societal and service context call out for the service discipline to develop a coherent set of priorities for research and practice. To this end, we utilized multiple data sources: surveys of service scholars and practitioners, web scraping of online documents, a review of published service scholarship, and roundtable discussions conducted at the world's foremost service research centers. We incorporated innovative methodologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and qualitative analyses, to identify key service research priorities that are critical to address during these turbulent times. The first two priorities-technology and the changing nature of work and technology and the customer experience-focus on leveraging technology for service provision and consumption. The next two priorities-resource and capability constraints and customer proactivity for well-being-focus on responding to the changing needs of multiple stakeholders. Further, we identified a set of stakeholder-wants from the literature and include research questions that tie key stakeholder-wants to each of the four priorities. We believe the set of research priorities in the present article offer actionable ideas for service research directions in this challenging environment.

J	Ijaz, MF; Attique, M; Son, Y				Ijaz, Muhammad Fazal; Attique, Muhammad; Son, Youngdoo			Data-Driven Cervical Cancer Prediction Model with Outlier Detection and Over-Sampling Methods	SENSORS			English	Article						cancer; artificial intelligence; digital health; machine learning; medical information systems; cervical cancer; imbalanced data analysis; outlier detection	DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MRI; FEATURE-SELECTION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; RISK; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; CYTOLOGY; SMOTE	Globally, cervical cancer remains as the foremost prevailing cancer in females. Hence, it is necessary to distinguish the importance of risk factors of cervical cancer to classify potential patients. The present work proposes a cervical cancer prediction model (CCPM) that offers early prediction of cervical cancer using risk factors as inputs. The CCPM first removes outliers by using outlier detection methods such as density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and isolation forest (iForest) and by increasing the number of cases in the dataset in a balanced way, for example, through synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and SMOTE with Tomek link (SMOTETomek). Finally, it employs random forest (RF) as a classifier. Thus, CCPM lies on four scenarios: (1) DBSCAN + SMOTETomek + RF, (2) DBSCAN + SMOTE+ RF, (3) iForest + SMOTETomek + RF, and (4) iForest + SMOTE + RF. A dataset of 858 potential patients was used to validate the performance of the proposed method. We found that combinations of iForest with SMOTE and iForest with SMOTETomek provided better performances than those of DBSCAN with SMOTE and DBSCAN with SMOTETomek. We also observed that RF performed the best among several popular machine learning classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed CCPM showed better accuracy than previously proposed methods for forecasting cervical cancer. In addition, a mobile application that can collect cervical cancer risk factors data and provides results from CCPM is developed for instant and proper action at the initial stage of cervical cancer.

However, certain SCMs are unable to meet the growing demand of construction sector. The presented study investigates the role of bentonite clay (BC) and its synergistic effect with silica fume (SF) as partial replacement of cement on strength, durability, and microstructure of concrete. Five different mixtures were prepared containing 0%, 7.5%, 15% and 22.5% (by weight) of BC as a replacement of cement whereas SF was kept constant at 10% replacement level. The experimental results showed that the addition of SF had a positive impact on compressive strength with increase in curing time i.e., a maximum value of 43.09 MPa was achieved. The bentonite based concrete requires excess curing to achieve high strength. The ultrasonic pulse velocity of all tested specimen lies in the range of "good" quality concrete i.e., > 3.5 km/s. Durability testing depicted that the BC and SF significantly improved the pore structures and resistance against sulfate attack and chloride ingress. The proposed empirical formulations (using machine learning technique i.e., gene expression programming) were found accurate (correlation>0.9) and can be utilized for prediction of properties of concrete. The environmental impact analysis revealed that utilization of BC and SF can reduce the carbon emission by approximately 23% compared to control mix. It is recommended to conduct leachate analysis for each mixture prior to use. The proposed concrete mixtures were deemed technically, environmentally, and economically viable for application in construction sector.

However, due to the existence of scaling relations for the adsorption of reaction intermediates, there is a long established trade-off between the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, as the enhancement of catalytic activity is typically accompanied by a four-electron O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), leading to the reduced selectivity for the H2O2 production. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we reported the feasibility of several classes of important and representative experimentally achievable single-atom catalysts (SACs) toward two-electron ORR, paying attention to their stability, selectivity, and activity at the acidic medium. Starting from 210 two-dimensional (2D) SACs, we demonstrated that 31 SACs have the potential to break the metal-based scaling relations and simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity toward H2O2 production and screened out 7 SACs with higher activity than the PtHg4 in acidic media. Especially, a noble metal-free SAC, namely, a single Zn atom centered phthalocyanine (Zn@Pc-N-4), has a remarkable activity improvement with a small overpotential of 0.15 V. Moreover, using multivariable analysis and machine-learning techniques, we provided a comprehensive understanding of the underlying origin of the selectivity and activity of SACs and unveiled the intrinsic correlations between structure and catalytic performance. This work may pave a way to the design and discovery of more promising materials for H2O2 production.

Toward a Quantitative Survey of Dimension Reduction Techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Benchmark testing; Data visualization; Machine learning; Scalability; Extraterrestrial measurements; Taxonomy; Dimensionality reduction; quality metrics; benchmarking; quantitative analysis; design space		Dimensionality reduction methods, also known as projections, are frequently used in multidimensional data exploration in machine learning, data science, and information visualization. Tens of such techniques have been proposed, aiming to address a wide set of requirements, such as ability to show the high-dimensional data structure, distance or neighborhood preservation, computational scalability, stability to data noise and/or outliers, and practical ease of use. However, it is far from clear for practitioners how to choose the best technique for a given use context. We present a survey of a wide body of projection techniques that helps answering this question. For this, we characterize the input data space, projection techniques, and the quality of projections, by several quantitative metrics. We sample these three spaces according to these metrics, aiming at good coverage with bounded effort. We describe our measurements and outline observed dependencies of the measured variables. Based on these results, we draw several conclusions that help comparing projection techniques, explain their results for different types of data, and ultimately help practitioners when choosing a projection for a given context. Our methodology, datasets, projection implementations, metrics, visualizations, and results are publicly open, so interested stakeholders can examine and/or extend this benchmark.

Many conventional computational methods for identifying N-6-methyladenosine sites are limited by the small amount of data available. Taking advantage of the thousands of m(6)A sites detected by high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to discover the characteristics of m(6)A sequences using deep learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to use word embedding and deep neural networks for m(6)A prediction from mRNA sequences. Using four deep neural networks, we developed a model inferred from a larger sequence shifting window that can predict m(6)A accurately and robustly. Four prediction schemes were built with various RNA sequence representations and optimized convolutional neural networks. The soft voting results from the four deep networks were shown to outperform all of the state-of-the-art methods. We evaluated these predictors mentioned above on a rigorous independent test data set and proved that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors. The training, independent, and cross-species testing data sets are much larger than in previous studies, which could help to avoid the problem of overfitting.

Soil moisture products provided by passive microwave remote sensing possess coarse spatial resolutions ranging from 25 to 50 km, unable to reflect large spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture caused by complex interactions among meteorological forcing, land cover, and topography. Meanwhile, active microwave remote sensing can provide higher spatial resolution than passive sensors that may reach 1 km but with lower temporal resolution of 6-12 days (e.g., Sentinel-1). Better water resources management, particularly for the agricultural sector, requires spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimates at the field scale (e.g., 30 m x 30 m) to reflect its high spatiotemporal variability across heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, both data fusion and random forest models along with a range of remote sensing, reanalysis, and in situ data were jointly used to generate spatiotemporally continuous surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m x 30 m. First, both daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo at 30 m x 30 m were generated by fusing reflectance products of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat. Second, China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) land surface temperature (LST) was fused with both MODIS LST and Landsat LST to generate spatially complete LST maps (at 11 a.m. local solar time for each day) at 30 m x 30 m. Last, random forest models were developed to generate spatiotemporally continuous SSM of 30 m x 30 m using the fused variables at fine spatial resolution (e. g., NDVI, surface albedo, and LST), SSM background fields, and ancillary variables such as precipitation and soil texture as the model inputs. Compared with original SSM of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Version 4.4 SSM, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 SSM, and CLDAS SSM, the downscaled SSM using these products as background fields was improved significantly in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. Moreover, the integration of multiple SSM background fields improved the performance of the downscaled SSM significantly in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and accuracy compared with that using a single SSM background field. Overall, the downscaled SMAP_L4 + CLDAS SSM showed the best performance at four sites (i.e., Weishan, Huailai, Hujiatan, and Paihuai) out of seven sites on the North China Plain with R, bias, MAE, RMSE, and ubRMSE ranging from 0.70-0.84, -0.034-0.012 cm (3)/cm(3), 0.025-0.044 cm(3)/cm(3), 0.031-0.050 cm(3)/cm(3), and 0.022-0.042 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed framework maximizes the potential of data fusion, random forest models, and in situ data in deriving spatiotemporally continuous SSM estimates at 30 m x 30 m, which should be valuable for water resources management at the field scale.

A more realistic scenario is open set recognition (OSR), where incomplete knowledge of the world exists at training time, and unknown classes can be submitted to an algorithm during testing, requiring the classifiers to not only accurately classify the seen classes, but also effectively deal with unseen ones. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of existing open set recognition techniques covering various aspects ranging from related definitions, representations of models, datasets, evaluation criteria, and algorithm comparisons. Furthermore, we briefly analyze the relationships between OSR and its related tasks including zero-shot, one-shot (few-shot) recognition/learning techniques, classification with reject option, and so forth. Additionally, we also review the open world recognition which can be seen as a natural extension of OSR. Importantly, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and point out some promising subsequent research directions in this field.

This strategy breaks down when the number of categories grows, as it creates high-dimensional feature vectors. Additionally, for string entries, one-hot encoding does not capture morphological information in their representation. Here, we seek low-dimensional encoding of high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be: scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string categories: a Gamma-Poisson matrix factorizationon substring counts, and a min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to learn. Both approaches are scalable and streamable. Experiments on real and simulated data show that these methods improve supervised learning with high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: if scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models enable autoML on string entries as they remove the need for feature engineering or data cleaning.

The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission providing a systematic 5-day revisit cycle and free data access opens a completely new avenue for near real-time crop specific monitoring at parcel level over large countries. This research investigated the feasibility to propose methods and to develop an open source system able to generate, at national scale, cloud-free composites, dynamic cropland masks, crop type maps and vegetation status indicators suitable for most cropping systems. The so-called Sen2-Agri system automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series in a seamless way to derive these four products, thanks to streamlined processes based on machine learning algorithms and quality controlled in situ data. It embeds a set of key principles proposed to address the new challenges arising from countrywide 10 m resolution agriculture monitoring. The full-scale demonstration of this system for three entire countries (Ukraine, Mali, South Africa) and five local sites distributed across the world was a major challenge met successfully despite the availability of only one Sentinel-2 satellite in orbit. In situ data were collected for calibration and validation in a timely manner allowing the production of the four Sen2-Agri products over all the demonstration sites. The independent validation of the monthly cropland masks provided for most sites overall accuracy values higher than 90%, and already higher than 80% as early as the mid-season. The crop type maps depicting the 5 main crops for the considered study sites were also successfully validated: overall accuracy values higher than 80% and F1 Scores of the different crop type classes were most often higher than 0.65. These respective results pave the way for countrywide crop specific monitoring system at parcel level bridging the gap between parcel visits and national scale assessment. These full-scale demonstration results clearly highlight the operational agriculture monitoring capacity of the Sen2-Agri system to exploit in near real-time the observation acquired by the Sentinel-2 mission over very large areas. Scaling this open source system on cloud computing infrastructure becomes instrumental to support market transparency while building national monitoring capacity as requested by the AMIS and GEOGLAM G-20 initiatives.

In particular, we solve the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, which has smooth solutions, the nonlinear Burgers equation, which can admit high gradient solutions, and the Helmholtz equation. We introduce a scalable hyper-parameter in the activation function, which can be optimized to achieve best performance of the network as it changes dynamically the topology of the loss function involved in the optimization process. The adaptive activation function has better learning capabilities than the traditional one (fixed activation) as it improves greatly the convergence rate, especially at early training, as well as the solution accuracy. To better understand the learning process, we plot the neural network solution in the frequency domain to examine how the network captures successively different frequency bands present in the solution. We consider both forward problems, where the approximate solutions are obtained, as well as inverse problems, where parameters involved in the governing equation are identified. Our simulation results show that the proposed method is a very simple and effective approach to increase the efficiency, robustness and accuracy of the neural network approximation of nonlinear functions as well as solutions of partial differential equations, especially for forward problems. We theoretically prove that in the proposed method, gradient descent algorithms are not attracted to suboptimal critical points or local minima. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive activation functions are shown to accelerate the minimization process of the loss values in standard deep learning benchmarks using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, MNIST, KMNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Semeion datasets with and without data augmentation.

Prediction of psychosis across protocols and risk cohorts using automated language analysis	WORLD PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Automated language analysis; prediction of psychosis; semantic coherence; syntactic complexity; high-risk youths; machine learning	LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; FORMAL THOUGHT-DISORDER; CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; COMMUNICATION DISORDERS; PRODROMAL-SYMPTOMS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SPEECH; RELIABILITY; DISCOURSE; VALIDITY	Language and speech are the primary source of data for psychiatrists to diagnose and treat mental disorders. In psychosis, the very structure of language can be disturbed, including semantic coherence (e.g., derailment and tangentiality) and syntactic complexity (e.g., concreteness). Subtle disturbances in language are evident in schizophrenia even prior to first psychosis onset, during prodromal stages. Using computer-based natural language processing analyses, we previously showed that, among English-speaking clinical (e.g., ultra) high-risk youths, baseline reduction in semantic coherence (the flow of meaning in speech) and in syntactic complexity could predict subsequent psychosis onset with high accuracy. Herein, we aimed to cross-validate these automated linguistic analytic methods in a second larger risk cohort, also English-speaking, and to discriminate speech in psychosis from normal speech. We identified an automated machine-learning speech classifier - comprising decreased semantic coherence, greater variance in that coherence, and reduced usage of possessive pronouns - that had an 83% accuracy in predicting psychosis onset (intra-protocol), a cross-validated accuracy of 79% of psychosis onset prediction in the original risk cohort (cross-protocol), and a 72% accuracy in discriminating the speech of recent-onset psychosis patients from that of healthy individuals. The classifier was highly correlated with previously identified manual linguistic predictors. Our findings support the utility and validity of automated natural language processing methods to characterize disturbances in semantics and syntax across stages of psychotic disorder. The next steps will be to apply these methods in larger risk cohorts to further test reproducibility, also in languages other than English, and identify sources of variability. This technology has the potential to improve prediction of psychosis outcome among at-risk youths and identify linguistic targets for remediation and preventive intervention. More broadly, automated linguistic analysis can be a powerful tool for diagnosis and treatment across neuropsychiatry.

J	Yang, G; Ye, QH; Xia, J				Yang, Guang; Ye, Qinghao; Xia, Jun			Unbox the black-box for the medical explainable AI via multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion: A mini-review, two showcases and beyond	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Explainable AI; Information fusion; Multi-domain information fusion; Weakly supervised learning; Medical image analysis	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; DIAGNOSTIC ERRORS; CARE; SYSTEM; FUTURE; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; PROGNOSIS	Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research topic of machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems' black-box choices are made. This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.

J	Ni, FT; Zhang, J; Chen, ZQ				Ni, FuTao; Zhang, Jian; Chen, ZhiQiang			Pixel-level crack delineation in images with convolutional feature fusion	STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING			English	Article						crack detection; deep learning; digital image; features fusion; transfer learning		Cracks in civil structures are important signs of structural degradation and may even indicate the inception of catastrophic failure. Image-based crack detection has been attempted in research communities that bear the potential of replacing human-based inspection. Among many methodologies, deep learning-based cracks detection is actively explored in recent years. However, how to automatically extract cracks quickly and accurately at a pixel level, that is, crack delineation (including both detection and segmentation), is a challenging issue. This article proposes a convolutional neural network-based framework that automates this task through convolutional feature fusion and pixel-level classification. The resulting network architecture with an empirically optimal fusion strategy, termed the crack delineation network, is trained and tested based on a concrete crack image database. The results show that the proposed framework can delineate cracks accurately and rapidly in images towards a fully autonomous machine vision approach to structural crack detection.

Clinical validation of a targeted methylation-based multi-cancer early detection test using an independent validation set	ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY			English	Article						cancer; multi-cancer early detection; liquid biopsy; methylation; cell-free nucleic acids; machine learning	OVERDIAGNOSIS; PERFORMANCE; UPDATE	Background: A multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test used to complement existing screening could increase the number of cancers detected through population screening, potentially improving clinical outcomes. The Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas study (CCGA; NCT02889978) was a prospective, case-controlled, observational study and demonstrated that a blood-based MCED test utilizing cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing in combination with machine learning could detect cancer signals across multiple cancer types and predict cancer signal origin (CSO) with high accuracy. The objective of this third and final CCGA substudy was to validate an MCED test version further refined for use as a screening tool. Patients and methods: This pre-specified substudy included 4077 participants in an independent validation set (cancer: n = 2823; non-cancer: n = 1254, non-cancer status confirmed at year-one follow-up). Specificity, sensitivity, and CSO prediction accuracy were measured. Results: Specificity for cancer signal detection was 99.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 99.0% to 99.8%]. Overall sensitivity for cancer signal detection was 51.5% (49.6% to 53.3%); sensitivity increased with stage [stage I: 16.8% (14.5% to 19.5%), stage II: 40.4% (36.8% to 44.1%), stage III: 77.0% (73.4% to 80.3%), stage IV: 90.1% (87.5% to 92.2%)]. Stage I-III sensitivity was 67.6% (64.4% to 70.6%) in 12 pre-specified cancers that account for approximately two-thirds of annual USA cancer deaths and was 40.7% (38.7% to 42.9%) in all cancers. Cancer signals were detected across >50 cancer types. Overall accuracy of CSO prediction in true positives was 88.7% (87.0% to 90.2%). Conclusion: In this pre-specified, large-scale, clinical validation substudy, the MCED test demonstrated high specificity and accuracy of CSO prediction and detected cancer signals across a wide diversity of cancers. These results support the feasibility of this blood-based MCED test as a complement to existing single-cancer screening tests.	[Klein, E.

It is either diagnosed malignant or benign - depending upon the severity of the infection and the current stage. The conventional methods require a detailed physical inspection by an expert dermatologist, which is time-consuming and imprecise. Therefore, several computer vision methods are introduced lately, which are cost-effective and somewhat accurate. In this work, we propose a new automated approach for skin lesion detection and recognition using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The proposed cascaded design incorporates three fundamental steps including; a) contrast enhancement through fast local Laplacian filtering (FlLpF) along HSV color transformation; b) lesion boundary extraction using color CNN approach by following XOR operation; c) in-depth features extraction by applying transfer learning using Inception V3 model prior to feature fusion using hamming distance (HD) approach. An entropy controlled feature selection method is also introduced for the selection of the most discriminant features. The proposed method is tested on PH2 and ISIC 2017 datasets, whereas the recognition phase is validated on PH2, ISBI 2016, and ISBI 2017 datasets. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed method outperforms several existing methods and attained accuracy 98.4% on PH2 dataset, 95.1% on ISBI dataset and 94.8% on ISBI 2017 dataset.

Short-term time series wind speed forecasts are extremely sig-nificant for proper and efficient offshore wind energy evaluation and in turn, benefit wind farm owner, grid operators as well as end customers. In this study, a Seasonal Auto-Regression Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is proposed to predict hourly-measured wind speeds in the coastal/offshore area of Scotland. The used datasets consist of three wind speed time series collected at different ele-vations from a coastal met mast, which was designed to serve for a demonstration offshore wind turbine. To verify SARIMA's performance, the developed predictive model was further compared with the newly developed deep-learning-based algorithms of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Regardless of the recent development of computational power has triggered more advanced machine learning algorithms, the proposed SARIMA model has shown its outperformance in the accu-racy of forecasting future lags of offshore wind speeds along with time series. The SARIMA model pro-vided the highest accuracy and robust healthiness among all the three tested predictive models based on corresponding datasets and assessed forecasting horizons.

Here we describe the Places Database, a repository of 10 million scene photographs, labeled with scene semantic categories, comprising a large and diverse list of the types of environments encountered in the world. Using the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we provide scene classification CNNs (Places-CNNs) as baselines, that significantly outperform the previous approaches. Visualization of the CNNs trained on Places shows that object detectors emerge as an intermediate representation of scene classification. With its high-coverage and high-diversity of exemplars, the Places Database along with the Places-CNNs offer a novel resource to guide future progress on scene recognition problems.

This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. (C) 2020 The Authors.

To this end, a novel hybrid forecasting approach combining two-layer decomposition, improved hybrid differential evolution-Harris hawks optimization (IHDEHHO), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is proposed. Primarily, a set of subcomponents are obtained by decomposing the collected raw wind speed series with two-layer decomposition strategy. Subsequently, all the sub-components are reconstructed into the corresponding phase space matrixes by PSR, after which the vectors are divided into training, validation and testing sets, respectively. Among the subsets, training set and validation set are applied to establish prediction model and select optimal parameters of KELM. Later, the optimization for arguments within PSR and KELM are synchronously implemented by the proposed IHDEHHO algorithm. Afterward, the final forecast results are deduced by cumulating the forecasting values of all sub-components. Through the application on three datasets collected from Sotavento Galicia (SG) with different prediction horizons and comparison with six related models, it is attested that the proposed hybrid prediction model is effective and suitable for multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting.

Plenty of studies have used machine learning models to produce reliable susceptibility maps. Nevertheless, most research ignores the importance of developing appropriate feature engineering methods. In this study, we propose a local spatial sequential long short-term memory neural network (LSS-LSTM) for flood susceptibility prediction in Shangyou County, China. The three main contributions of this study are summarized below. First of all, it is a new perspective to use the deep learning technique of LSTM for flood susceptibility prediction. Second, we integrate an appropriate feature engineering method with LSTM to predict flood susceptibility. Third, we implement two optimization techniques of data augmentation and batch normalization to further improve the performance of the proposed method. The LSS-LSTM method can not only capture the attribution information of flood conditioning factors and the local spatial information of flood data, but also has powerful sequential modelling capabilities to deal with the spatial relationship of floods. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSS-LSTM method achieves satisfactory prediction performance (93.75% and 0.965) in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Diseases; Lung; Databases; X-ray imaging; Machine learning; Tools; COVID-19; Artificial intelligence; COVID-19 pneumonia; machine learning; transfer learning; viral pneumonia; computer-aided diagnostic tool	DEEP; WUHAN	Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.	[Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

A novel approach to predict shear strength of tilted angle connectors using artificial intelligence techniques	ENGINEERING WITH COMPUTERS			English	Article						Tilted angle shear connectors; System identification; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Extreme learning machine; Artificial neural network	FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; NEURAL-NETWORK; CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR; CHANNEL; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; MOMENT; SELECTION	Shear connectors play a prominent role in the design of steel-concrete composite systems. The behavior of shear connectors is generally determined through conducting push-out tests. However, these tests are costly and require plenty of time. As an alternative approach, soft computing (SC) can be used to eliminate the need for conducting push-out tests. This study aims to investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, as sub-branches of SC methods, in the behavior prediction of an innovative type of C-shaped shear connectors, called Tilted Angle Connectors. For this purpose, several push-out tests are conducted on these connectors and the required data for the AI models are collected. Then, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed to identify the most influencing parameters on the shear strength of the tilted angle connectors. Totally, six different models are created based on the ANFIS results. Finally, AI techniques such as an artificial neural network (ANN), an extreme learning machine (ELM), and another ANFIS are employed to predict the shear strength of the connectors in each of the six models. The results of the paper show that slip is the most influential factor in the shear strength of tilted connectors and after that, the inclination angle is the most effective one. Moreover, it is deducted that considering only four parameters in the predictive models is enough to have a very accurate prediction. It is also demonstrated that ELM needs less time and it can reach slightly better performance indices than those of ANN and ANFIS.

Here, we proposed two novel intelligence hybrid models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO), for obtaining a reliable estimate of landslide susceptibility. Sixteen causative factors and 391 historical landslide events from a landslide-prone area of the State of Uttarakhand, northern India, were used to generate a geospatial database. The ANFIS model was employed to develop an initial landslide susceptibility model that was then optimized using the GWO and BBO algorithms. This resulted in two novel models, i.e., ANFIS-BBO and ANFIS-GWO, that benefited from an intelligent approach to automatically and properly adjust the best parameters of the base ANFIS model for the prediction of landslide susceptibilities. The robustness of the models was verified through a large number of runs using different splits of training and validation datasets. Although few differences observed between the predictive capability of the models (AUC(ANFIS-BBO) = 0.95; RMSEANFIS-BBO = 0.316 vs. ACU(ANFIS-GWO) = 0.94; RMSEANFIS-GWO = 0.322), the Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a significant difference between the model performances in both training and validation datasets. Overall, our proposed models demonstrated an improved prediction of landslides compared to those achieved in previous studies with other methods. Therefore, these novel models can be recommended for modeling landslide susceptibility, and the modelers can easily tailor their use based on their individual circumstances.

These results have sparked a renewed interest in the AD problem and led to the introduction of a great variety of new methods. With the emergence of numerous such methods, including approaches based on generative models, one-class classification, and reconstruction, there is a growing need to bring methods of this field into a systematic and unified perspective. In this review, we aim to identify the common underlying principles and the assumptions that are often made implicitly by various methods. In particular, we draw connections between classic "shallow" and novel deep approaches and show how this relation might cross-fertilize or extend both directions.

The IoUT technology is intricately linked with intelligent boats and ships, smart shores and oceans, automatic marine transportations, positioning and navigation, underwater exploration, disaster prediction and prevention, as well as with intelligent monitoring and security. The IoUT has an influence at various scales ranging from a small scientific observatory, to a mid-sized harbor, and to covering global oceanic trade. The network architecture of IoUT is intrinsically heterogeneous and should be sufficiently resilient to operate in harsh environments. This creates major challenges in terms of underwater communications, whilst relying on limited energy resources. Additionally, the volume, velocity, and variety of data produced by sensors, hydrophones, and cameras in IoUT is enormous, giving rise to the concept of Big Marine Data (BMD), which has its own processing challenges. Hence, conventional data processing techniques will falter, and bespoke Machine Learning (ML) solutions have to be employed for automatically learning the specific BMD behavior and features facilitating knowledge extraction and decision support. The motivation of this article is to comprehensively survey the IoUT, BMD, and their synthesis. It also aims for exploring the nexus of BMD with ML. We set out from underwater data collection and then discuss the family of IoUT data communication techniques with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art research challenges. We then review the suite of ML solutions suitable for BMD handling and analytics. We treat the subject deductively from an educational perspective, critically appraising the material surveyed. Accordingly, the reader will become familiar with the pivotal issues of IoUT and BMD processing, whilst gaining an insight into the state-of-the-art applications, tools, and techniques. Finally, we analyze the architectural challenges of the IoUT, followed by proposing a range of promising direction for research and innovation in the broad areas of IoUT and BMD. Our hope is to inspire researchers, engineers, data scientists, and governmental bodies to further progress the field, to develop new tools and techniques, as well as to make informed decisions and set regulations related to the maritime and underwater environments around the world.

Kernel Methods for Predicting Yields of Chemical Reactions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; CHEMISTRY; CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY; PROGRAM; MODELS; SYSTEM; QSAR	The use of machine learning methods for the prediction of reaction yield is an emerging area. We demonstrate the applicability of support vector regression (SVR) for predicting reaction yields, using combinatorial data. Molecular descriptors used in regression tasks related to chemical reactivity have often been based on time-consuming, computationally demanding quantum chemical calculations, usually density functional theory. Structure-based descriptors (molecular fingerprints and molecular graphs) are quicker and easier to calculate and are applicable to any molecule. In this study, SVR models built on structure-based descriptors were compared to models built on quantum chemical descriptors. The models were evaluated along the dimension of each reaction component in a set of Buchwald-Hartwig amination reactions. The structure-based SVR models outperformed the quantum chemical SVR models, along the dimension of each reaction component. The applicability of the models was assessed with respect to similarity to training. Prospective predictions of unseen Buchwald-Hartwig reactions are presented for synthetic assessment, to validate the generalizability of the models, with particular interest along the aryl halide dimension.

Model reduction of dynamical systems on nonlinear manifolds using deep convolutional autoencoders	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Model reduction; Deep learning; Autoencoders; Machine learning; Nonlinear manifolds; Optimal projection	PETROV-GALERKIN PROJECTION; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ORDER REDUCTION; EIGENMAPS; EQUATIONS	Nearly all model-reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. Such subspaces are typically computed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the reduced-basis method, and (balanced) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Unfortunately, restricting the state to evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs can be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if the problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., diffusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit a slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To address this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems onto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the time-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin projection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) projection. We perform analyses that provide insight into the relationship between these proposed approaches and classical linear-subspace reduced-order models; we also derive a posteriori discrete-time error bounds for the proposed approaches. In addition, we propose a computationally practical approach for computing the nonlinear manifold, which is based on convolutional autoencoders from deep learning. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the method to significantly outperform even the optimal linear-subspace ROM on benchmark advection-dominated problems, thereby demonstrating the method's ability to overcome the intrinsic n-width limitations of linear subspaces.

Among all applications of PAN the widely used application is in manufacture of precursor fiber for fabrication of carbon fibers. The process of PAN-based carbon fiber production comprises fiber spinning, thermal stabilization and carbonization stages. Carbon fiber properties are significantly dependent on the quality of PAN precursor fiber and in particular the process parameters involved in thermal stabilization. This paper is the first comprehensive review that provides a general understanding of the links between PAN fiber structure, properties, and its stabilization process along with the use of mathematical modelling as a powerful tool in prediction and optimization of the processes involved. Since the promise of the mathematical modelling is to predict the future behaviour of the system and the value of the variables for the unseen or unmeasured domain of variables; and in the era of industry 4.0 rise, this review will be valuable in further understanding of the intricate processes of carbon fiber manufacture and utilising the advanced mathematical modelling using machine learning techniques to predict and optimize a range of critical factors that control the quality of PAN and resultant carbon fibers.

They are often exploited as a building block for developing emotion recognition learning models, and/or used as baselines to which the performance of the models can be compared. In this work, we contribute two new resources, that we call DepecheMood++ (DM++) : a) an extension of an existing and widely used emotion lexicon for English; and b) a novel version of the lexicon, targeting Italian. Furthermore, we show how simple techniques can be used, both in supervised and unsupervised experimental settings, to boost performance on datasets and tasks of varying degree of domain-specificity. Also, we report an extensive comparative analysis against other available emotion lexica and state-of-the-art supervised approaches, showing that DepecheMood++ emerges as the best-performing non-domain-specific lexicon in unsupervised settings. We also observe that simple learning models on top of DM++ can provide more challenging baselines. We finally introduce embedding-based methodologies to perform a) vocabulary expansion to address data scarcity and b) vocabulary porting to new languages in case training data is not available.

Face recognition accuracy of forensic examiners, superrecognizers, and face recognition algorithms	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						face identification; forensic science; face recognition algorithm; wisdom-of-crowds; machine learning technology	PERSON RECOGNITION; PEOPLE; BODY	Achieving the upper limits of face identification accuracy in forensic applications can minimize errors that have profound social and personal consequences. Although forensic examiners identify faces in these applications, systematic tests of their accuracy are rare. How can we achieve the most accurate face identification: using people and/or machines working alone or in collaboration? In a comprehensive comparison of face identification by humans and computers, we found that forensic facial examiners, facial reviewers, and superrecognizers were more accurate than fingerprint examiners and students on a challenging face identification test. Individual performance on the test varied widely. On the same test, four deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), developed between 2015 and 2017, identified faces within the range of human accuracy. Accuracy of the algorithms increased steadily over time, with the most recent DCNN scoring above the median of the forensic facial examiners. Using crowd-sourcing methods, we fused the judgments of multiple forensic facial examiners by averaging their rating-based identity judgments. Accuracy was substantially better for fused judgments than for individuals working alone. Fusion also served to stabilize performance, boosting the scores of lower-performing individuals and decreasing variability. Single forensic facial examiners fused with the best algorithm were more accurate than the combination of two examiners. Therefore, collaboration among humans and between humans and machines offers tangible benefits to face identification accuracy in important applications. These results offer an evidence-based roadmap for achieving the most accurate face identification possible.	[Phillips, P.

J	Di Vaio, A; Palladino, R; Hassan, R; Escobar, O				Di Vaio, Assunta; Palladino, Rosa; Hassan, Rohail; Escobar, Octavio			Artificial intelligence and business models in the sustainable development goals perspective: A systematic literature review	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH			English	Review						Artificial Intelligence (AI); Machine learning sustainability; Cultural drift; Sustainable business models; Knowledge Management System (KMS)	BIG DATA; KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION-SUPPORT; SOCIAL MEDIA; CHALLENGES; INNOVATION; HEALTH; METHODOLOGY; BLOCKCHAIN	This paper investigates the literary corpus on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the construction of sustainable business models (SBMs). It provides a quantitative overview of the academic literature that constitutes the field. The paper discusses the relationships between AI and rapid developments in machine learning and sustainable development (SD). Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI's association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs.	[Di Vaio, Assunta; Palladino, Rosa] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Law, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Hassan, Rohail] Univ Utara Malaysia, Othman Yeop Abdullah Grad Sch Business OYAGSB, Sintok 06010, Kedah Darul Ama, Malaysia; [Escobar, Octavio] EM Normandie Business Sch, Metis Lab, 64 Rue Ranelagh, F-75016 Paris, France		Di Vaio, A (corresponding author), Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Law, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.	susy.divaio@uniparthenope.it	Hassan, Rohail/G-1213-2015; Di Vaio, Assunta/N-2259-2019; Di Vaio, Susy/ABF-7157-2020	Hassan, Rohail/0000-0002-7825-0283; Di Vaio, Assunta/0000-0002-0498-1630; Escobar, Octavio/0000-0001-9649-6079	Department of Law [002158]; University of Naples "Parthenope" (Italy)	Department of Law; University of Naples "Parthenope" (Italy)	This research has been funded by Department of Law, number 002158, University of Naples "Parthenope" (Italy).		113	116	116	87	258	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA	0148-2963	1873-7978		J BUS RES	J.

Real-time, nondestructive monitoring of crop growth is instructive for the diagnosis of crop growth and prediction of grain yield. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing is widely used in precision agriculture due to its unique advantages in flexibility and resolution. This study was carried out on wheat trials treated with different nitrogen levels and seeding densities in three regions of Jiangsu Province in 2018-2019. Canopy spectral images were collected by the UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera during key wheat growth stages. To verify the results of the UAV images, the LAI, LDM, and yield data were obtained by destructive sampling. We extracted the wheat canopy reflectance and selected the best vegetation index for monitoring growth and predicting yield. Simple linear regression (LR), multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF) modeling methods were used to construct a model for wheat yield estimation. The results show that the multi-spectral camera mounted on the multi-rotor UAV has a broad application prospect in crop growth index monitoring and yield estimation. The vegetation index combined with the red edge band and the near-infrared band was significantly correlated with LAI and LDM. Machine learning methods (i.e., PLSR, ANN, and RF) performed better for predicting wheat yield. The RF model constructed by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at the jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage, and filling stage was the optimal wheat yield estimation model in this study, with an R-2 of 0.78 and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 0.1030. The results provide a theoretical basis for monitoring crop growth with a multi-rotor UAV platform and explore a technical method for improving the precision of yield estimation.

The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model is recommended as the reference model to predict ET0, but its application is commonly restricted by lack of complete meteorological data at many worldwide locations. This study evaluated the potential of machine learning models, particularly four relatively simple tree-based assemble algorithms (Le. random forest (RF), M5 model tree (M5Tree), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)), for estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data using a K-fold cross-validation method. For assessment of the tree-based models in terms of prediction accuracy, stability and computational costs, these models were further compared with their corresponding support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. Four input combinations of daily maximum and maximum temperature (T-max and T-min), relative humidity (H-r), wind speed (U-2), global and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (R-s and R-a) with T-max, T-min and R-a as the base dataset were considered using meteorological data during 1961-2010 from eight representative weather stations in different climates of China. The results showed that, when lack of complete meteorological data, the machine learning models using T-max, T-min, H-r, U-2 and R-a obtained satisfactory ET0 estimates in the temperate continental, mountain plateau and temperate monsoon zones of China (RMSE < 0.5 mm d(-1)). However, models with three input parameters of T-max, T-min and R-s were superior for daily ET0 prediction in the tropical and subtropical zones. The ELM and SVM models offered the best combination of prediction accuracy and stability. The simple tree-based XGBoost and GBDT models showed comparable accuracy and stability to the SVM and ELM models, but exhibited much less computational costs. Considering the complexity level, prediction accuracy, stability and computational costs of the studied models, the XGBoost and GBDT models have been recommended for daily ET0 estimation in different climatic zones of China and maybe elsewhere with similar climates around the world.

Assessing the hazard they pose and what drives their movement in the years following the mainshock has not yet been attempted, primarily because multitemporal landslide inventories are lacking. By exploiting a multitemporal inventory (2005-2018) covering the epicentral region of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake and a set of conditioning factors (seismic, topographic, and hydrological), we perform statistical tests to understand the temporal evolution of these factors affecting debris remobilizations. Our analyses, supported by a random-forest susceptibility assessment model, reveal a prediction capability of seismic-related variables declining with time, as opposed to hydro-topographic parameters gaining importance and becoming predominant within a decade. These results may have important implications on the way conventional susceptibility/hazard assessment models should be employed in areas where coseismic landslides are the main sediment production mechanism on slopes. Plain Language Summary Strong earthquakes in mountain regions can trigger thousands of landslides, forming deposits of rock and soil debris along steep slopes. Months to years later, rainstorms may generate debris flows-destructive water-debris mixtures that rush downslope and flood valleys. Scientists use models to estimate the hazard of landslides and debris flows, which are based on accurate maps of the slopes, the type of rock or soil, inventories of known landslides, rainfall trends, and more. Susceptibility and hazard maps are the main product of these models. They are used to predict the probability of a hazardous event occurring at a given location in a given time span. These maps are usually "static," in the sense that they are thought to remain valid for a long time because the data they are based upon (such as the shape of slopes) do not vary much. However, postearthquake landscapes are very dynamic: debris moves downslope, carried by rain or shaken by aftershocks; meanwhile, new landslides occur on some slopes, while others revegetate and stabilize. The overall picture is complex as many variables are involved. We use machine learning to demonstrate that static hazard maps become unable to predict landslides after just a few years, and advocate for the use of frequently updated maps linked to fresh inputs, tracking the location and activity of debris deposits, and old and new	[Fan, Xuanmei; Yunus, Ali P.; Siva Subramanian, Srikrishnan; Xu, Qiang; Huang, Runqui] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Scaringi, Gianvito] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Hydrogeol Engn Geol & Appl Geophys, Fac Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Catani, Filippo] Univ Padua, Dept Geosci, Padua, Italy		Fan, XM; Yunus, AP (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	fxm_cdut@qq.com; yunusp@cdut.edu.cn	Scaringi, Gianvito/W-8817-2019; ALI, YUNUS/O-7015-2019; Catani, Filippo/AHC-3484-2022; Catani, Filippo/B-8518-2016; Siva Subramanian, Srikrishnan/O-6437-2017	Scaringi, Gianvito/0000-0003-3505-7456; ALI, YUNUS/0000-0001-6852-145X; Catani, Filippo/0000-0001-5185-4725; Siva Subramanian, Srikrishnan/0000-0003-4004-0894	Funds for Creative Research Groups of China [41521002]; National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of China [41622206]; Fund of SKLGP [SKLGP2019Z002]; Fund for International Mobility of Researchers at Charles University [CZ.02.2.69/0.0/0.0/16_027/0008495]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [20-28853Y]	Funds for Creative Research Groups of China(Science Fund for Creative Research Groups); National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); Fund of SKLGP; Fund for International Mobility of Researchers at Charles University; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)	This research is financially supported by the Funds for Creative Research Groups of China (Grant No. 41521002), the National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of China (Grant No. 41622206), and the Fund of SKLGP (SKLGP2019Z002).

Problems with timing, efficiency, and missed diagnoses occur at all stages of the imaging chain. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is dependent on robust data; the application of appropriate computational approaches and tools; and validation of its clinical application to image segmentation, automated measurements, and eventually, automated diagnosis. AI may reduce cost and improve value at the stages of image acquisition, interpretation, and decision-making. Moreover, the precision now possible with cardiovascular imaging, combined with "big data" from the electronic health record and pathology, is likely to better characterize disease and personalize therapy.

The Discriminative Lexicon: A Unified Computational Model for the Lexicon and Lexical Processing in Comprehension and Production Grounded Not in (De)Composition but in Linear Discriminative Learning	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROSODIC THEORY; DUAL-ROUTE; MORPHOLOGY; PHONOLOGY; FREQUENCY; MEANINGS; REPRESENTATION	The discriminative lexicon is introduced as a mathematical and computational model of the mental lexicon. This novel theory is inspired by word and paradigm morphology but operationalizes the concept of proportional analogy using the mathematics of linear algebra. It embraces the discriminative perspective on language, rejecting the idea that words' meanings are compositional in the sense of Frege and Russell and arguing instead that the relation between form and meaning is fundamentally discriminative. The discriminative lexicon also incorporates the insight from machine learning that end-to-end modeling is much more effective than working with a cascade of models targeting individual subtasks. The computational engine at the heart of the discriminative lexicon is linear discriminative learning: simple linear networks are used for mapping form onto meaning and meaning onto form, without requiring the hierarchies of post-Bloomfieldian hidden' constructs such as phonemes, morphemes, and stems. We show that this novel model meets the criteria of accuracy (it properly recognizes words and produces words correctly), productivity (the model is remarkably successful in understanding and producing novel complex words), and predictivity (it correctly predicts a wide array of experimental phenomena in lexical processing). The discriminative lexicon does not make use of static representations that are stored in memory and that have to be accessed in comprehension and production. It replaces static representations by states of the cognitive system that arise dynamically as a consequence of external or internal stimuli. The discriminative lexicon brings together visual and auditory comprehension as well as speech production into an integrated dynamic system of coupled linear networks.	[Baayen, R.

Understanding contexts within different online medical communications and activities becomes a significant issue to facilitate patients' medical decision making process. As a subcategory of machine learning, neural networks have drawn increasing attentions in natural language processing applications. In this article, we focus on modeling and analyzing the patient-physician-generated data based on an integrated CNN-RNN framework, in order to deal with the situation that patients' online inquiries are usually not very long. A so-called DP-CRNN algorithm is developed with a newly designed neural network structure, to extract and highlight the combination of semantic and sequential features in terms of patient's inquiries. An intelligent recommendation method is then proposed to provide patients with automatic clinic guidance and pre-diagnosis suggestions, in which a clustering mechanism is utilized to refine the learning process with more precise diagnosis scope and more representative features. Experiments based on the collected real world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and method for intelligent pre-diagnosis service in online medical environments.

Among various excellent solutions, the recently proposed multiple kernel k-means with incomplete kernels (MKKM-IK) forms a benchmark, which redefines IMVC as a joint optimization problem where the clustering and kernel matrix imputation tasks are alternately performed until convergence. Though demonstrating promising performance in various applications, we observe that the manner of kernel matrix imputation in MKKM-IK would incur intensive computational and storage complexities, over-complicated optimization and limitedly improved clustering performance. In this paper, we first propose an Efficient and Effective Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (EE-IMVC) algorithm to address these issues. Instead of completing the incomplete kernel matrices, EE-IMVC proposes to impute each incomplete base matrix generated by incomplete views with a learned consensus clustering matrix. Moreover, we further improve this algorithm by incorporating prior knowledge to regularize the learned consensus clustering matrix. Two three-step iterative algorithms are carefully developed to solve the resultant optimization problems with linear computational complexity, and their convergence is theoretically proven. After that, we theoretically study the generalization bound of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments to study the proposed algorithms in terms of clustering accuracy, evolution of the learned consensus clustering matrix and the convergence. As indicated, our algorithms deliver their effectiveness by significantly and consistently outperforming some state-of-the-art ones.

BioTransformer: a comprehensive computational tool for small molecule metabolism prediction and metabolite identification	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article						Metabolism prediction; Metabolite identification; Biotransformation; Microbial degradation; Mass spectrometry; Machine learning; Knowledge-based system; Structure-based classification; Metabolic pathway; Enzyme-substrate specificity	DRUG-METABOLISM; KNOWLEDGE; PATHWAYS; DATABASE; ENZYMES; WATER; CHLORPYRIFOS; PERSPECTIVES; METABOLOMICS; COLLECTION	BackgroundA number of computational tools for metabolism prediction have been developed over the last 20years to predict the structures of small molecules undergoing biological transformation or environmental degradation. These tools were largely developed to facilitate absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies, although there is now a growing interest in using such tools to facilitate metabolomics and exposomics studies. However, their use and widespread adoption is still hampered by several factors, including their limited scope, breath of coverage, availability, and performance.ResultsTo address these limitations, we have developed BioTransformer, a freely available software package for accurate, rapid, and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction and compound identification. BioTransformer combines a machine learning approach with a knowledge-based approach to predict small molecule metabolism in human tissues (e.g. liver tissue), the human gut as well as the environment (soil and water microbiota), via its metabolism prediction tool. A comprehensive evaluation of BioTransformer showed that it was able to outperform two state-of-the-art commercially available tools (Meteor Nexus and ADMET Predictor), with precision and recall values up to 7 times better than those obtained for Meteor Nexus or ADMET Predictor on the same sets of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, phytochemicals or endobiotics under similar or identical constraints. Furthermore BioTransformer was able to reproduce 100% of the transformations and metabolites predicted by the EAWAG pathway prediction system. Using mass spectrometry data obtained from a rat experimental study with epicatechin supplementation, BioTransformer was also able to correctly identify 39 previously reported epicatechin metabolites via its metabolism identification tool, and suggest 28 potential metabolites, 17 of which matched nine monoisotopic masses for which no evidence of a previous report could be found.ConclusionBioTransformer can be used as an open access command-line tool, or a software library. It is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/djoumbou/biotransformerjar/. Moreover, it is also freely available as an open access RESTful application at www.biotransformer.ca, which allows users to manually or programmatically submit queries, and retrieve metabolism predictions or compound identification data.

The manual examination of these signals by experts is strenuous and time consuming. Hence, machine learning techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of detection. Nowadays, deep learning methodologies have been used in medical field to diagnose the health conditions precisely and aid the clinicians. In this study, a new deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) model is proposed for the automatic recognition of normal and abnormal EEG signals. The proposed model is a complete end-to-end structure which classifies the EEG signals without requiring any feature extraction. In this study, we have used the EEG signals from temporal to occipital (T5-O1) single channel obtained from Temple University Hospital EEG Abnormal Corpus (v2.0.0) EEG dataset to develop the 1D CNN model. Our developed model has yielded the classification error rate of 20.66% in classifying the normal and abnormal EEG signals.

Philip			GCB-Net: Graph Convolutional Broad Network and Its Application in Emotion Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						Emotion recognition; graph convolutional neural networks; broad learning system; graph convolutional broad network	EEG; SYSTEM; APPROXIMATION; ENTROPY; SIGNALS; GESTURE	In recent years, emotion recognition has become a research focus in the area of artificial intelligence. Due to its irregular structure, EEG data can be analyzed by applying graphical based algorithms or models much more efficiently. In this work, a Graph Convolutional Broad Network (GCB-net) was designed for exploring the deeper-level information of graph-structured data. It used the graph convolutional layer to extract features of graph-structured input and stacks multiple regular convolutional layers to extract relatively abstract features. The final concatenation utilized the broad concept, which preserves the outputs of all hierarchical layers, allowing the model to search features in broad spaces. To improve the performance of the proposed GCB-net, the broad learning system (BLS) was applied to enhance its features. For comparison, two individual experiments were conducted to examine the efficiency of the proposed GCB-net based on the SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and DREAMER dataset respectively. In SEED, compared with other state-of-art methods, the GCB-net could better promote the accuracy (reaching 94.24 percent) on the DE feature of the all-frequency band. In DREAMER dataset, GCB-net performed better than other models with the same setting. Furthermore, the GCB-net reached high accuracies of 86.99, 89.32 and 89.20 percent on dimensions of Valence, Arousal and Dominance respectively. The experimental results showed the robust classifying ability of the GCB-net and BLS in EEG emotion recognition.	[Zhang, Tong; Wang, Xuehan; Chen, C. L.

In this article, we propose a continuous object boundary tracking algorithm for IWSNs - which fully exploits the collective intelligence and machine learning capability within the sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm first determines an upper bound of the event region covered by the continuous objects. A binary tree-based partition is performed within the event region, obtaining a coarse-grained boundary area mapping. To study the irregularity of continuous objects in detail, the boundary tracking problem is then transformed into a binary classification problem; a hierarchical soft margin support vector machine training strategy is designed to address the binary classification problem in a distributed fashion. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows a reduction in the number of nodes required for boundary tracking by at least 50 percent. Without additional fault-tolerant mechanisms, the proposed algorithm is inherently robust to false sensor readings, even for high ratios of faulty nodes (approximate to 9%).

Edge computing powers MCS to form the mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) framework. Privacy disclosure of sensing data in multiple stages is a significant challenge in the MECS. To tackle this issue, combining machine learning with game theory, in this article, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)enabled three-party game (ATG) framework for guaranteed data privacy in the MECS of IoT. Specifically, based on the random forest classifier and the k-anonymity algorithm, we propose a classification-anonymity model that effectively guarantees the privacy of sensitive data. Moreover, we construct a three-party game model for analyzing the data privacy leakage in different phases in the MECS. Finally, we conduct numerical and theoretical analyses and ample simulations. The results indicate that the ATG framework is effective and efficient, and better suited to the MECS of IoT.

Machine vision and its associated emerging technology promise huge potential in advanced agricultural applications. However, machine vision and its precise positioning still have many technical difficulties, making it difficult for most harvesting robots to achieve true commercial applications. This article reports the application and research progress of harvesting robots and vision technology in fruit picking. The potential applications of vision and quantitative methods of localization, target recognition, 3D reconstruction, and fault tolerance of complex agricultural environment are focused, and fault-tolerant technology designed for utilization with machine vision and robotic systems are also explored. The two main methods used in fruit recognition and localization are reviewed, including digital image processing technology and deep learning-based algorithms. The future challenges brought about by recognition and localization success rates are identified: target recognition in the presence of illumination changes and occlusion environments; target tracking in dynamic interference-laden environments, 3D target reconstruction, and fault tolerance of the vision system for agricultural robots. In the end, several open research problems specific to recognition and localization applications for fruit harvesting robots are mentioned, and the latest development and future development trends of machine vision are described.

Different expressions of landslide boundaries and spatial shapes may lead to substantial differences in the distribution of predicted landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs); moreover, the presence of irregular landslide boundaries and spatial shapes introduces uncertainties into the LSM. To address this issue by accurately drawing polygonal boundaries based on LSM, the uncertainty patterns of LSM modelling under two different landslide boundaries and spatial shapes, such as landslide points and circles, are compared. Within the research area of Ruijin City in China, a total of 370 landslides with accurate boundary information are obtained, and 10 environmental factors, such as slope and lithology, are selected. Then, correlation analyses between the landslide boundary shapes and selected environmental factors are performed via the frequency ratio (FR) method. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) based on landslide points, circles and accurate landslide polygons are constructed as point-, circle-and polygon-based SVM and RF models, respectively, to address LSM. Finally, the prediction capabilities of the above models are compared by computing their statistical accuracy using receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the uncertainties of the predicted LSIs under the above models are discussed. The results show that using polygonal surfaces with a higher reliability and accuracy to express the landslide boundary and spatial shape can provide a markedly improved LSM accuracy, compared to those based on the points and circles. Moreover, a higher degree of uncertainty of LSM modelling is present in the expression of points because there are too few grid units acting as model input variables. Additionally, the expression of the landslide boundary as circles introduces errors in measurement and is not as accurate as the polygonal boundary in most LSM modelling cases. In addition, the results under different conditions show that the polygon-based models have a higher LSM accuracy, with lower mean values and larger standard deviations compared with the point-and circle-based models. Finally, the overall LSM accuracy of the RF is superior to that of the SVM, and similar patterns of landslide boundary and spatial shape affecting the LSM modelling are reflected in the SVM and RF models.

Solving global and local issues, including food security, water regulation, land degradation, and climate change requires higher quality, more consistent and detailed soil information. Accurate prediction of soil variation over large and complex areas with limited samples remains a challenge, which is especially significant for China due to its vast land area which contains the most diverse soil landscapes in the world. Here, we integrated predictive soil mapping paradigm with adaptive depth function fitting, state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning and high-resolution soil-forming environment characterization in a highperformance parallel computing environment to generate 90-m resolution national gridded maps of nine soil properties (pH, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, cation exchange capacity, bulk density, coarse fragments, and thickness) at multiple depths across China. This was based on approximately 5000 representative soil profiles collected in a recent national soil survey and a suite of detailed covariates to characterize soil-forming environments. The predictive accuracy ranged from very good to moderate (Model Efficiency Coefficients from 0.71 to 0.36) at 0-5 cm. The predictive accuracy for most soil properties declined with depth. Compared with previous soil maps, we achieved significantly more detailed and accurate predictions which could well represent soil variations across the territory and are a significant contribution to the GlobalSoilMap.net project. The relative importance of soil-forming factors in the predictions varied by specific soil property and depth, suggesting the complexity and non-stationarity of comprehensive multi-factor interactions in the process of soil development.

Evidence for cumulative cultural evolution in bird song	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						bird song; categorization; syntax; learning biases; segmentation; cumulative cultural evolution	WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS; A-DEE CALLS; CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; ZEBRA FINCHES; GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION; CAROLINA CHICKADEES; VOCAL-TRACT; MATE CHOICE; COMMUNICATION; CHAFFINCH	In studies of cumulative cultural evolution in non-human animals, the focus is most often on incremental changes that increase the efficacy of an existing form of socially learned behaviour, such as the refinement of migratory pathways. In this paper, we compare the songs of different species to describe patterns of evolution in the acoustic structure of bird songs, and explore the question of what building blocks might underlie cumulative cultural evolution of bird song using a comparative approach. We suggest that three steps occurred: first, imitation of independent sounds, or notes, via social learning; second, the formation of categories of note types; and third, assembling note types into sequences with defined structures. Simple sequences can then be repeated to form simple songs or concatenated with other sequences to form segmented songs, increasing complexity. Variant forms of both the notes and the sequencing rules may then arise due to copy errors and innovation. Some variants may become established in the population because of learning biases or selection, increasing signal efficiency, or because of cultural drift. Cumulative cultural evolution of bird songs thus arises from cognitive processes such as vocal imitation, categorization during memorization and learning biases applied to basic acoustic building blocks.

However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.

J	Huang, H; Xue, CL; Zhang, W; Guo, MX				Huang, Hua; Xue, Chunliang; Zhang, Wei; Guo, Mengxue			Torsion design of CFRP-CFST columns using a data-driven optimization approach	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						CFST columns; Multi-objective optimization; Combined loads; Transfer learning; SHAP values; Overfitting	STEEL TUBE COLUMNS; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SEISMIC BEHAVIOR; CONCRETE; CAPACITY; PERFORMANCE	A challenging issue of utilizing the merit of the machine learning model to the multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem is that sufficient physical experiments data are hard to get. With the limited training data, overfitting of the surrogate model is inevitable, which may mislead the search engine. A data-driven model based on simulations commonly has a better performance for addressing overfitting problems. However, there is a gap between the numerical model and the real structure/physical experiments. In this paper, a framework called data-driven optimization is proposed for structural performance optimization. First, the transfer learning algorithm (two-stage TrAdaBoost) is designed to reweight the simulation data points that have more significant residuals predicted by a base learner (i.e., ensemble machine learning model), which goal is to select the "accuracy" of simulation data points as supplements to the real structure/physical experiments data points, instead of trying to reduce the gap by model-updating methods, as the traditional methods do. In this way, simulation data points relevant to the real structure/physical experiments will be assigned a large weight value. Then, the generated two-stage TrAdaBoost model incorporated with nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to optimize structure design. Finally, this paper used the proposed framework to conduct feature impact analysis, fast predict, and optimize torsion design for the concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) column subjected to combined compression-bending-torsion. The results showed that the two-stage TrAdaBoost algorithm performs better and outperforms the baseline model, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). By typical examples, the proposed framework can be a viable tool for the preliminary design of the CFST column. The Pareto fronts of the two objectives (ultimate torsion strength and cost) are successfully obtained.

J	Mustageem; Kwon, S				Mustageem; Kwon, Soonil			CLSTM: Deep Feature-Based Speech Emotion Recognition Using the Hierarchical ConvLSTM Network	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						affective computing; artificial intelligence; deep learning; ConvLSTM; gated recurrent units (GRUs); speech emotion recognition; raw speech data	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; ARCHITECTURE; RECURRENT; DNN	Artificial intelligence, deep learning, and machine learning are dominant sources to use in order to make a system smarter. Nowadays, the smart speech emotion recognition (SER) system is a basic necessity and an emerging research area of digital audio signal processing. However, SER plays an important role with many applications that are related to human-computer interactions (HCI). The existing state-of-the-art SER system has a quite low prediction performance, which needs improvement in order to make it feasible for the real-time commercial applications. The key reason for the low accuracy and the poor prediction rate is the scarceness of the data and a model configuration, which is the most challenging task to build a robust machine learning technique. In this paper, we addressed the limitations of the existing SER systems and proposed a unique artificial intelligence (AI) based system structure for the SER that utilizes the hierarchical blocks of the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) with sequence learning. We designed four blocks of ConvLSTM, which is called the local features learning block (LFLB), in order to extract the local emotional features in a hierarchical correlation. The ConvLSTM layers are adopted for input-to-state and state-to-state transition in order to extract the spatial cues by utilizing the convolution operations. We placed four LFLBs in order to extract the spatiotemporal cues in the hierarchical correlational form speech signals using the residual learning strategy. Furthermore, we utilized a novel sequence learning strategy in order to extract the global information and adaptively adjust the relevant global feature weights according to the correlation of the input features. Finally, we used the center loss function with the softmax loss in order to produce the probability of the classes. The center loss increases the final classification results and ensures an accurate prediction as well as shows a conspicuous role in the whole proposed SER scheme. We tested the proposed system over two standard, interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) and ryerson audio visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS) speech corpora, and obtained a 75% and an 80% recognition rate, respectively.

However, most deep learning-based objective outcome prediction and grading paradigms are based on histology or genomics alone and do not make use of the complementary information in an intuitive manner. In this work, we propose Pathomic Fusion, an interpretable strategy for end-to-end multimodal fusion of histology image and genomic (mutations, CNV, RNA-Seq) features for survival outcome prediction. Our approach models pairwise feature interactions across modalities by taking the Kronecker product of unimodal feature representations, and controls the expressiveness of each representation via a gating-based attention mechanism. Following supervised learning, we are able to interpret and saliently localize features across each modality, and understand how feature importance shifts when conditioning on multimodal input. We validate our approach using glioma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which contains paired whole-slide image, genotype, and transcriptome data with ground truth survival and histologic grade labels. In a 15-fold cross-validation, our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal fusion paradigm improves prognostic determinations from ground truth grading and molecular subtyping, as well as unimodal deep networks trained on histology and genomic data alone. The proposed method establishes insight and theory on how to train deep networks on multimodal biomedical data in an intuitive manner, which will be useful for other problems in medicine that seek to combine heterogeneous data streams for understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to treatment.

DCNN-Based Multi-Signal Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning (DL); fault diagnosis; induction motor; multi-signal model	WAVELET; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS	Deep learning (DL) architecture, which exploits multiple hidden layers to learn hierarchical representations automatically from massive input data, presents a promising tool for characterizing fault conditions. This paper proposes a DL-based multi-signal fault diagnosis method that leverages the powerful feature learning ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in images. The proposed deep model is able to learn from multiple types of sensor signals simultaneously so that it can achieve robust performance and finally realize accurate induction motor fault recognition. First, the acquired sensor signals are converted to time-frequency distribution (TFD) by wavelet transform. Then, a deep CNN is applied to learning discriminative representations from the TFD images. Since then, a fully connected layer in deep architecture gives the prediction of induction motor condition based on learned features. In order to verify the effectiveness of the designed deep model, experiments are carried out on a machine fault simulator where both vibration and current signals are analyzed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms traditional fault diagnosis methods, hence, demonstrating effectiveness in induction motor application. Compared with conventional methods that rely on delicate features extracted by experienced experts, the proposed deep model is able to automatically learn and select suitable features that contribute to accurate fault diagnosis. Compared with single-signal input, the multi-signal model has more accurate and stable performance and overcomes the overfitting problem to some degree.

Traditional approaches based on computer vision and simple feature extraction could not guarantee high accuracy classification. This paper presents a new approach using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as a generic feature extractor. The extracted features were classified with artificial neural network (ANN), cubic support vector machine (SVM), quadratic SVM, weighted k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), boosted tree, bagged tree, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Models trained with CNN-extracted features demonstrated better classification accuracy of corn seed varieties than models based on only simple features. The CNN-ANN classifier showed the best performance, classifying 2250 test instances in 26.8 s with classification accuracy 98.1%, precision 98.2%, recall 98.1%, and F1-score 98.1%. This study demonstrates that the CNN-ANN classifier is an efficient tool for the intelligent classification of different corn seed varieties. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One class of techniques of growing interest for early stage drug discovery is de novo molecular generation and optimization, catalyzed by the development of new deep learning approaches. These techniques can suggest novel molecular structures intended to maximize a multiobjective function, e.g., suitability as a therapeutic against a particular target, without relying on brute-force exploration of a chemical space. However, the utility of these approaches is stymied by ignorance of synthesizability. To highlight the severity of this issue, we use a data-driven computer-aided synthesis planning program to quantify how often molecules proposed by state-of-the-art generative models cannot be readily synthesized. Our analysis demonstrates that there are several tasks for which these models generate unrealistic molecular structures despite performing well on popular quantitative benchmarks. Synthetic complexity heuristics can successfully bias generation toward synthetically tractable chemical space, although doing so necessarily detracts from the primary objective. This analysis suggests that to improve the utility of these models in real discovery workflows, new algorithm development is warranted.

AI is explored in gastroenterology for endoscopic analysis of lesions, in detection of cancer, and to facilitate the analysis of inflammatory lesions or gastrointestinal bleeding during wireless capsule endoscopy. AI is also tested to assess liver fibrosis and to differentiate patients with pancreatic cancer from those with pancreatitis. AI might also be used to establish prognoses of patients or predict their response to treatments, based on multiple factors. We review the ways in which AI may help physicians make a diagnosis or establish a prognosis and discuss its limitations, knowing that further randomized controlled studies will be required before the approval of AI techniques by the health authorities.

However, it is still a challenging problem to accurately predict protein structural classes for low-similarity sequences. This paper was devoted to develop a powerful method to predict protein structural classes for low-similarity sequences. On the basis of a very objective and strict benchmark dataset, we firstly extracted optimal tripeptide compositions (OTC) which was picked out by using feature selection technique to formulate protein samples. And an overall accuracy of 91.1% was achieved in jackknife cross-validation. Subsequently, we investigated the accuracies of three popular features: position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), predicted secondary structure information (PSSI) and the average chemical shift (ACS) for comparison. Finally, to further improve the prediction performance, we examined all combinations of the four kinds of features and achieved the maximum accuracy of 96.7% in jackknife cross-validation by combining OTC with ACS, demonstrating that the model is efficient and powerful. Our study will provide an important guide to extract valuable information from protein sequences. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, a novel hybrid approach based on multi-scale dominant ingredient chaotic analysis, improved hybrid GWO-SCA (IHGWOSCA) algorithm and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for multi-step short-term wind speed prediction, in which the multi-scale dominant ingredient chaotic analysis combines the proposed optimal variational mode decomposition (OVMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and phase space reconstruction (PSR). To begin with, the mode number and updating step of VMD are pre-determined by center frequency observation method and the proposed least-squares error index (LSEI), thus decomposing the non-stationary wind speed series into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Later, the extraction of the dominant ingredient and residuary ingredient for each sub-series is implemented by SSA for the construction of forecasting components. Subsequently, the proposed IHGWOSCA algorithm coded with discrete integers and real-valued are investigated to search optimal parameters in PSR and ELM successively. Lastly, the ultimate forecasting results of the original wind speed are calculated by accumulating results of all the predicted components. Furthermore, seven data sets from Sotavento Galicia and Inner Mongolia have been employed to evaluate the proposed approach. The results illustrate that: (1) the proposed OVMD-based models obtained better RMSE, MAE and MAPE indexes comparing with the benchmark models through weakening the non stationary of the original signal; (2) the proposed dominant ingredient chaotic analysis combining SSA and PSR enhanced the multi-steps prediction performance effectively; (3) the proposed IHGWOSCA optimization algorithm possessed good capability for optimal parameters searching and fast convergence.

Existing approaches train the networks by exploiting supervised information of the change areas, which, however, is not always available. A main challenge in the unsupervised problem setting is to avoid that change pixels affect the learning of the translation function. We propose two new network architectures trained with loss functions weighted by priors that reduce the impact of change pixels on the learning objective. The change prior is derived in an unsupervised fashion from relational pixel information captured by domain-specific affinity matrices. Specifically, we use the vertex degrees associated with an absolute affinity difference matrix and demonstrate their utility in combination with cycle consistency and adversarial training. The proposed neural networks are compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Experiments conducted on three real data sets show the effectiveness of our methodology.

However, the stochasticity and distribution imbalance are main characteristics to traffic flow, and these will bring the uncertainty and induce the network overfitting problem during deep learning. To deal with the problems, a new end-to-end hybrid deep learning network model, named M-B-LSTM, is proposed for short-term traffic flow forecasting in this paper. In the M-B-LSTM model, an online self-learning network is constructed as a data mapping layer to learn and equalize the traffic flow statistic distribution for reducing the effect of distribution imbalance and overfitting problem during network learning. Besides, the deep bidirectional long short-term memory network (DBLSTM) is introduced to reduce the uncertainty problem by forward and reverse contexts approximation process in the stochasticity reducing layer, and then the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to forecast the next traffic flow state in the forecasting layer. Furthermore, sufficient comparative experiments have been conducted and the results show the proposed model has better ability on solving uncertainty and overfitting problems than the state-of-art methods.

Recent research has demonstrated that a framework called "decomposition and ensemble" is very powerful for energy forecasting. To improve the effectiveness of STLF, this paper proposes a novel approach integrating the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and multiple kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM), namely, ICEEMDAN-GWO-MKELM, for STLF, following this framework. The proposed ICEEMDAN-GWO-MKELM consists of three stages. First, the complex raw load data are decomposed into a couple of relatively simple components by ICEEMDAN. Second, MKELM is used to forecast each decomposed component individually. Specifically, we use GWO to optimize both the weight and the parameters of every single kernel in extreme learning machine to improve the forecasting ability. Finally, the results of all the components are aggregated as the final forecasting result. The extensive experiments reveal that the ICEEMDAN-GWO-MKELM can outperform several state-of-the-art forecasting approaches in terms of some evaluation criteria, showing that the ICEEMDAN-GWO-MKELM is very effective for STLF.

Many machine-learning-based methods, especially deep learning-based ones, have been proposed for this task. However, these methods often represent the drugs as strings, which are not a natural way to depict molecules. Also, interpretation (e.g., what are the mutation or copy number aberration contributing to the drug response) has not been considered thoroughly. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel method, GraphDRP, based on graph convolutional network for the problem. In GraphDRP, drugs were represented in molecular graphs directly capturing the bonds among atoms, meanwhile cell lines were depicted as binary vectors of genomic aberrations. Representative features of drugs and cell lines were learned by convolution layers, then combined to represent for each drug-cell line pair. Finally, the response value of each drug-cell line pair was predicted by a fully-connected neural network. Four variants of graph convolutional networks were used for learning the features of drugs. Results: We found that GraphDRP outperforms tCNNS in all performance measures for all experiments. Also, through saliency maps of the resulting GraphDRP models, we discovered the contribution of the genomic aberrations to the responses.

In this paper, based on the spatial-temporal structure of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, we develop a novel EEG-based spatial-temporal convolutional neural network (ESTCNN) to detect driver fatigue. First, we introduce the core block to extract temporal dependencies from EEG signals. Then, we employ dense layers to fuse spatial features and realize classification. The developed network could automatically learn valid features from EEC signals, which outperforms the classical two-step machine learning algorithms. Importantly, we carry out fatigue driving experiments to collect EEG signals from eight subjects being alert and fatigue states. Using 2800 samples under within-subject splitting, we compare the effectiveness of ESTCNN with eight competitive methods. The results indicate that ESTCNN fulfills a better classification accuracy of 97.37% than these compared methods. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal structure of this framework advantages in computational efficiency and reference time, which allows further implementations in the brain-computer interface online systems.

J	Dabiri, S; Heaslip, K				Dabiri, Sina; Heaslip, Kevin			Inferring transportation modes from GPS trajectories using a convolutional neural network	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; GPS data; Transportation mode Inference	TRAVEL	Identifying the distribution of users' transportation modes is an essential part of travel demand analysis and transportation planning. With the advent of ubiquitous GPS-enabled devices (e.g., a smartphone), a cost-effective approach for inferring commuters' mobility mode(s) is to leverage their GPS trajectories. A majority of studies have proposed mode inference models based on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning algorithms. However, manual features engender some major drawbacks including vulnerability to traffic and environmental conditions as well as possessing human's bias in creating efficient features. One way to overcome these issues is by utilizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) schemes that are capable of automatically driving high-level features from the raw input. Accordingly, in this paper, we take advantage of CNN architectures so as to predict travel modes based on only raw GPS trajectories, where the modes are labeled as walk, bike, bus, driving, and train. Our key contribution is designing the layout of the CNN's input layer in such a way that not only is adaptable with the CNN schemes but represents fundamental motion characteristics of a moving object including speed, acceleration, jerk, and bearing rate. Furthermore, we ameliorate the quality of GPS logs through several data preprocessing steps. Using the clean input layer, a variety of CNN configurations are evaluated to achieve the best CNN architecture. The highest accuracy of 84.8% has been achieved through the ensemble of the best CNN configuration. In this research, we contrast our methodology with traditional machine learning algorithms as well as the seminal and most related studies to demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Wearable devices, smart-phones and ambient environments devices are equipped with variety of sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometer, heart rate, pressure and wearable camera for activity detection and monitoring. These sensors are pre-processed and different feature sets such as time domain, frequency domain, wavelet transform are extracted and transform using machine learning algorithm for human activity classification and monitoring. Recently, deep learning algorithms for automatic feature representation have also been proposed to lessen the burden of reliance on handcrafted features and to increase performance accuracy. Initially, one set of sensor data, features or classifiers were used for activity recognition applications. However, there are new trends on the implementation of fusion strategies to combine sensors data, features and classifiers to provide diversity, offer higher generalization, and tackle challenging issues. For instances, combination of inertial sensors provide mechanism to differentiate activity of similar patterns and accurate posture identification while other multimodal sensor data are used for energy expenditure estimations, object localizations in smart homes and health status monitoring. Hence, the focus of this review is to provide in-depth and comprehensive analysis of data fusion and multiple classifier systems techniques for human activity recognition with emphasis on mobile and wearable devices. First, data fusion methods and modalities were presented and also feature fusion, including deep learning fusion for human activity recognition were critically analysed, and their applications, strengths and issues were identified. Furthermore, the review presents different multiple classifier system design and fusion methods that were recently proposed in literature. Finally, open research problems that require further research and improvements are identified and discussed.

AI-related research in ophthalmology previously focused on the screening and diagnosis of posterior segment diseases, particularly diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. There is now emerging evidence demonstrating the application of AI to the diagnosis and management of a variety of anterior segment conditions. In this review, we provide an overview of AI applications to the anterior segment addressing keratoconus, infectious keratitis, refractive surgery, corneal transplant, adult and paediatric cataracts, angle-closure glaucoma and iris tumour, and highlight important clinical considerations for adoption of AI technologies, potential integration with telemedicine and future directions.

However, discovering temporal patterns for event sequences clustering is rarely studied in TPP modeling. To solve this problem, we take a reinforcement learning view whereby the observed sequences are assumed to be generated from a mixture of latent policies. The purpose is to cluster the sequences with different temporal patterns into the underlying policies while learning each of the policy model. The flexibility of our model lies in: i) all the components are networks including the policy network for modeling the temporal point process; ii) to handle varying-length event sequences, we resort to inverse reinforcement learning by decomposing the observed sequence into states (RNN hidden embedding of history) and actions (time interval to next event) in order to learn a reward function, it helps to achieve better performance or increasing efficiency compared to existing methods using rewards over the entire sequence such as log-likelihood or Wasserstein distance. We adopt an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, in E-step estimating the cluster labels for each sequence, in M-step aiming to learn the respective policy. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the efficacy of our method against the state-of-the-arts.

This study assessed the feasibility of data-driven methods toward predicting the performance of a diesel engine modified to natural gas (NG) spark ignition (SI), based on a limited number of experiments. As the best ML technique cannot be chosen a priori, the applicability of different ML algorithms for such an engine application was evaluated. Specifically, the performance of two widely used ML algorithms, the random forest (RF) and the artificial neural network (ANN), in forecasting engine responses related to in-cylinder combustion phenomena was compared. The results indicated that both algorithms with spark timing (ST), mixture equivalence ratio, and engine speed as model inputs produced acceptable results with respect to predicting engine performance, combustion phasing, and engine-out emissions. Despite requiring more effort in hyperparameter optimization, the ANN model performed better than the RF model, especially for engine emissions, as evidenced by the larger R-squared, smaller root-mean-square errors (RMSEs), and more realistic predictions of the effects of key engine control variables on the engine performance. However, in applications where the combustion behavior knowledge is limited, it is recommended to use a RF model to quickly determine the appropriate number of model inputs. Consequently, using the RF model to define the model structure and then using the ANN model to improve the model's predictive capability can help to rapidly build data-driven engine combustion models.

Yet, despite this prominence, Al-is still a surprisingly fuzzy concept and a lot of questions surrounding it are still open. In this article, we analyze how Al is different from related concepts, such as the Internet of Things and big data, and suggest that Al is not one monolithic term but instead needs to be seen in a more nuanced way. This can either be achieved by looking at Al through the lens of evolutionary stages (artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super intelligence) or by focusing on different types of Al systems (analytical Al, human-inspired AI, and humanized Al). Based on this classification, we show the potential and risk of Al using a series of case studies regarding universities, corporations, and governments. Finally, we present a framework that helps organizations think about the internal and external implications of AI, which we label the Three C Model of Confidence, Change, and Control.

Massive MIMO is a reality-What is next? Five promising research directions for antenna arrays	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Massive MIMO; Future directions; Communications; Positioning and radar; Machine learning	FUNDAMENTAL LIMITS; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; PHASED-ARRAY; RADAR; WIRELESS; LOCALIZATION; CHANNEL; PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS	Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is no longer a "wild" or "promising" concept for future cellular networks-in 2018 it became a reality. Base stations (BSs) with 64 fully digital transceiver chains were commercially deployed in several countries, the key ingredients of Massive MIMO have made it into the 5G standard, the signal processing methods required to achieve unprecedented spectral efficiency have been developed, and the limitation due to pilot contamination has been resolved. Even the development of fully digital Massive MIMO arrays for mmWave frequencies-once viewed prohibitively complicated and costly-is well underway. In a few years, Massive MIMO with fully digital transceivers will be a mainstream feature at both sub-6 GHz and mmWave frequencies. In this paper, we explain how the first chapter of the Massive MIMO research saga has come to an end, while the story has just begun. The coming wide-scale deployment of BSs with massive antenna arrays opens the door to a brand new world where spatial processing capabilities are omnipresent. In addition to mobile broadband services, the antennas can be used for other communication applications, such as low-power machine-type or ultra-reliable communications, as well as non-communication applications such as radar, sensing and positioning.

This is due to the speckle noise nature of radar, leading to a less intensive use of radar rather than optical images. The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 constellation, which recently became operational, is a satellite system providing global coverage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with a 6-days revisit period at a high spatial resolution of about 20 m. These data are valuable, as they provide spatial information on agricultural crops. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for agricultural land cover mapping through the use of deep learning techniques. The analysis is carried out on multitemporal Sentinel-1 data over an area in Camargue, France. The data set was processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack from May 2017 to September 2017. We improved this radar time series dataset by exploiting temporal filtering to reduce noise, while retaining as much as possible the fine structures present in the images. We revealed that even with classical machine learning approaches (K nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machines), good performance classification could be achieved with F-measure/Accuracy greater than 86% and Kappa coefficient better than 0.82. We found that the results of the two deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifiers clearly outperformed the classical approaches. Finally, our analyses of the Camargue area results show that the same performance was obtained with two different RNN-based classifiers on the Rice class, which is the most dominant crop of this region, with a F-measure metric of 96%. These results thus highlight that in the near future these RNN-based techniques will play an important role in the analysis of remote sensing time series.

There is, however, a growing concern that research on AI could experience a lack of cumulative building of knowledge, which has overshadowed IS research previously. This study addresses this concern, by conducting a systematic literature review of AI research in IS between 2005 and 2020. The search strategy resulted in 1877 studies, of which 98 were identified as primary studies and a synthesise of key themes that are pertinent to this study is presented. In doing so, this study makes important contributions, namely (i) an identification of the current reported business value and contributions of AI, (ii) research and practical implications on the use of AI and (iii) opportunities for future AI research in the form of a research agenda.

J	DeGrave, AJ; Janizek, JD; Lee, SI				DeGrave, Alex J.; Janizek, Joseph D.; Lee, Su-In			AI for radiographic COVID-19 detection selects shortcuts over signal	NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							DEEP; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS	Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and radiologists have recently reported AI systems that accurately detect COVID-19 in chest radiographs. However, the robustness of these systems remains unclear. Using state-of-the-art techniques in explainable AI, we demonstrate that recent deep learning systems to detect COVID-19 from chest radiographs rely on confounding factors rather than medical pathology, creating an alarming situation in which the systems appear accurate, but fail when tested in new hospitals. We observe that the approach to obtain training data for these AI systems introduces a nearly ideal scenario for AI to learn these spurious 'shortcuts'. Because this approach to data collection has also been used to obtain training data for the detection of COVID-19 in computed tomography scans and for medical imaging tasks related to other diseases, our study reveals a far-reaching problem in medical-imaging AI. In addition, we show that evaluation of a model on external data is insufficient to ensure AI systems rely on medically relevant pathology, because the undesired 'shortcuts' learned by AI systems may not impair performance in new hospitals. These findings demonstrate that explainable AI should be seen as a prerequisite to clinical deployment of machine-learning healthcare models. The urgency of the developing COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of novel diagnostic approaches, many of which use machine learning. DeGrave and colleagues use explainable AI techniques to analyse a selection of these approaches and find that the methods frequently learn to identify features unrelated to the actual disease.

Modern Strategies to Assess and Breed Forest Tree Adaptation to Changing Climate	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Review						genomics of adaptation; genomic prediction; genome-wide association studies; genome-wide selection scans; assisted gene flow; machine learning; big data	ASSISTED GENE FLOW; GENOMIC PREDICTION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; COMPLEX TRAITS; ASSOCIATION GENETICS; ECOLOGICAL GENOMICS; POPULUS-TRICHOCARPA; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; SELECTION; PLANT	Studying the genetics of adaptation to new environments in ecologically and industrially important tree species is currently a major research line in the fields of plant science and genetic improvement for tolerance to abiotic stress. Specifically, exploring the genomic basis of local adaptation is imperative for assessing the conditions under which trees will successfully adapt in situ to global climate change. However, this knowledge has scarcely been used in conservation and forest tree improvement because woody perennials face major research limitations such as their outcrossing reproductive systems, long juvenile phase, and huge genome sizes. Therefore, in this review we discuss predictive genomic approaches that promise increasing adaptive selection accuracy and shortening generation intervals. They may also assist the detection of novel allelic variants from tree germplasm, and disclose the genomic potential of adaptation to different environments. For instance, natural populations of tree species invite using tools from the population genomics field to study the signatures of local adaptation. Conventional genetic markers and whole genome sequencing both help identifying genes and markers that diverge between local populations more than expected under neutrality, and that exhibit unique signatures of diversity indicative of "selective sweeps." Ultimately, these efforts inform the conservation and breeding status capable of pivoting forest health, ecosystem services, and sustainable production. Key long-term perspectives include understanding how trees' phylogeographic history may affect the adaptive relevant genetic variation available for adaptation to environmental change. Encouraging "big data" approaches (machine learning-ML) capable of comprehensively merging heterogeneous genomic and ecological datasets is becoming imperative, too.

Unreasonable lane changes can cause serious collisions and consequent traffic delays. High precision prediction of lane changing intent is helpful for improving driving safety. In this study, by fusing information from vehicle sensors, a lane changing predictor based on Adaptive Fuzzy Neural Network (AFFN) is proposed to predict steering angles. The prediction model includes two parts: fuzzy neural network based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference, in which an improved Least Squares Estimator (LSE) is adopt to optimize parameters; adaptive learning algorithm to update membership functions and rule base. Experiments are conducted in the driving simulator under scenarios with different speed levels of lead vehicle: 60 km/h, 80 km/h and 100 km/h. Prediction results show that the proposed method is able to accurately follow steering angle patterns. Furthermore, comparison of prediction performance with several machine learning methods further verifies the learning ability of the AFNN. Finally, a sensibility analysis indicates heading angles and acceleration of vehicle are also important factors for predicting lane changing behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Performance of these models was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and statistical index-based methods. Results showed that the hybrid ensemble models could significantly improve the performance of the base classifier of BLR (AUROC?=?0.930).

In the proposed method, the vibration signal is decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using empirical mode decomposition method. The fuzzy information entropy values of IMFs are calculated to reveal the intrinsic characteristics of the vibration signal and considered as feature vectors. Then the diversity mutation strategy, neighborhood mutation strategy, learning factor strategy and inertia weight strategy for basic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are used to propose an improved PSO algorithm. The improved PSO algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) in order to construct an optimal LS-SVM classifier, which is used to classify the fault. Finally, the proposed fault diagnosis method is fully evaluated by experiments and comparative studies for motor bearing. The experiment results indicate that the fuzzy information entropy can accurately and more completely extract the characteristics of the vibration signal.

A review of the -state-of-the-art in data -driven approaches for building energy prediction	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Review						Data-driven approach; Machine learning; Energy prediction; Building	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOAD FORECASTING MODELS; SHORT-TERM; COOLING LOAD; ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; HEAT LOAD; PROBABILISTIC LOAD; DEMAND PREDICTION; RANDOM FOREST	Building energy prediction plays a vital role in developing a model predictive controller for consumers and optimizing energy distribution plan for utilities. Common approaches for energy prediction include physical models, data-driven models and hybrid models. Among them, data-driven approaches have become a popular topic in recent years due to their ability to discover statistical patterns without expertise knowledge. To acquire the latest research trends, this study first summarizes the limitations of earlier reviews: seldom present comprehensive review for the entire data-driven process for building energy prediction and rarely summarize the input updating strategies when applying the trained data-driven model to multi-step energy prediction. To overcome these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review on building energy prediction, covering the entire data-driven process that includes feature engineering, potential data-driven models and expected outputs. The distribution of 105 papers, which focus on building energy prediction by data-driven approaches, are reviewed over data source, feature types, model utilization and prediction outputs. Then, in order to implement the trained data-driven models into multi-step prediction, input updating strategies are reviewed to deal with the time series property of energy related data. Finally, the review concludes with some potential future research directions based on discussion of existing research gaps. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. Allrightsreserved.

Every machine learning model is trained and evaluated using data, quite often in the form of static datasets. The characteristics of these datasets fundamentally influence a model's behavior: a model is unlikely to perform well in the wild if its deployment context does not match its training or evaluation datasets, or if these datasets reflect unwanted societal biases. Mismatches like this can have especially severe consequences when machine learning models are used in high-stakes domains, such as criminal justice,(1,13,24) hiring,(19) critical infrastructure,(11,21) and finance.(18) Even in other domains, mismatches may lead to loss of revenue or public relations setbacks. Of particular concern are recent examples showing that machine learning models can reproduce or amplify unwanted societal biases reflected in training datasets.(4,5,12) For these and other reasons, the World Economic Forum suggests all entities should document the provenance, creation, and use of machine learning datasets to avoid discriminatory outcomes.(25) Although data provenance has been studied	[Gebru, Timnit] DAIR Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA; [Morgenstern, Jamie] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Vecchione, Briana] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA; [Vaughan, Jennifer Wortman; Wallach, Hanna; Daume, Hal, III; Crawford, Kate] Microsoft Res, New York, NY USA; [Daume, Hal, III] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Crawford, Kate] USC Annenberg, Los Angeles, CA USA		Gebru, T (corresponding author), DAIR Inst, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA.								25	112	112	5	6	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA	0001-0782	1557-7317		COMMUN ACM	Commun.

One crucial aspect for this progress are novel neural architectures. Currently employed architectures have mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Because of this, there is growing interest in automated neural architecture search methods. We provide an overview of existing work in this field of research and categorize them according to three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy.

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 diagnosis on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning framework was developed using 3D CT volumes for COVID-19 classification and lesion localization. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious; the COVID-19 lesions are localized by combining the activation regions in the classification network and the unsupervised connected components. 499 CT volumes were used for training and 131 CT volumes were used for testing. Our algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability and discover lesion regions in chest CT without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

Soft thresholding is inserted as nonlinear transformation layers into the deep architectures to eliminate unimportant features. Moreover, considering that it is generally challenging to set proper values for the thresholds, the developed deep residual shrinkage networks integrate a few specialized neural networks as trainable modules to automatically determine the thresholds, so that professional expertise on signal processing is not required. The efficacy of the developed methods is validated through experiments with various types of noise.

Central to this shift is the development of artificial intelligence approaches to implementing innovative modeling based on the dynamic, heterogeneous, and large nature of drug data sets. As a result, recently developed artificial intelligence approaches such as deep learning and relevant modeling studies provide new solutions to efficacy and safety evaluations of drug candidates based on big data modeling and analysis. The resulting models provided deep insights into the continuum from chemical structure to in vitro, in vivo, and clinical outcomes. The relevant novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recent modeling studies. In summary, the new advancement of artificial intelligence in the big data era has paved the road to future rational drug development and optimization, which will have a significant impact on drug discovery procedures and, eventually, public health.

Existing state-of-the-art frameworks first encode the input image as a low-resolution representation through a subnetwork that is formed by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions in series (e.g., ResNet, VGGNet), and then recover the high-resolution representation from the encoded low-resolution representation. Instead, our proposed network, named as High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains high-resolution representations through the whole process. There are two key characteristics: (i) Connect the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel and (ii) repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions. The benefit is that the resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise. We show the superiority of the proposed HRNet in a wide range of applications, including human pose estimation, semantic segmentation, and object detection, suggesting that the HRNet is a stronger backbone for computer vision problems.

J	Ye, M; Shen, JB; Zhang, X; Yuen, PC; Chang, SF				Ye, Mang; Shen, Jianbing; Zhang, Xu; Yuen, Pong C.; Chang, Shih-Fu			Augmentation Invariant and Instance Spreading Feature for Softmax Embedding	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Task analysis; Visualization; Testing; Training; Unsupervised learning; Data mining; Unsupervised learning; instance feature; softmax embedding; embedding learning; data augmentation		Deep embedding learning plays a key role in learning discriminative feature representations, where the visually similar samples are pulled closer and dissimilar samples are pushed away in the low-dimensional embedding space. This paper studies the unsupervised embedding learning problem by learning such a representation without using any category labels. This task faces two primary challenges: mining reliable positive supervision from highly similar fine-grained classes, and generalizing to unseen testing categories. To approximate the positive concentration and negative separation properties in category-wise supervised learning, we introduce a data augmentation invariant and instance spreading feature using the instance-wise supervision. We also design two novel domain-agnostic augmentation strategies to further extend the supervision in feature space, which simulates the large batch training using a small batch size and the augmented features. To learn such a representation, we propose a novel instance-wise softmax embedding, which directly perform the optimization over the augmented instance features with the binary discrmination softmax encoding. It significantly accelerates the learning speed with much higher accuracy than existing methods, under both seen and unseen testing categories. The unsupervised embedding performs well even without pre-trained network over samples from fine-grained categories. We also develop a variant using category-wise supervision, namely category-wise softmax embedding, which achieves competitive performance over the state-of-of-the-arts, without using any auxiliary information or restrict sample mining.

J	Mou, LC; Lu, XQ; Li, XL; Zhu, XX				Mou, Lichao; Lu, Xiaoqiang; Li, Xuelong; Zhu, Xiao Xiang			Nonlocal Graph Convolutional Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Hyperspectral imaging; Convolution; Task analysis; Recurrent neural networks; Semisupervised learning; Support vector machines; Graph convolutional network (GCN); hyperspectral image classification; nonlocal graph; semisupervised learning	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Over the past few years making use of deep networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), classifying hyperspectral images has progressed significantly and gained increasing attention. In spite of being successful, these networks need an adequate supply of labeled training instances for supervised learning, which, however, is quite costly to collect. On the other hand, unlabeled data can be accessed in almost arbitrary amounts. Hence it would be conceptually of great interest to explore networks that are able to exploit labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously for hyperspectral image classification. In this article, we propose a novel graph-based semisupervised network called nonlocal graph convolutional network (nonlocal GCN). Unlike existing CNNs and RNNs that receive pixels or patches of a hyperspectral image as inputs, this network takes the whole image (including both labeled and unlabeled data) in. More specifically, a nonlocal graph is first calculated. Given this graph representation, a couple of graph convolutional layers are used to extract features. Finally, the semisupervised learning of the network is done by using a cross-entropy error over all labeled instances. Note that the nonlocal GCN is end-to-end trainable. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that compared with state-of-the-art spectral classifiers and spectral-spatial classification networks, the nonlocal GCN is able to offer competitive results and high-quality classification maps (with fine boundaries and without noisy scattered points of misclassification).

A hybrid MLP-CNN classifier for very fine resolution remotely sensed image classification	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; Multilayer perceptron; VFSR remotely sensed imagery; Fusion decision; Feature representation	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION FUSION; TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION; PANCHROMATIC IMAGERY; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; FRAMEWORK; ACCURACY; FEATURES	The contextual-based convolutional neural network (CNN) with deep architecture and pixel-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) with shallow structure are well-recognized neural network algorithms, representing the state-of-the-art deep learning method and the classical non-parametric machine learning approach, respectively. The two algorithms, which have very different behaviours, were integrated in a concise and effective way using a rule-based decision fusion approach for the classification of very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) remotely sensed imagery. The decision fusion rules, designed primarily based on the classification confidence of the CNN, reflect the generally complementary patterns of the individual classifiers. In consequence, the proposed ensemble classifier MLP-CNN harvests the complementary results acquired from the CNN based on deep spatial feature representation and from the MLP based on spectral discrimination. Meanwhile, limitations of the CNN due to the adoption of convolutional filters such as the uncertainty in object boundary partition and loss of useful fine spatial resolution detail were compensated. The effectiveness of the ensemble MLP-CNN classifier was tested in both urban and rural areas using aerial photography together with an additional satellite sensor dataset. The MLP-CNN classifier achieved promising performance, consistently outperforming the pixel-based MLP, spectral and textural-based MLP, and the contextual-based CNN in terms of classification accuracy. This research paves the way to effectively address the complicated problem of VFSR image classification. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

The rapid and accurate estimation of AGB in a non-destructive way is useful for making informed decisions on precision crop management. Previous studies have investigated vegetation indices (VIs) and canopy height metrics derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data to estimate the AGB of various crops. However, the input variables were derived either from one type of data or from different sensors onboard UAVs. Whether the combination of VIs and canopy height metrics derived from a single low-cost UAV system can improve the AGB estimation accuracy remains unclear. This study used a low-cost UAV system to acquire imagery at 30m flight altitude at critical growth stages of wheat in Rugao of eastern China. The experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 and involved 36 field plots representing variations in cultivar, nitrogen fertilization level and sowing density. We evaluated the performance of VIs, canopy height metrics and their combination for AGB estimation in wheat with the stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and three types of machine learning algorithms (support vector regression, SVR; extreme learning machine, ELM; random forest, RF).ResultsOur results demonstrated that the combination of VIs and canopy height metrics improved the estimation accuracy for AGB of wheat over the use of VIs or canopy height metrics alone. Specifically, RF performed the best among the SMLR and three machine learning algorithms regardless of using all the original variables or selected variables by the SMLR. The best accuracy (R-2=0.78, RMSE=1.34t/ha, rRMSE=28.98%) was obtained when applying RF to the combination of VIs and canopy height metrics.ConclusionsOur findings implied that an inexpensive approach consisting of the RF algorithm and the combination of RGB imagery and point cloud data derived from a low-cost UAV system at the consumer-grade level can be used to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation and have potential in the practical applications in the rapid estimation of other growth parameters.

For instance, activity recognition systems can be adopted in a smart home health care system to improve their rehabilitation processes of patients. There are various ways of using different sensors for human activity recognition in a smartly controlled environment. Among which, physical human activity recognition through wearable sensors provides valuable information about an individual's degree of functional ability and lifestyle. In this paper, we present a smartphone inertial sensors-based approach for human activity recognition. Efficient features are first extracted from raw data. The features include mean, median, autoregressive coefficients, etc. The features are further processed by a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to make them more robust. Finally, the features are trained with a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for successful activity recognition. The proposed approach was compared with traditional expression recognition approaches such as typical multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where it outperformed them.

State-of-the-art approaches have achieved remarkable segmentation accuracy on large organs, such as the liver and kidneys. However, most of these methods do not perform well on small organs, such as the pancreas, gallbladder, and adrenal glands, especially when lacking sufficient training data. This paper presents an automatic approach for small organ segmentation with limited training data using two cascaded steps-localization and segmentation. The localization stage involves the extraction of the region of interest after the registration of images to a common template and during the segmentation stage, a voxel-wise label map of the extracted region of interest is obtained and then transformed back to the original space. In the localization step, we propose to utilize a graph-based groupwise image registration method to build the template for registration so as to minimize the potential bias and avoid getting a fuzzy template. More importantly, a novel knowledge-aided convolutional neural network is proposed to improve segmentation accuracy in the second stage. This proposed network is flexible and can combine the effort of both deep learning and traditional methods, consequently achieving better segmentation relative to either of individual methods. The ISBI 2015 VISCERAL challenge dataset is used to evaluate the presented approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms cutting-edge deep learning approaches, traditional forest-based approaches, and multiatlas approaches in the segmentation of small organs.

The LSTM-based AE network (LSTM-AE) is used to learn the features from ECG arrhythmias signals, and the SVM is used to classify those signals from the learned features. The LSTM-AE consists of an encoder model, which extracts high-level feature information from ECG arrhythmias signals through LSTM network, and a decoder model which outputs reconstruct ECG arrhythmias signals from high-level features through LSTM network. Experiments show that the proposed method can learn better features than the traditional method without any prior knowledge, presenting a good potential for the ECG arrhythmias classification. In the classification of five heartbeats types, including normal, left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), atrial premature complexes (APC), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), the proposed method achieved average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.74%;, 99.35%;, and 99.84%;, respectively, in the beat-based cross-validation approach, and 85.20%;, 62.99%;, and 90.75%;, respectively, in the record-based cross-validation approach, in public MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. While based on the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards, the proposed method achieved average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.45%;, 98.63%;, and 99.66%;, respectively, in the beat-based cross-validation approach.

They operate for prolong hours and under different working conditions which may increase their probability of failure. Sudden failure of a gearbox may lead to significant downtime and increase maintenance costs. In industrial applications, usually fault detection and diagnosis techniques based on vibration signal are used for monitoring the health condition of gearboxes. In most of these techniques, time and frequency domain features are manually extracted from a vibration sensor and used for fault detection and diagnosis. In this research, a fault diagnosis methodology based on motor current signature analysis is proposed. The acquired data from multiple current sensors are fused by a novel 2-D convolutional neural network architecture and used for classification purpose directly without any need for manual feature extraction. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on the motor current data obtained from an industrial gearbox test rig in various health condition and with different working speeds.

J	Dong, YN; Liang, TY; Zhang, YX; Du, B				Dong, Yanni; Liang, Tianyang; Zhang, Yuxiang; Du, Bo			Spectral-Spatial Weighted Kernel Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment for Remote Sensing Image Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Remote sensing; Kernel; Manifolds; Distortion; Support vector machines; Principal component analysis; Learning systems; Classification; Grassmann manifold; remote sensing; spatial and spectral information; transfer learning; weighted kernel	DOMAIN-ADAPTATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Feature distortions of data are a typical problem in remote sensing image classification, especially in the area of transfer learning. In addition, many transfer learning-based methods only focus on spectral information and fail to utilize spatial information of remote sensing images. To tackle these problems, we propose spectral-spatial weighted kernel manifold embedded distribution alignment (SSWK-MEDA) for remote sensing image classification. The proposed method applies a novel spatial information filter to effectively use similarity between nearby sample pixels and avoid the influence of nonsample pixels. Then, a complex kernel combining spatial kernel and spectral kernel with different weights is constructed to adaptively balance the relative importance of spectral and spatial information of the remote sensing image. Finally, we utilize the geometric structure of features in manifold space to solve the problem of feature distortions of remote sensing data in transfer learning scenarios. SSWK-MEDA provides a novel approach for the combination of transfer learning and remote sensing image characteristics. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method is more effective than several state-of-the-art methods.

To reduce the dimension of the feature set while maintaining the accuracy of the performance is the main aim of the feature selection problem. Various methods have been developed to classify the datasets. However, metaheuristic algorithms have achieved great attention in solving numerous optimization problem. Therefore, this paper presents an extensive literature review on solving feature selection problem using metaheuristic algorithms which are developed in the ten years (2009-2019). Further, metaheuristic algorithms have been classified into four categories based on their behaviour. Moreover, a categorical list of more than a hundred metaheuristic algorithms is presented. To solve the feature selection problem, only binary variants of metaheuristic algorithms have been reviewed and corresponding to their categories, a detailed description of them explained. The metaheuristic algorithms in solving feature selection problem are given with their binary classification, name of the classifier used, datasets and the evaluation metrics. After reviewing the papers, challenges and issues are also identified in obtaining the best feature subset using different metaheuristic algorithms. Finally, some research gaps are also highlighted for the researchers who want to pursue their research in developing or modifying metaheuristic algorithms for classification. For an application, a case study is presented in which datasets are adopted from the UCI repository and numerous metaheuristic algorithms are employed to obtain the optimal feature subset.

Here, we present a structure-based machine learning platform for diverse applications in organic chemistry. Therefore, an input based on multiple fingerprint features (MFFs) as a versatile molecular representation was developed that was shown to be applicable over a range of diverse problem sets. First, molecular properties across a diverse array of molecules could be predicted accurately. Next, reaction outcomes such as stereoselectivities and yields were predicted for experimental datasets that were previously evaluated using (complex) problem-oriented descriptor models. As a final application, a systematic high-throughput dataset was investigated as a "real-world problem," and good correlation was observed when using the structure-based model.

However, large-scale high-speed retrieval through binary code has a certain degree of reduction in retrieval accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods. We have noticed that multi-view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data. Therefore, we try to introduce the multi-view deep neural network into the hash learning field, and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model, which has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a supervised multi-view hash model which can enhance the multi-view information through neural networks. This is a completely new hash learning method that combines multi-view and deep learning methods. The proposed method utilizes an effective view stability evaluation method to actively explore the relationship among views, which will affect the optimization direction of the entire network. We have also designed a variety of multi-data fusion methods in the Hamming space to preserve the advantages of both convolution and multi-view. In order to avoid excessive computing resources on the enhancement procedure during retrieval, we set up a separate structure called memory network which participates in training together. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO datasets, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view hashing methods.

Machine learning (ML) is one of intelligent technique that able to automatically predict the event with reasonable accuracy based on the experience and learning process. In the meantime, a rapid number of ML models have been proposed for predicate the cases of COVID-19. Thus, there is need for an evaluation and benchmarking of COVID-19 ML models which considered the main challenge of this study. Furthermore, there is no single study have addressed the problem of evaluation and benchmarking of COVID diagnosis models. However, this study proposed an intelligent methodology is to help the health organisations in the selection COVID-19 diagnosis system. The benchmarking and evaluation of diagnostic models for COVID-19 is not a trivial process. There are multiple criteria requires to evaluate and some of the criteria are conflicting with each other. Our study is formulated as a decision matrix (DM) that embedded mix of ten evaluation criteria and twelve diagnostic models for COVID-19. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is employed to evaluate and benchmarking the different diagnostic models for COVID19 with respect to the evaluation criteria. An integrated MCDM method are proposed where TOPSIS applied for the benchmarking and ranking purpose while Entropy used to calculate the weights of criteria. The study results revealed that the benchmarking and selection problems associated with COVID19 diagnosis models can be effectively solved using the integration of Entropy and TOPSIS. The SVM (linear) classifier is selected as the best diagnosis model for COVID19 with the closeness coefficient value of 0.9899 for our case study data. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has solved the significant variance for each criterion in terms of ideal best and worst best value, beside issue when specific diagnosis models have same ideal best value.

The practice of mathematics involves discovering patterns and using these to formulate and prove conjectures, resulting in theorems. Since the 1960s, mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and formulation of conjectures(1), most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture(2), a Millennium Prize Problem(3). Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning-demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups(4). Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.

Notably, the complex characteristics, i.e., the nonlinear relation among the captured spectral information and the corresponding object of HSI data, make accurate classification challenging for traditional methods. In the last few years, deep learning (DL) has been substantiated as a powerful feature extractor that effectively addresses the nonlinear problems that appeared in a number of computer vision tasks. This prompts the deployment of DL for HSI classification (HSIC) which revealed good performance. This survey enlists a systematic overview of DL for HSIC and compared state-of-the-art strategies of the said topic. Primarily, we will encapsulate the main challenges of TML for HSIC and then we will acquaint the superiority of DL to address these problems. This article breaks down the state-of-the-art DL frameworks into spectral-features, spatial-features, and together spatial-spectral features to systematically analyze the achievements (future research directions as well) of these frameworks for HSIC. Moreover, we will consider the fact that DL requires a large number of labeled training examples whereas acquiring such a number for HSIC is challenging in terms of time and cost. Therefore, this survey discusses some strategies to improve the generalization performance of DL strategies which can provide some future guidelines.

J	Zhang, CJ; Zuo, RG; Xiong, YH				Zhang, Chunjie; Zuo, Renguang; Xiong, Yihui			Detection of the multivariate geochemical anomalies associated with mineralization using a deep convolutional neural network and a pixel-pair feature method	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Geochemical anomalies; Mineral exploration; Pixel-pair feature method; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network	MAKENG FE DEPOSIT; MACHINE; IDENTIFICATION	Machine learning (ML) algorithms are widely applied in various fields owing to their strong ability to abstract high-level features from a large number of training samples. However, few supervised ML algorithms have been applied in geochemical prospecting and mineral exploration because mineralization is a rare geological event that leads to an insufficient number of training samples. Generating a large number of training samples is crucial for the application of supervised ML in geochemical prospecting and mineral exploration. In this study, a novel anomaly detection framework combined with a pixel-pair feature (PPF) method and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to identify the multivariate geochemical anomalies associated with mineralization. First, the PPF method was employed to generate sufficient training samples by recombining the pixel pairs of the labeled samples. Then, a multilayer supervised CNN framework, which consists of 13 convolutional layers, an average pooling layer, and a fully connected layer, was trained with these pixel pairs for geochemical anomaly recognition. The testing procedure was based on the fact that neighboring pixels belong to the same class with a high probability. The dual-window detector was applied to detect multivariate geochemical anomalies related to Fe polymetallic mineralization in the southwest Fujian Province of China. The identified geochemical anomalies exhibited a close spatial correlation with the known mineral deposits, which validates the potential of the proposed method. Therefore, the method developed in this study can enhance the application of supervised ML in geochemical prospecting and mineral exploration.

Application of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Review						big data; clinical decision making; dental; informatics; machine learning; neural networks		Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that utilizes machines to mimic intelligent human behavior. To appreciate human-technology interaction in the clinical setting, augmented intelligence has been proposed as a cognitive extension of AI in health care, emphasizing its assistive and supplementary role to medical professionals. While truly autonomous medical robotic systems are still beyond reach, the virtual component of AI, known as software-type algorithms, is the main component used in dentistry. Because of their powerful capabilities in data analysis, these virtual algorithms are expected to improve the accuracy and efficacy of dental diagnosis, provide visualized anatomic guidance for treatment, simulate and evaluate prospective results, and project the occurrence and prognosis of oral diseases. Potential obstacles in contemporary algorithms that prevent routine implementation of AI include the lack of data curation, sharing, and readability; the inability to illustrate the inner decision-making process; the insufficient power of classical computing; and the neglect of ethical principles in the design of AI frameworks. It is necessary to maintain a proactive attitude toward AI to ensure its affirmative development and promote human-technology rapport to revolutionize dental practice. The present review outlines the progress and potential dental applications of AI in medical-aided diagnosis, treatment, and disease prediction and discusses their data limitations, interpretability, computing power, and ethical considerations, as well as their impact on dentists, with the objective of creating a backdrop for future research in this rapidly expanding arena.

To handle such types of complex problems, one type of feature descriptor is not enough. To overcome these issues, this paper proposed a multi-model recognition and classification strategy using multifeature fusion approaches. One of the growing topics in computer and machine vision is fruit and vegetable identification and categorization. A fruit identification system may be employed to assist customers and purchasers in identifying the species and quality of fruit. Using Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning applications, a multi-model fruit image identification system was created. For performance assessment in terms of accuracy analysis, the proposed framework is compared to ANFIS, RNN, CNN, and RNN-CNN. The motivation for adopting deep learning is that these models categorize pictures without the need for any intervention or process. The suggested fruit recognition method offers efficient and promising results, according to the findings of the experiments in terms of accuracy and F-measure performance analysis.

Assess or predict landslide-susceptible the landslide displacement through monitoring are great beneficial to guide landslide control and mitigate these hazards by taking appropriate preparatory measures. In this paper, a new water cycle algorithm optimization BP neural network (BPNN) dynamic prediction model (WCA-BPNN) was established to make up for the shortcoming of BPNN convergence speed. A typical step-wise landslide--Langshuwan Landslide happened in the Three Gorges Reservoir area of China is taken as a case, and the displacement monitoring data of 4 years was used for time series analysis and modeling. The long-term creep effect of the landslide and the short-term acceleration effect of the climate are considered in the model, and the accumulative displacement is divided into two kinds of trend displacement and periodic displacement. The key influencing factors of landslide periodic displacement were screened by gray relational grade analysis method, and then used as learning data. In addition to comparing the predicted value of the model with the measured value, it also compares the accuracy of the three models of BPNN, support vector machine, extreme learning machine under the training conditions of the same learning data set. The results show that the WAC-BPNN model has faster convergence speed and higher prediction accuracy than the traditional BPNN model, and it is also the most accurate of the four models.

The aim of the present research is to critically review the existing literature on different spatial approaches through which researchers handle the dimension of space in its various aspects in their studies and analyses. Specifically, the use of different areal unit levels in spatial road safety studies is investigated, different modelling approaches are discussed, and the corresponding study design characteristics are summarized in respective tables including traffic, road environment and area parameters and spatial aggregation approaches. Developments in famous issues in spatial analysis such as the boundary problem, the modifiable areal unit problem and spatial proximity structures are also discussed. Studies focusing on spatially analyzing vulnerable road users are reviewed as well. Regarding spatial models, the application, advantages and disadvantages of various functional/econometric approaches, Bayesian models and machine learning methods are discussed. Based on the reviewed studies, present challenges and future research directions are determined.

First, the feature normalization method is used to smooth the feature data to eliminate the influence of too large or too small feature values on the model's classification performance. Secondly, the oversampling method is used to expand and sample the data, which solves the unbalanced classification of labelled samples. Finally, the Tri-training algorithm performs machine learning on the training samples and establishes a defect prediction model. The novelty of this model is that it can effectively combine feature normalization, oversampling techniques, and the Tri-training algorithm to solve both the under-labelled sample and class imbalance problems. Simulation experiments using the NASA software defect prediction dataset show that the proposed method outperforms four existing supervised and semi-supervised learning in terms of Precision, Recall, and F-Measure values.

Fully Automated Echocardiogram Interpretation in Clinical Practice: Feasibility and Diagnostic Accuracy	CIRCULATION			English	Article						diagnosis; echocardiography; machine learning	VIEW CLASSIFICATION; UNITED-STATES; DEEP; ASSOCIATION; DISEASE; CANCER	Background: Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform clinical practice in multiple ways, including enabling serial assessment of cardiac function by nonexperts in primary care and rural settings. We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram interpretation, including (1) view identification, (2) image segmentation, (3) quantification of structure and function, and (4) disease detection. Methods: Using 14035 echocardiograms spanning a 10-year period, we trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models for multiple tasks, including automated identification of 23 viewpoints and segmentation of cardiac chambers across 5 common views. The segmentation output was used to quantify chamber volumes and left ventricular mass, determine ejection fraction, and facilitate automated determination of longitudinal strain through speckle tracking. Results were evaluated through comparison to manual segmentation and measurements from 8666 echocardiograms obtained during the routine clinical workflow. Finally, we developed models to detect 3 diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Results: Convolutional neural networks accurately identified views (eg, 96% for parasternal long axis), including flagging partially obscured cardiac chambers, and enabled the segmentation of individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (eg, median absolute deviations of 15% to 17% of observed values for left ventricular mass, left ventricular diastolic volume, and left atrial volume). In terms of function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values (for ejection fraction, median absolute deviation=9.7% of observed, N=6407 studies; for strain, median absolute deviation=7.5%, n=419, and 9.0%, n=110) and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of patients with breast cancer for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found automated measurements to be comparable or superior to manual measurements across 11 internal consistency metrics (eg, the correlation of left atrial and ventricular volumes). Finally, we trained convolutional neural networks to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension with C statistics of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively. Conclusions: Our pipeline lays the groundwork for using automated interpretation to support serial patient tracking and scalable analysis of millions of echocardiograms archived within healthcare systems.

However, due to the uncertainty and volatility of wind speed, wind energy cannot be effectively exploited, and it is essential to build an accurate wind speed forecasting model. In this paper, a Jaya algorithm-based support vector machine (Jaya-SVM) model is proposed for short-term wind speed forecasting. Different from the typical SVM regression, the most representative features of input data are selected and the hyper-parameters of SVM are optimized by using the Jaya optimization algorithm. To examine the performance of the Jaya-SVM model, seven other wind speed forecasting models, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Extreme Gradient Boosting model, Multi-Layer Perceptron Regression model, Deep Belief Network, Gaussian Process Regression, Stacked Sparse Autoencoder and Granular Computing method are employed for comparison. The wind speed data collected in Jilin, China is fully utilized. The computational results demonstrate that the Jaya-SVM model generates the best results among all eight models in terms of MAE, MSE, MAPE, R-2 and reliability, having the capacity of accurate wind speed forecasting.

Efficiency fosters cumulative culture across species	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						social learning; cultural evolution; animal culture; efficiency; complexity	TOOL USE; CAPUCHIN MONKEYS; DIFFUSION ANALYSIS; WILD CHIMPANZEES; ANIMAL CULTURES; MATE-CHOICE; EVOLUTION; COMPLEXITY; SONG; TRANSMISSION	Recent studies in several taxa have demonstrated that animal culture can evolve to become more efficient in various contexts ranging from tool use to route learning and migration. Under recent definitions, such increases in efficiency might satisfy the core criteria of cumulative cultural evolution (CCE). However, there is not yet a satisfying consensus on the precise definition of efficiency, CCE or the link between efficiency and more complex, extended forms of CCE considered uniquely human. To bring clarity to this wider discussion of CCE, we develop the concept of efficiency by (i) reviewing recent potential evidence for CCE in animals, and (ii) clarifying a useful definition of efficiency by synthesizing perspectives found within the literature, including animal studies and the wider iterated learning literature. Finally, (iii) we discuss what factors might impinge on the informational bottleneck of social transmission, and argue that this provides pressure for learnable behaviours across species. We conclude that framing CCE in terms of efficiency casts complexity in a new light, as learnable behaviours are a requirement for the evolution of complexity. Understanding how efficiency greases the ratchet of cumulative culture provides a better appreciation of how similar cultural evolution can be between taxonomically diverse species-a case for continuity across the animal kingdom. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.

J	Qu, Y; Baghbaderani, RK; Qi, HR; Kwan, C				Qu, Ying; Baghbaderani, Razieh Kaviani; Qi, Hairong; Kwan, Chiman			Unsupervised Pansharpening Based on Self-Attention Mechanism	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Spatial resolution; Image reconstruction; Sensors; Satellites; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Attention mechanism; multispectral image (MSI); pansharpening; unsupervised deep learning	FUSION; REGRESSION; INFORMATION; IMAGES; MS	Pansharpening is to fuse a multispectral image (MSI) of low-spatial-resolution (LR) but rich spectral characteristics with a panchromatic image (PAN) of high spatial resolution (HR) but poor spectral characteristics. Traditional methods usually inject the extracted high-frequency details from PAN into the upsampled MSI. Recent deep learning endeavors are mostly supervised assuming that the HR MSI is available, which is unrealistic especially for satellite images. Nonetheless, these methods could not fully exploit the rich spectral characteristics in the MSI. Due to the wide existence of mixed pixels in satellite images where each pixel tends to cover more than one constituent material, pansharpening at the subpixel level becomes essential. In this article, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening (UP) method in a deep-learning framework to address the abovementioned challenges based on the self-attention mechanism (SAM), referred to as UP-SAM. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, the SAM is proposed where the spatial varying detail extraction and injection functions are estimated according to the attention representations indicating spectral characteristics of the MSI with subpixel accuracy. Second, such attention representations are derived from mixed pixels with the proposed stacked attention network powered with a stick-breaking structure to meet the physical constraints of mixed pixel formulations. Third, the detail extraction and injection functions are spatial varying based on the attention representations, which largely improves the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to reconstruct sharper MSI of different types, with more details and less spectral distortion compared with the state-of-the-art.

Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Lithium-ion battery; remaining useful life; deep learning; long short-term memory; Monte Carlo simulation	PROGNOSTICS; DEGRADATION; MECHANISMS; MODEL	Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion batteries can assess the battery reliability to determine the advent of failure and mitigate battery risk. The existing RUL prediction techniques for lithium-ion batteries are inefficient for learning the long-term dependencies among the capacity degradations. This paper investigates deep-learning-enabled battery RUL prediction. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed to learn the long-term dependencies among the degraded capacities of lithium-ion batteries. The LSTM RNN is adaptively optimized using the resilient mean square back propagation method, and a dropout technique is used to address the overfitting problem. The developed LSTM RNN is able to capture the underlying long-term dependencies among the degraded capacities and construct an explicitly capacity-oriented RUI, predictor, whose long-term learning performance is contrasted to the support vector machine model, the particle filter model, and the simple RNN model. Monte Carlo simulation is combined to generate a probabilistic RUL prediction. Experimental data from multiple lithium-ion cells at two different temperatures is deployed for model construction, verification, and comparison. The developed method is able to predict the battery's RUL independent of offline training data, and when some offline data is available, the RUL can he predicted earlier than in the traditional methods.

However, most of the previous studies attempting to build traffic flow forecasting models focus on short-term forecasting as the next step. In this paper, a deep feature leaning approach is proposed to predict short-term traffic flow in the following multiple steps using supervised learning techniques. To achieve traffic flow forecasting for the next day, an advanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize some parameters in deep belief networks. The modified model can boost the accuracy of the forecasting results and enhance its multiple step prediction ability. Using real-time and historical temporal-spatial traffic data, dayahead prediction experiment is implemented. The results of the hybrid model are compared with several commonly used benchmark models and some improved deep neural network based on evaluation criteria. Also, the proposed optimization algorithm is compared with the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the significance in the number of hidden layers is analyzed. When the layers are increasing more than 4, the performance of the proposed model stops improving significantly. The results indicate the proposed model can extract complex features of traffic flow and therefore the forecasting accuracy and stability can be effectively improved. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Onishi, M; Ise, T				Onishi, Masanori; Ise, Takeshi			Explainable identification and mapping of trees using UAV RGB image and deep learning	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SPECIES CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; IKONOS	The identification and mapping of trees via remotely sensed data for application in forest management is an active area of research. Previously proposed methods using airborne and hyperspectral sensors can identify tree species with high accuracy but are costly and are thus unsuitable for small-scale forest managers. In this work, we constructed a machine vision system for tree identification and mapping using Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this system, we first calculated the slope from the three-dimensional model obtained by the UAV, and segmented the UAV RGB photograph of the forest into several tree crown objects automatically using colour and three-dimensional information and the slope model, and lastly applied object-based CNN classification for each crown image. This system succeeded in classifying seven tree classes, including several tree species with more than 90% accuracy. The guided gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) showed that the CNN classified trees according to their shapes and leaf contrasts, which enhances the potential of the system for classifying individual trees with similar colours in a cost-effective manner-a useful feature for forest management.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs using MALDI-MS	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MASS-SPECTROMETRY; R-PACKAGE; DIFFERENTIATION	SARS-CoV-2 is reliably detected in nasal swab samples using mass spectrometry and machine learning analysis. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR and other advanced methods can achieve high accuracy. However, their application is limited in countries that lack sufficient resources to handle large-scale testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we describe a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and machine learning analysis. This approach uses equipment and expertise commonly found in clinical laboratories in developing countries. We obtained mass spectra from a total of 362 samples (211 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 151 negative by RT-PCR) without prior sample preparation from three different laboratories. We tested two feature selection methods and six machine learning approaches to identify the top performing analysis approaches and determine the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The support vector machine model provided the highest accuracy (93.9%), with 7% false positives and 5% false negatives. Our results suggest that MALDI-MS and machine learning analysis can be used to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab samples.

Here, we employ an artificial neural network and deep-learning techniques to identify quantum phase transitions from single-shot experimental momentum-space density images of ultracold quantum gases and obtain results that were not feasible with conventional methods. We map out the complete two-dimensional topological phase diagram of the Haldane models(5-7) and provide an improved characterization of the superfluid-to-Mott-insulator transition in an inhomogeneous Bose-Hubbard systems(8-10). Our work points the way to unravel complex phase diagrams of general experimental systems, where the Hamiltonian and the order parameters might not be known.

The realization of those functions requires efficient reservoir operation, and the effective controls on the outflow from a reservoir or dam. Over the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular in the field of streamflow forecasts, reservoir operation planning and scheduling approaches. In this study, three AI models, namely, the backpropagation (BP) neural network, support vector regression (SVR) technique, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are employed to simulate reservoir operation at monthly, daily, and hourly time scales, using approximately 30 years of historical reservoir operation records. This study aims to summarize the influence of the parameter settings on model performance and to explore the applicability of the LSTM model to reservoir operation simulation. The results show the following: (1) for the BP neural network and LSTM model, the effects of the number of maximum iterations on model performance should be prioritized; for the SVR model, the simulation performance is directly related to the selection of the kernel function, and sigmoid and RBF kernel functions should be prioritized; (2) the BP neural network and SVR are suitable for the model to learn the operation rules of a reservoir from a small amount of data; and (3) the LSTM model is able to effectively reduce the time consumption and memory storage required by other AI models, and demonstrate good capability in simulating low-flow conditions and the outflow curve for the peak operation period.

J	Gao, H; Sun, LN; Wang, JX				Gao, Han; Sun, Luning; Wang, Jian-Xun			PhyGeoNet: Physics-informed geometry-adaptive convolutional neural networks for solving parameterized steady-state PDEs on irregular domain	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Physics-informed neural networks; Label-free; Surrogate modeling; Physics-constrained deep learning; Partial differential equations; Navier-Stokes	UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK; FIELDS	Recently, the advent of deep learning has spurred interest in the development of physics informed neural networks (PINN) for efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in a parametric setting. Among all different classes of deep neural networks, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has attracted increasing attention in the scientific machine learning community, since the parameter-sharing feature in CNN enables efficient learning for problems with large-scale spatiotemporal fields. However, one of the biggest challenges is that CNN only can handle regular geometries with image like format (i.e., rectangular domains with uniform grids). In this paper, we propose a novel physics-constrained CNN learning architecture, aiming to learn solutions of parametric PDEs on irregular domains without any labeled data. In order to leverage powerful classic CNN backbones, elliptic coordinate mapping is introduced to enable coordinate transforms between the irregular physical domain and regular reference domain. The proposed method has been assessed by solving a number of steady-state PDEs on irregular domains, including heat equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and Poisson equations with parameterized boundary conditions, varying geometries, and spatially-varying source fields. Moreover, the proposed method has also been compared against the state-of-the-art PINN with fully-connected neural network (FC-NN) formulation. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and exhibit notable superiority over the FC-NN based PINN in terms of efficiency and accuracy. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

To solve the sparse high-dimensional matrix computation problem of texts data, a deep belief network is introduced. After the feature extraction with DBN, softmax regression is employed to classify the text in the learned feature space. In pre-training procedures, the deep belief network and softmax regression are first trained, respectively. Then, in the fine-tuning stage, they are transformed into a coherent whole and the system parameters are optimized with Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. The experimental results on Reuters-21,578 and 20-Newsgroup corpus show that the proposed model can converge at fine-tuning stage and perform significantly better than the classical algorithms, such as SVM and KNN.

The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google's computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the "big picture" of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90% of studies while 10% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.

Among common bone diseases are osteoporosis and Paget's, two of the most frequently found diseases in the elderly. Nowadays, a combination of multiple drugs is the optimal therapy to decelerate osteoporosis and Paget's pathologic process, which comes with various underlying adverse effects due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to evaluate the interaction, pharmacodynamics, and possible side effects between drugs. In this research, we created an AI-based machine-learning model to predict the outcomes of interactions between drugs used for osteoporosis and Paget's treatment, which helps mitigate the cost and time to implement the best combination of medications in clinical practice. In this study, a DDI dataset was collected from the DrugBank database within the osteoporosis and Paget diseases. We then extracted a variety of chemical features from the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) of defined drug pairs that interact with each other. Finally, machine-learning algorithms were implemented to learn the extracted features. Our stack ensemble model from Random Forest and XGBoost reached an average accuracy of 74 % in predicting DDIs. It was superior to individual models as well as previous methods in terms of most measurement metrics. This study showed the potential of AI models in predicting DDIs of Osteoporosis-Paget's disease in particular, and other diseases in general.

However, such methods have many limitations that arise from the use of traditional random walks, e.g., the embeddings resulting from these methods capture proximity (communities) among the vertices as opposed to structural similarity (roles). Furthermore, the embeddings are unable to transfer to new nodes and graphs as they are tied to node identity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Role2Vec framework based on the proposed notion of attributed random walks to learn structural role-based embeddings. Notably, the framework serves as a basis for generalizing any walk-based method. The Role2Vec framework enables these methods to be more widely applicable by learning inductive functions that capture the structural roles in the graph. Furthermore, the original methods are recovered as a special case of the framework when each vertex is mapped to its own function that uniquely identifies it. Finally, the Role2Vec framework is shown to be effective with an average AUC improvement of 17.8 percent for link prediction while requiring on average 853x less space than existing methods on a variety of graphs from different domains.

We present the following four principal contributions. First, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is trainable in an end-to-end manner directly for the place recognition task. The main component of this architecture, NetVLAD, is a new generalized VLAD layer, inspired by the "Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors" image representation commonly used in image retrieval. The layer is readily pluggable into any CNN architecture and amenable to training via backpropagation. Second, we create a new weakly supervised ranking loss, which enables end-to-end learning of the architecture's parameters from images depicting the same places over time downloaded from Google Street View Time Machine. Third, we develop an efficient training procedure which can be applied on very large-scale weakly labelled tasks. Finally, we show that the proposed architecture and training procedure significantly outperform non-learnt image representations and off-the-shelf CNN descriptors on challenging place recognition and image retrieval benchmarks.

Such constraints are often imposed as soft penalties during model training and effectively act as domain-specific regularizers of the empirical risk loss. Physics-informed neural networks is an example of this philosophy in which the outputs of deep neural networks are constrained to approximately satisfy a given set of partial differential equations. In this work we review recent advances in scientific machine learning with a specific focus on the effectiveness of physics-informed neural networks in predicting outcomes of physical systems and discovering hidden physics from noisy data. We also identify and analyze a fundamental mode of failure of such approaches that is related to numerical stiffness leading to unbalanced back-propagated gradients during model training. To address this limitation we present a learning rate annealing algorithm that utilizes gradient statistics during model training to balance the interplay between different terms in composite loss functions. We also propose a novel neural network architecture that is more resilient to such gradient pathologies. Taken together, our developments provide new insights into the training of constrained neural networks and consistently improve the predictive accuracy of physics-informed neural networks by a factor of 50-100x across a range of problems in computational physics.

Accurate Classification of Diminutive Colorectal Polyps Using Computer-Aided Analysis	GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						Colon Cancer Detection; Machine Learning; Cost-effectiveness; Magnifying	CONVENTIONAL COLONOSCOPY; OPTICAL MAGNIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; HISTOLOGY; CANCER; SYSTEM; CHROMOENDOSCOPY; POLYPECTOMY; PREVENTION; STRATEGY	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Narrow-band imaging is an image-enhanced form of endoscopy used to observed microstructures and capillaries of the mucosal epithelium which allows for real-time prediction of histologic features of colorectal polyps. However, narrow-band imaging expertise is required to differentiate hyperplastic from neoplastic polyps with high levels of accuracy. We developed and tested a system of computer-aided diagnosis with a deep neural network (DNN-CAD) to analyze narrow-band images of diminutive colorectal polyps. METHODS: We collected 1476 images of neoplastic polyps and 681 images of hyperplastic polyps, obtained from the picture archiving and communications system database in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. Histologic findings from the polyps were also collected and used as the reference standard. The images and data were used to train the DNN. A test set of images (96 hyperplastic and 188 neoplastic polyps, smaller than 5 mm), obtained from patients who underwent colonoscopies from March 2017 through August 2017, was then used to test the diagnostic ability of the DNN-CAD vs endoscopists (2 expert and 4 novice), who were asked to classify the images of the test set as neoplastic or hyperplastic. Their classifications were compared with findings from histologic analysis. The primary outcome measures were diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic time. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic time were compared among DNN-CAD, the novice endoscopists, and the expert endoscopists. The study was designed to detect a difference of 10% in accuracy by a 2-sided McNemar test. RESULTS: In the test set, the DNN-CAD identified neoplastic or hyperplastic polyps with 96.3% sensitivity, 78.1% specificity, a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%. Fewer than half of the novice endoscopists classified polyps with a NPV of 90% (their NPVs ranged from 73.9% to 84.0%). DNN-CAD classified polyps as neoplastic or hyperplastic in 0.45 +/- 0.07 seconds-shorter than the time required by experts (1.54 +/- 1.30 seconds) and nonexperts (1.77 +/- 1.37 seconds) (both P < .001). DNN-CAD classified polyps with perfect intra-observer agreement (kappa score of 1). There was a low level of intra-observer and inter-observer agreement in classification among endoscopists. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a system called DNN-CAD to identify neoplastic or hyperplastic colorectal polyps less than 5 mm. The system classified polyps with a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%, and in a shorter time than endoscopists. This deep-learning model has potential for not only endoscopic image recognition but for other forms of medical image analysis, including sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance images.

J	Liu, F; Zhang, GQ; Lu, J				Liu, Feng; Zhang, Guangquan; Lu, Jie			Multisource Heterogeneous Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Fuzzy Relation Neural Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; domain adaptation; machine learning; transfer learning	PLANE GEOMETRY; SIMILARITY; REGRESSION; SYSTEM; MODEL	In unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), a classifier for a target domain is trained with labeled source data and unlabeled target data. Existing UDA methods assume that the source data come from the same source domain (i.e., single-source scenario) or from multiple source domains, whose feature spaces have the same dimension (homogeneous) but different distributions (i.e., multihomogeneous-source scenario). However, in the real world, for a specific target domain, we probably have multiple different-dimension (heterogeneous) source domains, which do not satisfy the assumption of existing UDA methods. To remove this assumption and move forward to a realistic UDA problem, this article presents a shared-fuzzy-equivalence-relation neural network (SFERNN) for addressing the multisource heterogeneous UDA problem. The SFERNN is a five-layer neural network containing c source branches and one target branch. The network structure of the SFERNN is first confirmed by a novel fuzzy relation called multisource shared fuzzy equivalence relation. Then, we optimize parameters of the SFERNN via minimizing cross-entropy loss on c source branches and the distributional discrepancy between each source branch and the target branch.

Ultrasonic guided wave based structural damage detection and localization using model assisted convolutional and recurrent neural networks	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ultrasonic guided waves; Inverse problem; Spectral element method; Model assisted approach; Damage identification; Deep learning	IDENTIFICATION; DELAMINATION; ELEMENT	The inverse problem of damage identification involves real-time, continuous observation of structures to detect any undesired, abnormal behavior and ultrasonic guided waves are considered as one of the preferred candidates for this. A parallel implementation of a reduced-order spectral finite element model is utilized to formulate the forward problem in an isotropic and a composite waveguide. In this work, along with a time-series dataset, a 2D representation of continuous wavelet transformation based time-frequency dataset is also developed. The datasets are corrupted with several levels of Gaussian random noise to incorporate different kinds of uncertainties and noise present in the real scenario. Deep learning networks like convolutional and recurrent neural networks are utilized to numerically approximate the solution of the inverse problem. A hybrid strategy of classification and regression in a supervised setting is proposed for combined damage detection and localization. The performance of the networks is compared based on metrics like accuracy, loss value, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and coefficient of determination. The predictions from conventional machine learning algorithms, trained on feature engineered dataset are compared with the deep learning algorithms. The generalization of the trained deep networks on different excitation frequencies and a higher level of uncertainties is also highlighted in this work.

There are several scientific and medical approaches to screen and detect this disease, but most of the detection is done using retinal fungal imaging. The present study uses principal component analysis based deep neural network model using Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to classify the extracted features of diabetic retinopathy dataset. The use of GWO enables to choose optimal parameters for training the DNN model. The steps involved in this paper include standardization of the diabetic retinopathy dataset using a standardscaler normalization method, followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA, then choosing of optimal hyper parameters by GWO and finally training of the dataset using a DNN model. The proposed model is evaluated based on the performance measures namely accuracy, recall, sensitivity and specificity. The model is further compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms-support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree and XGBoost. The results show that the proposed model offers better performance compared to the aforementioned algorithms.

J	Gao, YP; Gao, L; Li, XY; Yan, XG				Gao Yiping; Gao Liang; Li Xinyu; Yan Xuguo			A semi-supervised convolutional neural network-based method for steel surface defect recognition	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Steel surface defect recognition; Semi-supervised learning; Convolutional Neural Network; Pseudo-Label	MACHINE	Automatic defect recognition is one of the research hotspots in steel production, but most of the current methods focus on supervised learning, which relies on large-scale labeled samples. In some real-world cases, it is difficult to collect and label enough samples for model training, and this might impede the application of most current works. The semi-supervised learning, using both labeled and unlabeled samples for model training, can overcome this problem well. In this paper, a semi-supervised learning method using the convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for steel surface defect recognition. The proposed method requires fewer labeled samples, and the unlabeled data can be used to help training. And, the CNN is improved by Pseudo-Label. The experimental results on a benchmark dataset of steel surface defect recognition indicate that the proposed method can achieve good performances with limited labeled data, which achieves an accuracy of 90.7% with 17.53% improvement. Furthermore, the proposed method has been applied to a real-world case from a Chinese steel company, and obtains an accuracy of 86.72% which significantly better than the original method in this workshop.

J	Rafiei, MH; Adeli, H				Rafiei, Mohammad Hossein; Adeli, Hojjat			A novel unsupervised deep learning model for global and local health condition assessment of structures	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article							DAMAGE DETECTION; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	A methodology is described for global and local health condition assessment of structural systems using ambient vibration response of the structure collected by sensors. The model incorporates synchrosqueezed wavelet transform, Fast Fourier Transform, and unsupervised deep Boltzmann machine to extract features from the frequency domain of the recorded signals. A probability density function is used to create a structural health index (SHI). This index can be used to assess both the global and local health conditions of the structure. A beauty of the proposed model is that it does not require costly experimental results to be obtained from a scaled version of the structure to simulate different damage states of the structure. Only ambient vibrations of the healthy structure are needed. In the absence of ambient vibrations, they can be simulated stochastically using structural properties and the probability theory. The effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated employing experimental data obtained on a shake table in Hong Kong.

However, most existing studies only focus on freeways rather than urban arterials. This paper proposes a real-time crash risk prediction model on arterials using a long short-term memory convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN). This model can explicitly learn from the various features, such as traffic flow characteristics, signal timing, and weather conditions. Specifically, LSTM captures the long-term dependency while CNN extracts the time-invariant features. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is used for resampling the training dataset. Five common models are developed to compare the results with the proposed model, such as the XGBoost, Bayesian Logistics Regression, LSTM, etc. Experiments suggest that the proposed model outperforms others in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) value, sensitivity, and false alarm rate. The findings of this paper indicate the promising performance of using LSTM-CNN to predict real-time crash risk on arterials.

Cross-modal GAN, which attempts to utilize the power of GAN to model the cross-modal joint distribution and to learn compatible cross-modal features, is becoming the research hotspot. However, the existing cross-modal GAN approaches typically 1) require labeled multimodal data of massive labor cost to establish cross-modal correlation; 2) utilize the vanilla GAN model that results in unstable training procedure and meaningless synthetic features; and 3) lack of extensibility for retrieving cross-modal data of new classes. In this article, we revisit the adversarial learning in existing cross-modal GAN methods and propose Joint Feature Synthesis and Embedding (JFSE), a novel method that jointly performs multimodal feature synthesis and common embedding space learning to overcome the above three shortcomings. Specifically, JFSE deploys two coupled conditional Wassertein GAN modules for the input data of two modalities, to synthesize meaningful and correlated multimodal features under the guidance of the word embeddings of class labels. Moreover, three advanced distribution alignment schemes with advanced cycle-consistency constraints are proposed to preserve the semantic compatibility and enable the knowledge transfer in the common embedding space for both the true and synthetic cross-modal features. All these add-ons in JFSE not only help to learn more effective common embedding space that effectively captures the cross-modal correlation but also facilitate to transfer knowledge to multimodal data of new classes. Extensive experiments are conducted on four widely used cross-modal datasets, and the comparisons with more than ten state-of-the-art approaches show that our JFSE method achieves remarkably accuracy improvement on both standard retrieval and the newly explored zero-shot and generalized zero-shot retrieval tasks.

The accurate identification of antioxidant proteins is on the upsurge owing to their therapeutic significance. However, observing the rapid increases of this toxic disease in the human body, several machine learning algorithms have been applied and performed inadequately to identify antioxidant proteins. Therefore, measuring the effectiveness of antioxidant proteins on the human body, a reliable intelligent model is indispensable for the researchers. In this study, primary protein sequences are formulated using evolutionary and sequence-based numerical descriptors. Whereas, evolutionary features are collected using a bigram Position-specific scoring matrix, besides, K-space amino acid pair (KSAAP) and dipeptide composition are utilized to extract sequential information. Furthermore, in order to reduce the computational time and to eradicate irreverent and noisy features, the Sequential forward selection and Support vector machine (SFS-SVM) based ensemble approach is applied to select optimal features. At last, several distinct nature classification learning methods are applied to choose a suitable operational engine for our model. After evaluating the empirical results, SVM using optimal features achieved an accuracy of 97.54%, 93.71% using the training and independent dataset, respectively. It was found that our proposed model outperformed and reported the highest performance than the existing computational models. It is expected that the developed model may be played a useful role in research academia as well as proteomics and drug development.

This report is a systematic review of AI in acute LVO stroke identification and triage, and characterizes LVO detection software. Methods A systematic review of acute stroke diagnostic-focused AI studies from January 2014 to February 2019 in PubMed, Medline, and Embase using terms: 'artificial intelligence' or 'machine learning or deep learning' and 'ischemic stroke' or 'large vessel occlusion' was performed. Results Variations of AI, including ML methods of random forest learning (RFL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to detect LVO strokes. Twenty studies were identified that use ML. Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) commonly used RFL, while LVO detection typically used CNNs. Image feature detection had greater sensitivity with CNN than with RFL, 85% versus 68%. However, AI algorithm performance metrics use different standards, precluding ideal objective comparison. Four current software platforms incorporate ML: Brainomix (greatest validation of AI for ASPECTS, uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs), General Electric, iSchemaView (largest number of perfusion study validations for thrombectomy), and V iz.ai (uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs, then automatically activates emergency stroke treatment systems). Conclusions AI may improve LVO stroke detection and rapid triage necessary for expedited treatment. Standardization of performance assessment is needed in future studies.

Firstly, the paper reviews the conventional time and spectrum signal analyses of two most effective type of signals, i.e. the vibration and the current for various IM faults. The vibration and the current signal analyses (time and spectral) is performed using the signals measured from different faulty IMs from a laboratory setup. Subsequently, the advantages and difficulties associated with these conventional procedures are discussed. Next, this paper presents and summarizes the existing research and development in the field of signal based automation of condition monitoring methodologies for the fault detection and diagnosis of various electrical and mechanical faults of IMs. Nowadays, artificial intelligent (AI) methods are being employed for the IM and other machine fault diagnosis. Advancements of the AI based fault diagnosis including the popular approaches are reviewed in details. These techniques are being integrated with traditional monitoring techniques. The AI based fault monitoring and detection techniques for IMs published up to 2000 are briefly described, however, more attention is paid to the techniques that are introduced in roughly past two decades, i.e. during 2000-2019. In overall, this paper includes review of system signals, conventional and advance signal processing techniques; however, it mainly covers, the selection of effective statistical features, AI methods, and associated training and testing strategies for fault diagnostics of IMs. Finally, dedicated discussions on the recent developments, research gaps and future scopes in the fault monitoring and diagnosis of IMs are added.

In this paper, a framework is proposed for the diagnosis of AD, which consists of MRI images preprocessing, feature extraction, principal component analysis, and the support vector machine (SVM) model. In particular, a new switching delayed particle swarm optimization (SDPSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the SVM parameters. The developed framework based on the SDPSO-SVM model is successfully applied to the classification of AD and MCI using MRI scans from ADNI dataset. Our developed algorithm can achieve excellent classification accuracies for 6 typical cases. Furthermore, experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several SVM models and also two other state-of-art methods with deep learning embedded, thereby serving as an effective AD diagnosis method.

Deep transfer learning-based screening models on chest X-ray (CXR) are effective for countering the COVID-19 outbreak. However, an efficient screening of COVID-19 is still a huge task due to the spatial complexity of CXRs. In this paper, a dense convolutional neural network (DCov-Net) based transfer learning model is proposed for the screening of COVID-19 suspected subjects using CXR images. A modified multi-crossover genetic algorithm (MMCGA) is then proposed to tune the hyper-parameters of DCov-Net. Majority of the existing COVID-19 diagnosis models are not interpretable as they do not provide any transparency to the users. Therefore, the concept of heat-maps is used to achieve explainability and interpretability. MMCGA based DCov-Net is implemented on a multiclass dataset that contains four different classes. Experimental results reveal that MMCGA based DCov-Net achieves better performance than the existing models. The proposed MMCGA based DCov-Net can be utilized for initial screening of COVID-19 suspected subjects with an accuracy of 99.34 +/- 0.51 %.

However, recent data-driven approaches for bearing RUL prediction still require prior knowledge to extract features, construct health indicate (HI) and set up threshold, which is inefficient in the big data era. In this paper, a pure data-driven method for bearing RUL prediction with little prior knowledge is proposed. This method includes three steps, i.e., features extraction, HI prediction and RUL calculation. In the first step, five band-pass energy values of frequency spectrum are extracted as features. Then, a recurrent neural network based on encoder-decoder framework with attention mechanism is proposed to predict HI values, which are designed closely related with the RUL values in this paper. Finally, the final RUL value can be obtained via linear regression. Experiments carried out on the dataset from PRONOSTIA and comparison with other novel approaches demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Due to undesirable variations in the background scene, MOS becomes very challenging for static and moving camera sequences. Several deep learning methods have been proposed for MOS with impressive performance. However, these methods show performance degradation in the presence of unseen videos; and usually, deep learning models require large amounts of data to avoid overfitting. Recently, graph learning has attracted significant attention in many computer vision applications since they provide tools to exploit the geometrical structure of data. In this work, concepts of graph signal processing are introduced for MOS. First, we propose a new algorithm that is composed of segmentation, background initialization, graph construction, unseen sampling, and a semi-supervised learning method inspired by the theory of recovery of graph signals. Second, theoretical developments are introduced, showing one bound for the sample complexity in semi-supervised learning, and two bounds for the condition number of the Sobolev norm. Our algorithm has the advantage of requiring less labeled data than deep learning methods while having competitive results on both static and moving camera videos. Our algorithm is also adapted for Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks and is evaluated on six publicly available datasets outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in challenging conditions.

The convolutional neural network (Microsoft ResNet-152 model; Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China) was fine-tuned with images from the training portion of the Asan dataset, MED-NODE dataset, and atlas site images (19,398 images in total). The trained model was validated with the testing portion of the Asan, Hallym and Edinburgh datasets. With the Asan dataset, the area under the curve for the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, intraepithelial carcinoma, and melanoma was 0.96 +/- 0.01, 0.83 +/- 0.01, 0.82 +/- 0.02, and 0.96 +/- 0.00, respectively. With the Edinburgh dataset, the area under the curve for the corresponding diseases was 0.90 +/- 0.01, 0.91 +/- 0.01, 0.83 +/- 0.01, and 0.88 +/- 0.01, respectively. With the Hallym dataset, the sensitivity for basal cell carcinoma diagnosis was 87.1% +/- 6.0%. The tested algorithm performance with 480 Asan and Edinburgh images was comparable to that of 16 dermatologists. To improve the performance of convolutional neural network, additional images with a broader range of ages and ethnicities should be collected.

These artificial intelligence systems are being developed to improve medical image reconstruction, noise reduction, quality assurance, triage, segmentation, computer-aided detection, computer-aided classification, and radiogenomics. In August 2018, a meeting was held in Bethesda, Maryland, at the National Institutes of Health to discuss the current state of the art and knowledge gaps and to develop a roadmap for future research initiatives. Key research priorities include: 1, new image reconstruction methods that efficiently produce images suitable for human interpretation from source data; 2, automated image labeling and annotation methods, including information extraction from the imaging report, electronic phenotyping, and prospective structured image reporting; 3, new machine learning methods for clinical imaging data, such as tailored, pretrained model architectures, and federated machine learning methods; 4, machine learning methods that can explain the advice they provide to human users (so-called explainable artificial intelligence); and 5, validated methods for image de-identification and data sharing to facilitate wide availability of clinical imaging data sets. This research roadmap is intended to identify and prioritize these needs for academic research laboratories, funding agencies, professional societies, and industry.

J	Borji, A				Borji, Ali			Pros and cons of GAN evaluation measures	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article						Generative adversarial nets; Generative models; Evaluation; Deep learning; Neural networks	NATURAL IMAGES; STATISTICS; PERCEPTION	Generative models, in particular generative adversarial networks (GANs), have gained significant attention in recent years. A number of GAN variants have been proposed and have been utilized in many applications. Despite large strides in terms of theoretical progress, evaluating and comparing GANs remains a daunting task. While several measures have been introduced, as of yet, there is no consensus as to which measure best captures strengths and limitations of models and should be used for fair model comparison. As in other areas of computer vision and machine learning, it is critical to settle on one or few good measures to steer the progress in this field. In this paper, I review and critically discuss more than 24 quantitative and 5 qualitative measures for evaluating generative models with a particular emphasis on GAN-derived models. I also provide a set of 7 desiderata followed by an evaluation of whether a given measure or a family of measures is compatible with them.				aliborji@gmail.com							131	251	255	9	56	ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE	SAN DIEGO	525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA	1077-3142	1090-235X		COMPUT VIS IMAGE UND	Comput.

For feature selection, filter methods play an important role, since they can be combined with any machine learning model and can heavily reduce run time of machine learning algorithms. The aim of the analyses is to review how different filter methods work, to compare their performance with respect to both run time and predictive accuracy, and to provide guidance for applications. Based on 16 high-dimensional classification data sets, 22 filter methods are analyzed with respect to run time and accuracy when combined with a classification method. It is concluded that there is no group of filter methods that always outperforms all other methods, but recommendations on filter methods that perform well on many of the data sets are made. Also, groups of filters that are similar with respect to the order in which they rank the features are found. For the analyses, the R machine learning package mlr is used. It provides a uniform programming API and therefore is a convenient tool to conduct feature selection using filter methods. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhang, SQ; Zhang, SL; Huang, TJ; Gao, W				Zhang, Shiqing; Zhang, Shiliang; Huang, Tiejun; Gao, Wen			Speech Emotion Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Discriminant Temporal Pyramid Matching	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						Speech emotion recognition; feature learning; deep convolutional neural network; discriminant temporal pyramid matching; Lp-norm pooling	FEATURES; DIMENSIONALITY	Speech emotion recognition is challenging because of the affective gap between the subjective emotions and low-level features. Integrating multilevel feature learning and model training, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) has exhibited remarkable success in bridging the semantic gap in visual tasks like image classification, object detection. This paper explores how to utilize a DCNN to bridge the affective gap in speech signals. To this end, we first extract three channels of log Mel-spectrograms (static, delta, and delta delta) similar to the red, green, blue (RGB) image representation as the DCNN input. Then, the AlexNet DCNN model pretrained on the large ImageNet dataset is employed to learn high-level feature representations on each segment divided from an utterance. The learned segment-level features are aggregated by a discriminant temporal pyramid matching (DTPM) strategy. DTPM combines temporal pyramid matching and optimal Lp-norm pooling to form a global utterance-level feature representation, followed by the linear support vector machines for emotion classification. Experimental results on four public datasets, that is, EMO-DB, RML, eNTERFACE05, and BAUM-1s, show the promising performance of our DCNN model and the DTPM strategy. Another interesting finding is that the DCNN model pretrained for image applications performs reasonably good in affective speech feature extraction. Further fine tuning on the target emotional speech datasets substantially promotes recognition performance.

However, a central assumption with SVRs is that all the required data is available at the time of construction, which means these algorithms cannot be used with data streams. Incremental SVR has been offered as a potential solution, but its accuracy suffers with noise and learning speeds are slow. To overcome these two limitations, we propose a novel incremental regression algorithm, called online robust support vector regression (ORSVR). ORSVR solves nonparallel bound functions simultaneously. Hence, the large quadratic programming problem (QPP) in classical v-SVR are decomposed into two smaller QPPs. An incremental learning algorithm then solves each QPP step-by-step. The results of a series of comparative experiments demonstrate that the ORSVR algorithm efficiently solves regression problems in data streams, with or without noise, and speeds up the learning process.

J	Ma, DF; Song, X; Li, P				Ma, Dongfang; Song, Xiang; Li, Pu			Daily Traffic Flow Forecasting Through a Contextual Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network Modeling Inter- and Intra-Day Traffic Patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Forecasting; Machine learning; Time series analysis; Data mining; Predictive models; Recurrent neural networks; Context modeling; Daily traffic flow; traffic pattern; contextual factors; deep learning; convolutional neural network; long short-term memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; SPEED PREDICTION; EVOLUTION; VOLUME	Traffic flow forecasting is an important problem for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems, which has been studied for more than two decades. In recent years, deep learning methods are emerging to serve as the benchmark tool for traffic flow forecasting due to its superior prediction performance. However, most studies are based on simple deep learning methods that can not capture inter- and intra-day traffic patterns as well as the correlation between contextual factors like the weather and the traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based method for daily traffic flow forecasting where incorporating contextual factors and traffic flow patterns can be critical. First, a particular convolutional neural network (CNN) is deployed to extract inter- and intra- day traffic flow patterns. Then extracted features are fed into long short-term memory (LSTM) units to learn the intra-day temporal evolution of traffic flow. Finally, contextual information of historical days is integrated to enhance the prediction performance. Through a real-data case study, we show that the proposed approach achieves over 90% prediction accuracy which greatly outperforms existing benchmark methods and its forecasting performance is robust under various scenarios.

These methods tend to focus on economically significant components of forests, thus leaving out many factors vital for forest biodiversity, such as the occurrence of species with low economical but high ecological values. Airborne hyperspectral imagery has shown significant potential for tree species classification, but the most common analysis methods, such as random forest and support vector machines, require manual feature engineering in order to utilize both spatial and spectral features, whereas deep learning methods are able to extract these features from the raw data. Our research focused on the classification of the major tree species Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch, together with an ecologically valuable keystone species, European aspen, which has a sparse and scattered occurrence in boreal forests. We compared the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) with the support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine and artificial neural network in individual tree species classification from hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. We collected hyperspectral and LiDAR data along with extensive ground reference data measurements of tree species from the 83 km(2) study area located in the southern boreal zone in Finland. A LiDAR-derived canopy height model was used to match ground reference data to aerial imagery. The best performing 3D-CNN, utilizing 4 m image patches, was able to achieve an F1-score of 0.91 for aspen, an overall F1-score of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 87%, while the lowest performing 3D-CNN utilizing 10 m image patches achieved an F1-score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85%. In comparison, the support-vector machine achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 82.4% and the artificial neural network achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.7%. Compared to the reference models, 3D-CNNs were more efficient in distinguishing coniferous species from each other, with a concurrent high accuracy for aspen classification. Deep neural networks, being black box models, hide the information about how they reach their decision. We used both occlusion and saliency maps to interpret our models. Finally, we used the best performing 3D-CNN to produce a wall-to-wall tree species map for the full study area that can later be used as a reference prediction in, for instance, tree species mapping from multispectral satellite images. The improved tree species classification demonstrated by our study can benefit both sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation.

J	Weng, LTR; He, Y; Peng, JH; Zheng, JC; Li, XY				Weng, Lintianran; He, Yuan; Peng, Jianhua; Zheng, Jianchao; Li, Xinyu			Deep cascading network architecture for robust automatic modulation classification	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Automatic modulation classification; Cascading network architecture; Deep learning; SNR; Wireless communication	NEURAL-NETWORK; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION	BACKGROUND: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a crucial role in cognitive radio, such as industrial automation, transmitter identification, and spectrum resource allocation. Recently, deep learning (DL) as a new machine learning (ML) methodology has achieved considerable implementation in AMC missions. However, few studies have examined the robustness of DL models under varying signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) environments. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this paper is to design a robust DL-based AMC model to adapt to noise changes. METHODS: The AMC task is divided into two sub-problems: SNR environment perception and modulation classification in sub-environments. A deep cascading network architecture (DCNA) is proposed to solve these two problems. DCNA is composed of an SNR estimator network (SEN) and a modulation recognition cluster network (MRCN). SEN is designed to identify the SNR levels of samples, and MRCN is composed of several subnetworks for further modulation recognition under diverse SNR settings. In addition, a label-smoothing method is proposed to promote the integration between SEN and MRCN. An auxiliary data-segmenting method is also presented to deal with the contrasting data requirements of DCNA. Note that DCNA does not utilize a specific network structure and can be generalized to various deep learning models with advanced improvements. RESULTS: Experimental results on dataset RML2016.10b show that our proposed DCNA can enhance the recognition performance of different network structures on AMC tasks.

It is therefore imperative to improve the prediction accuracy of solar power to prepare for the unknown conditions in the future. So far, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning have been widely-reported with competitive prediction performance because they can reveal the invariant structure and nonlinear features in solar data. However, these reports have not been fully reviewed. Accordingly, this paper provides a taxonomy research of the existing solar power forecasting models based on AI algorithms. Taxonomy is a process of systematically dividing solar energy prediction methods, optimizers and prediction frameworks into several categories based on their differences and similarities. We also present the challenges and potential future research directions in solar power forecasting based on AI algorithms. This review can help scientists and engineers to theoretically analyze the characteristics of various solar prediction models, thereby helping them to select the most suitable model in any application scenario.

Submissions were made by three free-modeling (FM) methods which combine the predictions of three neural networks. All three systems were guided by predictions of distances between pairs of residues produced by a neural network. Two systems assembled fragments produced by a generative neural network, one using scores from a network trained to regress GDT_TS. The third system shows that simple gradient descent on a properly constructed potential is able to perform on par with more expensive traditional search techniques and without requiring domain segmentation. In the CASP13 FM assessors' ranking by summed z-scores, this system scored highest with 68.3 vs 48.2 for the next closest group (an average GDT_TS of 61.4). The system produced high-accuracy structures (with GDT_TS scores of 70 or higher) for 11 out of 43 FM domains. Despite not explicitly using template information, the results in the template category were comparable to the best performing template-based methods.

J	Shahid, F; Zameer, A; Muneeb, M				Shahid, Farah; Zameer, Aneela; Muneeb, Muhammad			A novel genetic LSTM model for wind power forecast	ENERGY			English	Article						Wind power forecast; Long short-term memory; Genetic algorithm; Regression; Machine learning	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREDICTION; SPEED; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; GENERATION; REGRESSION; ENERGY	Variations of produced power in windmills may influence the appropriate integration in power-driven grids which may disrupt the balance between electricity demand and its production. Consequently, accurate prediction is extremely preferred for planning reliable and effective execution of power systems and to guarantee the continuous supply. For this purpose, a novel genetic long short term memory (GLSTM) framework comprising of long short term memory and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to predict short-term wind power. In the proposed GLSTM model, the strength of LSTM is employed due to its capability of automatically learning features from sequential data, while the global optimization strategy of GA is exploited to optimize window size and number of neurons in LSTM layers. Prediction from GLSTM has been compared with actual power, predictions of support vector regressor, and with reported techniques in terms of standard performance indices. It can be evaluated from the comparison that GLSTM and its variants provide accurate, reliable, and robust predictions of wind power of seven wind farms in Europe. In terms of percentage improvement, GLSTM, on average, improves wind power predictions from 6% to 30% as opposed to existing techniques. Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrates that GLSTM is significantly different from standard LSTM. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, intermittent electricity generation resulting from the random nature of wind speed poses challenges to the safety and stability of electric power grids when wind power is integrated into grids on large scales. Therefore, accurate forecasting of wind speed and wind power (WS/WP) has gradually taken on a key role in reducing wind power fluctuations in system dispatch planning. With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, especially deep learning, increasing numbers of deep learning-based models are being considered for WS/WP forecasting due to their superior ability to deal with complex nonlinear problems. This paper comprehensively reviews the various deep learning technologies being used in WS/WP forecasting, including the stages of data processing, feature extraction, and relationship learning. The forecasting performance of some popular models is tested and compared using two real-world wind datasets. In this review, three challenges to accurate WS/WP forecasting under complex conditions are identified, namely, data uncertainties, incomplete features, and intricate nonlinear relationships. Moreover, future research directions are summarized as a guide to improve the accuracy of WS/WP forecasts.

Among various excellent solutions, multiple kernel k-means with incomplete kernels forms a benchmark, which redefines the incomplete multi-view clustering as a joint optimization problem where the imputation and clustering are alternatively performed until convergence. However, the comparatively intensive computational and storage complexities preclude it from practical applications. To address these issues, we propose Late Fusion Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (LF-IMVC) which effectively and efficiently integrates the incomplete clustering matrices generated by incomplete views. Specifically, our algorithm jointly learns a consensus clustering matrix, imputes each incomplete base matrix, and optimizes the corresponding permutation matrices. We develop a three-step iterative algorithm to solve the resultant optimization problem with linear computational complexity and theoretically prove its convergence. Further, we conduct comprehensive experiments to study the proposed LF-IMVC in terms of clustering accuracy, running time, advantages of late fusion multi-view clustering, evolution of the learned consensus clustering matrix, parameter sensitivity and convergence. As indicated, our algorithm significantly and consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms with much less running time and memory.

J	Khodayar, M; Wang, JH				Khodayar, Mahdi; Wang, Jianhui			Spatio-Temporal Graph Deep Neural Network for Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Deep learning; wind speed forecasting; spatio-temporal features; long short-term memory; graph convolutional network; rough set theory	MACHINE	Wind speed forecasting is still a challenge due to the stochastic and highly varying characteristics of wind. In this paper, a graph deep learning model is proposed to learn the powerful spatio-temporal features from the wind speed and wind direction data in neighboring wind farms. The underlying wind farms are modeled by an undirected graph, where each node corresponds to a wind site. For each node, temporal features are extracted using a long short-term memory Network. A scalable graph convolutional deep learning architecture (GCDLA), motivated by the localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, leverages the extracted temporal features to forecast the wind-speed time series of the whole graph nodes. The proposed GCDLA captures spatial wind features as well as deep temporal features of the wind data at each wind site. To further improve the prediction accuracy and capture robust latent representations, the rough set theory is incorporated with the proposed graph deep network by introducing upper and lower bound parameter approximations in the model. Simulation results show the advantages of capturing deep spatial and temporal interval features in the proposed framework compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning models as well as shallow architectures in the recent literature.

In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica, causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis since the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID-19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as(a)COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds,(b)COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data,(c)COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and(d)knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19. We survey and compare research works in these directions that are accompanied by open source data and code. Future research directions for data-driven COVID-19 research are also debated. We hope that the article will provide the scientific community with an initiative to start open source extensible and transparent research in the collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Alkadi, O; Moustafa, N; Turnbull, B; Choo, KKR				Alkadi, Osama; Moustafa, Nour; Turnbull, Benjamin; Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond			A Deep Blockchain Framework-Enabled Collaborative Intrusion Detection for Protecting IoT and Cloud Networks	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Cloud computing; Contracts; Intrusion detection; Internet of Things; Data privacy; Cryptography; Blockchain; cloud systems; collaborative intrusion detection; deep learning; learning-based ensemble model; privacy preservation	LOCALIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; MECHANISM; SECURITY; BITCOIN	There has been significant research in incorporating both blockchain and intrusion detection to improve data privacy and detect existing and emerging cyberattacks, respectively. In these approaches, learning-based ensemble models can facilitate the identification of complex malicious events and concurrently ensure data privacy. Such models can also be used to provide additional security and privacy assurances during the live migration of virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud and to protect Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This would allow the secure transfer of VMs between data centers or cloud providers in real time. This article proposes a deep blockchain framework (DBF) designed to offer security-based distributed intrusion detection and privacy-based blockchain with smart contracts in IoT networks. The intrusion detection method is employed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning algorithm to deal with sequential network data and is assessed using the data sets of UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT. The privacy-based blockchain and smart contract methods are developed using the Ethereum library to provide privacy to the distributed intrusion detection engines. The DBF framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the experimental outcomes reveal that DBF outperforms the other competing models. The framework has the potential to be used as a decision support system that can assist users and cloud providers in securely migrating their data in a timely and reliable manner.

How to effectively detect AD or MCI (mild cognitive impairment) using reliable biomarkers and robust machine learning methods has become a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a novel AD multiclass classification framework with embedding feature selection and fusion based on multimodal neuroimaging. The framework has three novel aspects: (1) An l(2,1)-norm regularization term combined with the multiclass hinge loss is used to naturally select features across all the classes in each modality. (2) To fuse the complementary information contained in each modality, an l(p)-norm (1 < p < infinity) regularization term is introduced to combine different kernels to perform multiple kernel learning to avoid a sparse kernel coefficient distribution, thereby effectively exploiting complementary modalities. (3) A theorem that transforms the multiclass hinge loss minimization problem using the l(2,1)-norm and l(p)-norm regularizations to a previous solvable optimization problem and its proof are given. Additionally, it is theoretically proved that the optimization process converges to the global optimum. Extensive comparison experiments and analysis support the promising performance of the proposed method.

J	Mao, ZP; Jagtap, AD; Karniadakis, GE				Mao, Zhiping; Jagtap, Ameya D.; Karniadakis, George Em			Physics-informed neural networks for high-speed flows	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Euler equations; Machine learning; Neural networks; Conservation laws; Riemann problem; Hidden fluid mechanics	EULER EQUATIONS; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS	In this work we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the Euler equations that model high-speed aerodynamic flows. In particular, we solve both the forward and inverse problems in onedimensional and two-dimensional domains. For the forward problem, we utilize the Euler equations and the initial/boundary conditions to formulate the loss function, and solve the one-dimensional Euler equations with smooth solutions and with solutions that have a contact discontinuity as well as a two-dimensional oblique shock wave problem. We demonstrate that we can capture the solutions with only a few scattered points clustered randomly around the discontinuities. For the inverse problem, motivated by mimicking the Schlieren photography experimental technique used traditionally in high-speed aerodynamics, we use the data on density gradient del rho(x, t), the pressure p(x * , t) at a specified point x = x* as well as the conservation laws to infer all states of interest (density, velocity and pressure fields). We present illustrative benchmark examples for both the problem with smooth solutions and Riemann problems (Sod and Lax problems) with PINNs, demonstrating that all inferred states are in good agreement with the reference solutions. Moreover, we show that the choice of the position of the point x* plays an important role in the learning process. In particular, for the problem with smooth solutions we can randomly choose the position of the point x* from the computational domain, while for the Sod or Lax problem, we have to choose the position of the point x* from the domain between the initial discontinuous point and the shock position of the final time. We also solve the inverse problem by combining the aforementioned data and the Euler equations in characteristic form, showing that the results obtained by using the Euler equations in characteristic form are better than that obtained by using the Euler equations in conservative form. Furthermore, we consider another type of inverse problem, specifically, we employ PINNs to learn the value of the parameter gamma in the equation of state for the parameterized two-dimensional oblique wave problem by using the given data of the density, velocity and the pressure, and we identify the parameter gamma accurately. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the current form, where the conservation laws are imposed at random points, PINNs are not as accurate as traditional numerical methods for forward problems but they are superior for inverse problems that cannot even be solved with standard techniques.

In this letter, we propose a new method, called self-attention-based deep feature fusion (SAFF), to aggregate deep layer features and emphasize the weights of the complex objects of remote sensing scene images for remote sensing scene classification. First, the pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model is applied to extract the abstract multilayer feature maps from the original aerial imagery. Then, a nonparametric self-attention layer is proposed for spatial-wise and channel-wise weightings, which enhances the effects of the spatial responses of the representative objects and uses the infrequently occurring features more sufficiently. Thus, it can extract more discriminative features. Finally, the aggregated features are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The proposed method is experimented on several data sets, and the results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme for remote sensing scene classification.

With this approach, feature engineering and parameter tuning become unnecessary since the network parameters can be learned from data by training a single CNN that can handle various video scenes. Additionally, we propose a new approach to estimate background model from video sequences. For the training of the CNN, we employed randomly 5% video frames and their ground truth segmentations taken from the Change Detection challenge 2014 (CDnet 2014). We also utilized spatial-median filtering as the post-processing of the network outputs. Our method is evaluated with different data-sets, and it (so-called DeepBS) outperforms the existing algorithms with respect to the average ranking over different evaluation metrics announced in CDnet 2014. Furthermore, due to the network architecture, our CNN is capable of real time processing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At early ages, researchers aimed at developing navigational assistance systems for enhancing situational awareness of human operators as human is at the core of collision avoidance. Recently, autonomous vehicles have gained a remarkable amount of attention with a focus on solving collision problems by machines. This results in two groups of studies, both working on preventing collisions but with different focuses: one aims at conflict detection, and the other focuses on conflict resolution. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of collision prevention techniques based on the three basic processes of determining evasive solutions, namely, motion prediction, conflict detection, and conflict resolution. The strengths and weaknesses of different methods for these three fundamental processes are discussed. Limitations and new challenges are highlighted. Moreover, this review points out the differences between the research for manned and unmanned ships and how the research in the two domains can learn from each other. A potential roadmap for the transition from existing manned ships to fully unmanned ships is provided in the end.	[Huang, Yamin; Chen, Pengfei; van Gelder, P. H. A. J.

Recent advances in online solutions for quadratic programming problems (QPPs) have created opportunities to widen the scope of applications for support vector regression (SVR). In this vein, efforts to make SVR compatible with streaming data have been met with substantial success. However, streaming data with concept drift remain problematic because the trained prediction function in SVR tends to drift as the data distribution drifts. Aiming to contribute a solution to this aspect of SVR's advancement, we have developed continuous SVR (C-SVR) to solve regression problems with nonstationary streaming data, that is, data where the optimal input-output prediction function can drift over time. The basic idea of C-SVR is to continuously learn a series of input-output functions over a series of time windows to make predictions about different periods. However, strikingly, the learning process in different time windows is not independent. An additional similarity term in the QPP, which is solved incrementally, threads the various input-output functions together by conveying some learned knowledge through consecutive time windows. How much learned knowledge is transferred is determined by the extent of the concept drift. Experimental evaluations with both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that C-SVR has better performance than most existing methods for nonstationary streaming data regression.

J	Liang, WZ; Luo, SZ; Zhao, GY; Wu, H				Liang, Weizhang; Luo, Suizhi; Zhao, Guoyan; Wu, Hao			Predicting Hard Rock Pillar Stability Using GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM Algorithms	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						pillar stability; hard rock; prediction; gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost); light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)	DECISION TREES; MINE; STRENGTH; DESIGN; MODEL	Predicting pillar stability is a vital task in hard rock mines as pillar instability can cause large-scale collapse hazards. However, it is challenging because the pillar stability is affected by many factors. With the accumulation of pillar stability cases, machine learning (ML) has shown great potential to predict pillar stability. This study aims to predict hard rock pillar stability using gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithms. First, 236 cases with five indicators were collected from seven hard rock mines. Afterwards, the hyperparameters of each model were tuned using a five-fold cross validation (CV) approach. Based on the optimal hyperparameters configuration, prediction models were constructed using training set (70% of the data). Finally, the test set (30% of the data) was adopted to evaluate the performance of each model. The precision, recall, and F(1)indexes were utilized to analyze prediction results of each level, and the accuracy and their macro average values were used to assess the overall prediction performance. Based on the sensitivity analysis of indicators, the relative importance of each indicator was obtained. In addition, the safety factor approach and other ML algorithms were adopted as comparisons. The results showed that GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms achieved a better comprehensive performance, and their prediction accuracies were 0.8310, 0.8310, and 0.8169, respectively. The average pillar stress and ratio of pillar width to pillar height had the most important influences on prediction results. The proposed methodology can provide a reliable reference for pillar design and stability risk management.

Given this observation, the motivation for this paper is to improve optimization performance through adaptive knowledge transfer across related problems. The scope for spontaneous transfers under the simultaneous occurrence of multiple problems unveils the benefits of multitasking. Multitask optimization has recently demonstrated competence in solving multiple (related) optimization tasks concurrently. Notably, in the presence of underlying relationships between problems, the transfer of high-quality solutions across them has shown to facilitate superior performance characteristics. However, in the absence of any prior knowledge about the intertask synergies (as is often the case with general black-box optimization), the threat of predominantly negative transfer prevails. Susceptibility to negative intertask interactions can impede the overall convergence behavior. To allay such fears, in this paper, we propose a novel evolutionary computation framework that enables online learning and exploitation of the similarities (and discrepancies) between distinct tasks in multitask settings, for an enhanced optimization process. Our proposal is based on the principled theoretical arguments that seek to minimize the tendency of harmful interactions between tasks, based on a purely data-driven learning of relationships among them. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated experimentally on a series of synthetic benchmarks, as well as a practical study that provides insights into the behavior of the method in the face of several tasks occurring at once.

At this stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate. Early and accurate clinical assessment of disease severity in COVID-19 patients is essential for planning the allocation of scarce hospital resources. An explainable machine learning tool trained on blood sample data from 485 patients from Wuhan selected three biomarkers for predicting mortality of individual patients with high accuracy.

Towards this end, we propose a Deep Collaborative Embedding (DCE) model to uncover a unified latent space for images and tags. The proposed method incorporates the end-to-end learning and collaborative factor analysis in one unified framework for the optimal compatibility of representation learning and latent space discovery. A nonnegative and discrete refined tagging matrix is learned to guide the end-to-end learning. To collaboratively explore the rich context information of social images, the proposed method integrates the weakly-supervised image-tag correlation, image correlation and tag correlation simultaneously and seamlessly. The proposed model is also extended to embed new tags in the uncovered space. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used social image benchmarks for multiple social image understanding tasks. The encouraging performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates its superiority.

The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area of China is characterized by more prone to landslides for the rainfall and variation of reservoir level. Prediction of landslide displacement is favorable for the establishment of early geohazard warning system. Conventional machine learning methods as forecasting models often suffer gradient disappearance and explosion, or training is slow. Hence, a dynamic method for displacement prediction of the step-wise landslide is provided, which is based on gated recurrent unit (GRU) model with time series analysis. The establishment process of this method is interpreted and applied to Erdaohe landslide induced by multi-factors in TGR area: the accumulative displacements of landslide are obtained by the global positioning system; the measured accumulative displacements is decomposed into the trend and periodic displacements by moving average method; the predictive trend displacement is fitted by a cubic polynomial; and the periodic displacement is obtained by the GRU model training. And the support vector machine (SVM) model and GRU model are used as comparisons. It is verified that the proposed method can quite accurately predict the displacement of the landslide, which benefits for effective early geological hazards warning system. Moreover, the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy than the SVM model.

However, improperly controlled ventilation systems can expend unnecessary energy and increase health risks, while improved thermal and air quality can often result in higher energy consumption. One way to approach this dilemma is by understanding the effectiveness of the variables influencing indoor air quality (IAQ) related health and comfort. The objective of this paper is to highlight evidence and variables from empirical and deterministic models, which are combined in analytical models that current machine learning techniques often overlook. This paper reviews the analytical models and identifies the corresponding input variables, discussing their application in models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and reinforcement learning (RL). ANN and RL models have accurately described non-linear systems with uncertain dynamics and provided predictive and adaptive control strategies. The first part of this study focuses on the most common thermal comfort models and their variables, mainly related to steady-state and adaptive models.

Photonics for artificial intelligence and neuromorphic computing	NATURE PHOTONICS			English	Review							NEURAL-NETWORKS; LITHIUM-NIOBATE; MODULATOR; LASERS; IMPLEMENTATION; INTEGRATION; PERFORMANCE; MACHINE; MEMORY; EXCITABILITY	Research in photonic computing has flourished due to the proliferation of optoelectronic components on photonic integration platforms. Photonic integrated circuits have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks, providing a framework for a new class of information processing machines. Algorithms running on such hardware have the potential to address the growing demand for machine learning and artificial intelligence in areas such as medical diagnosis, telecommunications, and high-performance and scientific computing. In parallel, the development of neuromorphic electronics has highlighted challenges in that domain, particularly related to processor latency. Neuromorphic photonics offers sub-nanosecond latencies, providing a complementary opportunity to extend the domain of artificial intelligence. Here, we review recent advances in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, discuss current and future challenges, and outline the advances in science and technology needed to meet those challenges.

This paper develops a novel wind speed prediction model based on the WPD (Wavelet Packet Decomposition), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and CNNLSTM (Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Network). In the proposed WPD-CNNLSTM-CNN model, the WPD is employed to decompose the original wind speed time series into a number of sub-layers; the CNN with 1D convolution operator is used to forecast the obtained high-frequency sublayers; and the CNNLSTM is adopted to complete the forecasting of the low-frequency sub-layer. To verify and compare the prediction performance of the proposed model, eight models are used. According to the results of four experimental tests, it can be observed that: (1) the proposed model is robust and effective in predicting the 1D wind speed time series, besides, among the involved eight models, the proposed model can perform best in wind speed 1-step to 3-step predictions; (2) when the wind speed experiences sudden change, the proposed model can have better prediction performance than the other involved models.

Corona virus, also known as COVID-19 was first originated in Wuhan, Hubei province in China around December 2019 and spread out all over the world within few weeks. Based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins university and Canadian health authority, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada using state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models. In this novel research, we evaluated the key features to predict the trends and possible stopping time of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Canada and around the world. In this paper we presented the Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a deep learning approach to forecast the future COVID-19 cases. Based on the results of our Long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we predicted the possible ending point of this outbreak will be around June 2020. In addition to that, we compared transmission rates of Canada with Italy and USA. Here we also presented the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14th day predictions for 2 successive days. Our forecasts in this paper is based on the available data until March 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this of the few studies to use LSTM networks to forecast the infectious diseases.

This task is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal correlations (e.g., the constraints of road network and the law of dynamic change with time). Existing work tried to solve this problem by exploiting a variety of spatiotemporal models. However, we observe that more semantic pair-wise correlations among possibly distant roads are also critical for traffic flow prediction. To jointly model the spatial, temporal, semantic correlations with various global features in the road network, this paper proposes T-MGCN (Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning framework for traffic flow prediction. First, we identify several kinds of semantic correlations, and encode the non-Euclidean spatial correlations and heterogeneous semantic correlations among roads into multiple graphs. These correlations are then modeled by a multi-graph convolutional network. Second, a recurrent neural network is utilized to learn dynamic patterns of traffic flow to capture the temporal correlations. Third, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatiotemporal correlations with global features. We evaluate T-MGCN on two real-world traffic datasets and observe improvement by approximately 3% to 6% as compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

M.; Liu, Junqiang			Detecting breaking news rumors of emerging topics in social media	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Breaking news; Machine learning; Micro-blogs; Recurrent neural networks; Rumor detection; Social media		Users of social media websites tend to rapidly spread breaking news and trending stories without considering their truthfulness. This facilitates the spread of rumors through social networks. A rumor is a story or statement for which truthfulness has not been verified. Efficiently detecting and acting upon rumors throughout social networks is of high importance to minimizing their harmful effect. However, detecting them is not a trivial task. They belong to unseen topics or events that are not covered in the training dataset. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting breaking news rumors, instead of long-lasting rumors, that spread in social media. We propose a new approach that jointly learns word embeddings and trains a recurrent neural network with two different objectives to automatically identify rumors. The proposed strategy is simple but effective to mitigate the topic shift issues. Emerging rumors do not have to be false at the time of the detection. They can be deemed later to be true or false. However, most previous studies on rumor detection focus on long-standing rumors and assume that rumors are always false. In contrast, our experiment simulates a cross-topic emerging rumor detection scenario with a real-life rumor dataset. Experimental results suggest that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1.

The early single-image deraining methods employ a cost function, where various priors are developed to represent the properties of rain and background layers. Since 2017, single-image deraining methods step into a deep-learning era, and exploit various types of networks, i.e., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, etc., demonstrating impressive performance. Given the current rapid development, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of deraining methods over the last decade. We summarize the rain appearance models, and discuss two categories of deraining approaches: model-based and data-driven approaches. For the former, we organize the literature based on their basic models and priors. For the latter, we discuss the developed ideas related to architectures, constraints, loss functions, and training datasets. We present milestones of single-image deraining methods, review a broad selection of previous works in different categories, and provide insights on the historical development route from the model-based to data-driven methods. We also summarize performance comparisons quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond discussing the technicality of deraining methods, we also discuss the future possible directions.

RUL prediction is essential for the safety of those aboard, but also to reduce engine maintenance and repair costs. The algorithm combines time series analysis methods to forecast the values of the predictor variables with machine learning techniques to predict RUL from those variables. First, an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is used to estimate the values of the predictor variables in advance. Then, we use the result of the previous step as the input of a support vector regression model (SVM), where RUL is the response variable. The validity of the method was checked on an extensive public database, and the results compared with those obtained using a vector auto-regressive moving average (VARMA) model. Our algorithm showed a high prediction capability, far greater than that provided by the VARMA model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traditionally matter engineering-generally denoted as inverse design-was based massively on human intuition and high-throughput virtual screening. The last few years have seen the emergence of significant interest in computer-inspired designs based on evolutionary or deep learning methods. The major challenge here is that the standard strings molecular representation SMILES shows substantial weaknesses in that task because large fractions of strings do not correspond to valid molecules. Here, we solve this problem at a fundamental level and introduce SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings), a string-based representation of molecules which is 100% robust. Every SELFIES string corresponds to a valid molecule, and SELFIES can represent every molecule. SELFIES can be directly applied in arbitrary machine learning models without the adaptation of the models; each of the generated molecule candidates is valid. In our experiments, the model's internal memory stores two orders of magnitude more diverse molecules than a similar test with SMILES. Furthermore, as all molecules are valid, it allows for explanation and interpretation of the internal working of the generative models.

While annotating many samples from the new domain would address this issue, it is often too expensive or impractical. Domain Adaptation has therefore emerged as a solution to this problem; It leverages annotated data from a source domain, in which it is abundant, to train a classifier to operate in a target domain, in which it is either sparse or even lacking altogether. In this context, the recent trend consists of learning deep architectures whose weights are shared for both domains, which essentially amounts to learning domain invariant features. Here, we show that it is more effective to explicitly model the shift from one domain to the other. To this end, we introduce a two-stream architecture, where one operates in the source domain and the other in the target domain. In contrast to other approaches, the weights in corresponding layers are related but not shared. We demonstrate that this both yields higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods on several object recognition and detection tasks and consistently outperforms networks with shared weights in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

However, well-designed features are still open issues that impact on the performance of classifiers. In this paper, a novel supervised deep feature extraction method based on siamese convolutional neural network (S-CNN) is proposed to improve the performance of hyperspectral image classification. First, a CNN with five layers is designed to directly extract deep features from hyperspectral cube, where the CNN can be intended as a nonlinear transformation function. Then, the siamese network composed by two CNNs is trained to learn features that show a low intraclass and high interclass variability. The important characteristic of the presented approach is that the S-CNN is supervised with a margin ranking loss function, which can extract more discriminative features for classification tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method, the features extracted from three widely used hyperspectral data sets are fed into a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction method in conjunction with a linear SVM classifier can obtain better classification performance than that of the conventional methods.

Data-mining technology has been a frontier field in medical research, as it demonstrates excellent performance in evaluating patient risks and assisting clinical decision-making in building disease-prediction models. Therefore, data mining has unique advantages in clinical big-data research, especially in large-scale medical public databases. This article introduced the main medical public database and described the steps, tasks, and models of data mining in simple language. Additionally, we described data-mining methods along with their practical applications. The goal of this work was to aid clinical researchers in gaining a clear and intuitive understanding of the application of data-mining technology on clinical big-data in order to promote the production of research results that are beneficial to doctors and patients.

J	Zhu, J; Chen, N; Shen, CQ				Zhu, Jun; Chen, Nan; Shen, Changqing			A new data-driven transferable remaining useful life prediction approach for bearing under different working conditions	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Transfer learning; Hidden Markov model; Remaining useful life estimation	DEGRADATION SIGNALS; HEALTH PROGNOSTICS; DIAGNOSIS; STATE	Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation plays a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of a machine, which can further reduce the cost by unwanted downtime or failures. A variety of data-driven methods based on artificial intelligence have been proposed to predict RUL of key component such as bearing. However, many existing approaches have the following two shortcomings: 1) the fault occurrence time (FOT) is ignored or selected subjectively; 2) the training and testing data follow the same data distribution. Inappropriate FOT will either include unrelated information such as noise or reduce critical degradation information. The prognostic model trained with dataset in one working condition can not generalize well on dataset from another different working condition owing to distribution discrepancy. In this paper, to handle these two shortcomings, hidden Markov model (HMM) is first employed to automatically detect state change so that FOT can be located. Then a novel transfer learning method based on multiple layer perceptron (MLP) is presented to solve distribution discrepancy problem. Experiment study on RUL estimation of bearing is analyzed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect FOT adaptively, at the same time provide reliable transferable prognostics performance under different working conditions.

"Explanation" has a flexible philosophical concept of "satisfying the subjective curiosity for causal information", driving a wide spectrum of methods being invented and/or adapted from many aspects and communities, including machine learning, visual analytics, human-computer interaction and so on. Nevertheless, from the view-point of data and knowledge engineering (DKE), a best explaining practice that is cost-effective in terms of extra intelligence acquisition should exploit the causal information and explaining scenarios which is hidden richly in the data itself. In the past several years, there are plenty of works contributing in this line but there is a lack of a clear taxonomy and systematic review of the current effort. To this end, we propose this survey, reviewing and taxonomizing existing efforts from the view-point of DKE, summarizing their contribution, technical essence and comparative characteristics. Specifically, we categorize methods into data-driven methods where explanation comes from the taskrelated data, and knowledge-aware methods where extraneous knowledge is incorporated. Furthermore, in the light of practice, we provide survey of state-of-art evaluation metrics and deployed explanation applications in industrial practice.

The mobile cloud is the well-known existing offloading platform, which usually far-end network solution, to leverage computation of the resource-constrained mobile devices. Because of the far-end network solution, the user devices experience higher latency or network delay, which negatively affects the real-time mobile Internet of things (loT) applications. Therefore, this paper proposed near-end network solution of computation offloading in mobile edge/fog. The mobility, heterogeneity and geographical distribution mobile devices through several challenges in computation offloading in mobile edge/fog. However, for handling the computation resource demand from the massive mobile devices, a deep Q-learning based autonomic management framework is proposed. The distributed edge/fog network controller (FNC) scavenging the available edge/fog resources i.e. processing, memory, network to enable edge/fog computation service. The randomness in the availability of resources and numerous options for allocating those resources for offloading computation fits the problem appropriate for modeling through Markov decision process (MDP) and solution through reinforcement learning. The proposed model is simulated through MATLAB considering oscillated resource demands and mobility of end user devices. The proposed autonomic deep Q-learning based method significantly improves the performance of the computation offloading through minimizing the latency of service computing. The total power consumption due to different offloading decisions is also studied for comparative study purpose which shows the proposed approach as energy efficient with respect to the state-of-the-art computation offloading solutions.

Monitoring and Identifying Wind Turbine Generator Bearing Faults Using Deep Belief Network and EWMA Control Charts	FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						bearing failure; condition monitoring; deep belief network; EWMA control chart; SCADA data analysis	MACHINE; DISPLACEMENT; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS; MODEL; LOAD	Wind turbines are widely installed as the new source of cleaner energy production. Dynamic and random stress imposed on the generator bearing of a wind turbine may lead to overheating and failure. In this paper, a data-driven approach for condition monitoring of generator bearings using temporal temperature data is presented. Four algorithms, the support vector regression machine, neural network, extreme learning machine, and the deep belief network are applied to model the bearing behavior. Comparative analysis of the models has demonstrated that the deep belief network is most accurate. It has been observed that the bearing failure is preceded by a change in the prediction error of bearing temperature. An exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart is deployed to trend the error. Then a binary vector containing the abnormal errors and the normal residuals are generated for classifying failures. LS-SVM based classification models are developed to classify the fault bearings and the normal ones. The proposed approach has been validated with the data collected from 11 wind turbines.

The identification of Kcr sites in proteins is important for characterizing and regulating primary biological mechanisms. The use of computational approaches such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms have emerged in recent years as the traditional wet-lab experiments are time-consuming and costly. We propose as part of this study a deep learning model based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) termed as Sohoko-Kcr for the prediction of Kcr sites. Through the embedded encoding of the peptide sequences, we investigate the efficiency of RNN-based models such as long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) networks using cross-validation and independent tests. We also established the comparison between Sohoko-Kcr and other published tools to verify the efficiency of our model based on 3-fold, 5-fold, and 10-fold cross-validations using independent set tests. The results then show that the BiGRU model has consistently displayed outstanding performance and computational efficiency. Based on the proposed model, a webserver called Sohoko-Kcr was deployed for free use and is accessible at https://sohoko-research-9uu23.ondigitalocean.app.	[Tng, Sian Soo; Chua, Matthew Chin Heng] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Syst Sci, Singapore 119620, Singapore; [Yeh, Hui-Yuan] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities, Med Humanities Res Cluster, Singapore 639818, Singapore; [Le, Nguyen Quoc Khanh] Taipei Med Univ, Coll Med, Profess Master Program Artificial Intelligence Me, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Le, Nguyen Quoc Khanh] Taipei Med Univ, Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence Med, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Le, Nguyen Quoc Khanh] Taipei Med Univ Hosp, Translat Imaging Res Ctr, Taipei 110, Taiwan		Chua, MCH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Syst Sci, Singapore 119620, Singapore.; Le, NQK (corresponding author), Taipei Med Univ, Coll Med, Profess Master Program Artificial Intelligence Me, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Le, NQK (corresponding author), Taipei Med Univ, Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence Med, Taipei 106, Taiwan.; Le, NQK (corresponding author), Taipei Med Univ Hosp, Translat Imaging Res Ctr, Taipei 110, Taiwan.	khanhlee@tmu.edu.tw; mattchua@nus.edu.sg	Le, Nguyen Quoc Khanh/H-2057-2017	Le, Nguyen Quoc Khanh/0000-0003-4896-7926	Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST110-2221-E-038-001-MY2]	Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)	This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (grant number MOST110-2221-E-038-001-MY2).		52	21	21	20	32	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	1535-3893	1535-3907		J PROTEOME RES	J.

Recent methods attempt to capture this structure and learn action representations with convolutional neural networks. Such representations, however, are typically learned at the level of a few video frames failing to model actions at their full temporal extent. In this work we learn video representations using neural networks with long-term temporal convolutions (LTC). We demonstrate that LTC-CNN models with increased temporal extents improve the accuracy of action recognition. We also study the impact of different low-level representations, such as raw values of video pixels and optical flow vector fields and demonstrate the importance of high-quality optical flow estimation for learning accurate action models. We report state-of-the-art results on two challenging benchmarks for human action recognition UCF101 (92.7%) and HMDB51 (67.2%).

The widespread adoption of machine learning, in particular deep learning, in multiple scientific disciplines, and the advances in computing hardware and software, among other factors, continue to fuel this development. Much of the initial skepticism regarding applications of AI in pharmaceutical discovery has started to vanish, consequently benefitting medicinal chemistry. Areas covered: The current status of AI in chemoinformatics is reviewed. The topics discussed herein include quantitative structure-activity/property relationship and structure-based modeling, de novo molecular design, and chemical synthesis prediction. Advantages and limitations of current deep learning applications are highlighted, together with a perspective on next-generation AI for drug discovery. Expert opinion: Deep learning-based approaches have only begun to address some fundamental problems in drug discovery. Certain methodological advances, such as message-passing models, spatial-symmetry-preserving networks, hybrid de novo design, and other innovative machine learning paradigms, will likely become commonplace and help address some of the most challenging questions. Open data sharing and model development will play a central role in the advancement of drug discovery with AI.

We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for "lower" (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the "softer" intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.

Observed data consisted of 8001 wave height data: 5601 data were selected for each model development, while the remaining 2400 data were used for testing the soft-computing models applied here. Six statistical indices were considered here for evaluating the accuracies of the tested models: Coefficient of Determination (R2), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Scatter Index (SI), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The outcomes of this study revealed that the M5P model outperformed all the other models in terms of predictive performance for wave heights, and Taylor diagram and single-factor Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results confirmed that M5P and ANFIS-trimf models are highly more suitable for retrieving wave height estimations compared to the other soft-computing models. The findings of this study case represent a useful tool for ecohydraulic, sea, and coastal engineers in obtaining accurate wave height predictions when dealing with the design of engineering structures and water resource management in an extremely tangled fluid dynamic and climate context as Persian Gulf area.

One of the reasons for this advancement is the application of machine learning techniques for the analysis of medical images. Deep learning is successfully used as a tool for machine learning, where a neural network is capable of automatically learning features. This is in contrast to those methods where traditionally hand crafted features are used. The selection and calculation of these features is a challenging task. Among deep learning techniques, deep convolutional networks are actively used for the purpose of medical image analysis. This includes application areas such as segmentation, abnormality detection, disease classification, computer aided diagnosis and retrieval. In this study, a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in medical image analysis using deep convolutional networks is presented. The challenges and potential of these techniques are also highlighted.

Polymers, being inexpensive and possessing a broad range of tunable properties, are widespread in many technological applications. The vast chemical and morphological complexity of polymers though gives rise to challenges in the rational discovery of new materials for specific applications. The nascent field of polymer informatics seeks to provide tools and pathways for accelerated property prediction (and materials design) via surrogate machine learning models built on reliable past data. We have carefully accumulated a data set of organic polymers whose properties were obtained either computationally (bandgap, dielectric constant, refractive index, and atomization energy) or experimentally (glass transition temperature, solubility parameter, and density). A fingerprinting scheme that captures atomistic to morphological structural features was developed to numerically represent the polymers. Machine learning models were then trained by mapping the fingerprints (or features) to properties. Once developed, these models can rapidly predict properties of new polymers (within the same chemical class as the parent data set) and can also provide uncertainties underlying the predictions. Since different properties depend on different length-scale features, the prediction models were built on an optimized set of features for each individual property. Furthermore, these models are incorporated in a user-friendly online platform named Polymer Genome (www.polymergenome.org). Systematic and progressive expansion of both chemical and property spaces are planned to extend the applicability of Polymer Genome to a wide range of technological domains.

Many machine learning models have been proposed for runoff forecasting in recent years. To reconstruct the time series of runoff data into a standard machine learning dataset, a sliding window method is usually used to pre-process the data, with the size of the window as a variable parameter which is commonly referred to as the time step. Conventional machine learning methods, such as artificial neural network models (ANN), require optimization of the time step because both too small and too large time steps reduce prediction accuracy. In this work two popular variants of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks were employed to develop new data-driven flood forecasting models. GRU and LSTM models are in theory able to filter redundant information automatically, and therefore a large time step is expected to not reduce prediction accuracy. The three models (LSTM, GRU, and ANN) were applied to simulate runoff in the Yutan station control catchment, Fujian Province, Southeast China, using hourly discharge measurements of one runoff station and hourly rainfall of four rainfall stations from 2000 to 2014. Results show that the prediction accuracy of LSTM and GRU models increases with increasing time step, and eventually stabilizes. This allows selection of a relatively large time step in practical runoff prediction without first evaluating and optimizing the time step required by conventional machine learning models. We also show that LSTM and GRU models perform better than ANN models when the time step is optimized. GRU models have fewer parameters and less complicated structures compared to LSTM models, and our results show that GRU models perform equally well as LSTM models. GRU may be the preferred method in short term runoff predictions since it requires less time for model training.

To solve this problem, we created a set of techniques that utilize a semisupervised model that allows researchers to classify documents into predefined categories efficiently. We propose a dictionary making procedure to avoid inclusion of words that are likely to confuse the model and deteriorate the its classification performance classification accuracy using a new entropy-based diagnostic tool. In our experiments, we classify sentences of the United Nations General Assembly speeches into six predefined categories using the seeded Latent Dirichlet allocation and Newsmap, which were trained with a small "seed word dictionary" that we created following the procedure. The result shows that, while keyword dictionary can only classify 25% of sentences, Newsmap can classify over 60% of them accurately correctly and; its accuracy exceeds 70% when contextual information is taken into consideration by kernel smoothing of topic likelihoods. We argue that once seed word dictionaries are created by the international relations community, semisupervised models would become more useful than unsupervised models for theory-driven text analysis.

J	Rezaee, M; Mahdianpari, M; Zhang, Y; Salehi, B				Rezaee, Mohammad; Mahdianpari, Masoud; Zhang, Yun; Salehi, Bahram			Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Complex Wetland Classification Using Optical Remote Sensing Imagery	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						AlexNet; convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; random forest (RF); spatial feature; wetland mapping	RANDOM FORESTS	The synergistic use of spatial features with spectral properties of satellite images enhances thematic land cover information, which is of great significance for complex land cover mapping. Incorporating spatial features within the classification scheme have been mainly carried out by applying just low-level features, which have shown improvement in the classification result. By contrast, the application of high-level spatial features for classification of satellite imagery has been underrepresented. This study aims to address the lack of high-level features by proposing a classification framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn deep spatial features for wetland mapping using optical remote sensing data. Designing a fully trained new convolutional network is infeasible due to the limited amount of training data in most remote sensing studies. Thus, we applied fine tuning of a pre-existing CNN. Specifically, AlexNet was used for this purpose. The classification results obtained by the deep CNN were compared with those based on well-known ensemble classifiers, namely random forest (RF), to evaluate the efficiency of CNN. Experimental results demonstrated that CNN was superior to RF for complex wetland mapping even by incorporating the small number of input features (i.e., three features) for CNN compared to RF (i.e., eight features). The proposed classification scheme is the first attempt, investigating the potential of fine-tuning pre-existing CNN, for land cover mapping. It also serves as a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art machine learning tools for processing remote sensing data.

Wave physics, as found in acoustics and optics, is a natural candidate for building analog processors for time-varying signals. Here, we identify a mapping between the dynamics of wave physics and the computation in recurrent neural networks. This mapping indicates that physical wave systems can be trained to learn complex features in temporal data, using standard training techniques for neural networks. As a demonstration, we show that an inverse-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio signals as their waveforms scatter and propagate through it, achieving performance comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network. These findings pave the way for a new class of analog machine learning platforms, capable of fast and efficient processing of information in its native domain.

Most of the established methods, however, rely on local properties and are thus unable to take global changes in the electronic structure into account, which result from long-range charge transfer or different charge states. In this work we overcome this limitation by introducing a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential that combines a charge equilibration scheme employing environment-dependent atomic electronegativities with accurate atomic energies. The method, which is able to correctly describe global charge distributions in arbitrary systems, yields much improved energies and substantially extends the applicability of modern machine learning potentials. This is demonstrated for a series of systems representing typical scenarios in chemistry and materials science that are incorrectly described by current methods, while the fourth-generation neural network potential is in excellent agreement with electronic structure calculations. Machine learning potentials do not account for long-range charge transfer. Here the authors introduce a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential including non-local information of charge populations that is able to provide forces, charges and energies in excellent agreement with DFT data.

A number of computational models to predict response of anti-cancer drugs have been developed as the establishment of several pharmacogenomics screening databases. In our study, we proposed a deep cascaded forest model, Deep-Resp-Forest, to classify the anti-cancer drug response as "sensitive" or "resistant". We made three contributions in this study. Firstly, diverse molecular data could be effectively integrated to provide more information than single type of data for the classification. Combination of two types of data were tested here. Secondly, two structures based on the multi-grained scanning to transform the raw features into high-dimensional feature vectors and integrate the diverse data were proposed in our study. Thirdly, the original deep and time-consuming architecture of cascade forest was improved by a feature optimization operation, which emphasized the most discriminative features across layers. We evaluated the proposed method on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) data sets and then compared with the Support Vector Machine. The proposed Deep-Resp-Forest has demonstrated the promising use of deep learning and deep forest approach on the drug response prediction tasks.

In this paper we investigate a class of variational circuits for the purposes of supervised machine learning. We propose a circuit architecture suitable for predicting class labels of quantumly encoded data via measurements of certain observables. We observe that the required depth of a trainable classification circuit is related to the number of representative principal components of the data distribution. Quantum circuit architectures used in our design are validated by numerical simulation, which shows significant model size reduction compared to classical predictive models. Circuit-based models demonstrate good resilience to noise, which makes then robust and error tolerant.

J	Zhang, DW; Zeng, WY; Yao, JR; Han, JW				Zhang, Dingwen; Zeng, Wenyuan; Yao, Jieru; Han, Junwei			Weakly Supervised Object Detection Using Proposal- and Semantic-Level Relationships	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Cognition; Proposals; Object detection; Supervised learning; Semantics; Task analysis; Network architecture; Weakly supervised object detection; multiple-instance learning; graphical convolutional network		In recent years, weakly supervised object detection has attracted great attention in the computer vision community. Although numerous deep learning-based approaches have been proposed in the past few years, such an ill-posed problem is still challenging and the learning performance is still behind the expectation. In fact, most of the existing approaches only consider the visual appearance of each proposal region but ignore to make use of the helpful context information. To this end, this paper introduces two levels of context into the weakly supervised learning framework. The first one is the proposal-level context, i.e., the relationship of the spatially adjacent proposals. The second one is the semantic-level context, i.e., the relationship of the co-occurring object categories. Therefore, the proposed weakly supervised learning framework contains not only the cognition process on the visual appearance but also the reasoning process on the proposal- and semantic-level relationships, which leads to the novel deep multiple instance reasoning framework. Specifically, built upon a conventional CNN-based network architecture, the proposed framework is equipped with two additional graph convolutional network-based reasoning models to implement object location reasoning and multi-label reasoning within an end-to-end network training procedure. Comprehensive experiments on the widely used PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks have been implemented, which demonstrate the superior capacity of the proposed approach when compared with other state-of-the-art methods and baseline models.

However, the lack of process robustness, stability and repeatability caused by the unsolved complex relationships between material properties, product design, process parameters, process signatures, post AM processes and product quality has significantly impeded its broad acceptance in the industry. To facilitate efficient implementation of advanced data analytics in metal AM, which would support the development of intelligent process monitoring, control and optimisation, this paper proposes a novel Digital Twin (DT)-enabled collaborative data management framework for metal AM systems, where a Cloud DT communicates with distributed Edge DTs in different product lifecycle stages. A metal AM product data model that contains a comprehensive list of specific product lifecycle data is developed to support the collaborative data management. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed framework are validated through the practical implementation in a distributed metal AM system developed in the project MANUELA. A representative application scenario of cloud-based and deep learning-enabled metal AM layer defect analysis is also presented. The proposed DT-enabled collaborative data management has shown great potential in enhancing fundamental understanding of metal AM processes, developing simulation and prediction models, reducing development times and costs, and improving product quality and production efficiency.

Indeed, the well-known Self-Organizing Background Subtraction (SOBS) method and its variants based on neural networks have long been the leading methods on the large-scale CDnet 2012 dataset during a long time. Convolutional neural networks, which are used in deep learning, have been recently and excessively employed for background initialization, foreground detection, and deep learned features. The top background subtraction methods currently used in CDnet 2014 are based on deep neural networks, and have demonstrated a large performance improvement in comparison to conventional unsupervised approaches based on multi-feature or multi-cue strategies. Furthermore, since the seminal work of Braham and Van Droogenbroeck in 2016, a large number of studies on convolutional neural networks applied to background subtraction have been published, and a continual gain of performance has been achieved. In this context, we provide the first review of deep neural network concepts in background subtraction for novices and experts in order to analyze this success and to provide further directions. To do so, we first surveyed the background initialization and background subtraction methods based on deep neural networks concepts, and also deep learned features. We then discuss the adequacy of deep neural networks for the task of background subtraction. Finally, experimental results are presented for the CDnet 2014 dataset. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To ensure the high reliability of IIoT services, it is necessary to apply an efficient resource allocation method under the dynamic and complex environment. In view of the absence of energy-efficient resource management architecture for the entire network, this article proposes an intelligent-driven green resource allocation mechanism for the IIoT under 5G heterogeneous networks. First, an intelligent end-to-end self-organizing resource allocation framework for IIoT service is given. Next, an energy-efficient resource allocation model within the framework is proposed. It is then solved by an intelligent mechanism with the asynchronous advantage actor critic driven deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Through the comparison analysis of different methods and rewards under IIoT scenarios with proper parameters setting, the proposed method can achieve better performance than other traditional deep learning (DL) methods and maintain service quality above accepted levels as well.

FS can be considered as an optimization problem that requires an efficient optimization algorithm to find its optimal set of features. This paper proposes a wrapper FS method that combines a time-varying number of leaders and followers binary Salp Swarm Algorithm (called TVBSSA) with Random Weight Network (RWN). In this approach, the TVBSSA is used as a search strategy, while RWN is utilized as an induction algorithm. The objective function is formulated in a manner to aggregate three objectives: maximizing the classification accuracy, maximizing the reduction rate of the selected features, and minimizing the complexity of generated RWN models. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, 20 well-known UCI datasets and a number of existing FS methods are employed. The comparative results show the ability of the proposed approach in outperforming similar algorithms in the literature and its merits to be used in systems that require FS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the cortex, synapses are embedded within multilayered networks, making it difficult to determine the effect of an individual synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system. The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in deep artificial neural networks, but historically it has been viewed as biologically problematic. Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and the successes of artificial neural networks have reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation offers insights for understanding learning in the cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly by computing synaptic updates using feedback connections to deliver error signals. Although feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it is difficult to see how they could deliver the error signals required by strict formulations of backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent developments to argue that feedback connections may instead induce neural activities whose differences can be used to locally approximate these signals and hence drive effective learning in deep networks in the brain. The backpropagation of error (backprop) algorithm is frequently used to train deep neural networks in machine learning, but it has not been viewed as being implemented by the brain. In this Perspective, however, Lillicrap and colleagues argue that the key principles underlying backprop may indeed have a role in brain function.

Machine learning and deep learning (DL) models have been widely adopted to assist geophysical interpretations in recent years. Although acceptable results can be obtained, the uninterpretable nature of DL (which also has a nickname alchemy) does not improve the geological or geophysical understandings on the relationships between the observations and background sciences. This article proposes a noble interpretable DL model based on 3-D (spatialspectral) attention maps of seismic facies features. Besides regular data-augmentation techniques, the high-resolution spectral analysis technique is employed to generate multispectral seismic inputs. We propose a trainable soft attention mechanism-based deep dilated convolutional neural network (ADDCNN) to improve the automatic seismic facies analysis. Furthermore, the dilated convolution operation in the ADDCNN generates accurate and high-resolution results in an efficient way. With the attention mechanism, not only the facies-segmentation accuracy is improved but also the subtle relations between the geological depositions and the seismic spectral responses are revealed by the spatialspectral attention maps. Experiments are conducted, where all major metrics, such as classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and optimization performance, are improved while the model complexity is reduced.

The aim of this study is to investigate a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in Yanshan County, China. The two primary contributions of this study arc summarized as follows. First. W the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first time that the CNN framework is used for LSM.Second, different data representation algorithms arc developed to construct three novel CNN architectures. In this work, sixteen influencing factors associated with landslide occurrence were considered and historical landslide locations were randomly divided into training (70% of the total) and validation (30%) sets. Validation of these CNNs was performed using different commonly used measures in comparison to several of the most popular machine learning and deep learning methods. The experimental results demonstrated that the proportions of highly susceptible zones in all of the CNN landslide susceptibility maps are highly similar and lower than 30%, which indicates that these CNNs are more practical for landslide prevention and management than conventional methods. Furthermore, the proposed CNN framework achieved higher or comparable prediction accuracy. Specifically, the proposed CNNs were 3.94%-7.45% and 0.079-0.151 higher than those of the optimized support vector machine (SVM) in terms of overall accuracy (OA) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively.

Accurate yield prediction requires fundamental understanding of the functional relationship between yield and these interactive factors, and to reveal such relationship requires both comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms. In the 2018 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12%of the average yield and 50%of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11% of the average yield and 46% of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our computational results suggested that this model significantly outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the crop yield than genotype.

J	Mou, LC; Zhu, XX				Mou, Lichao; Zhu, Xiao Xiang			Learning to Pay Attention on Spectral Domain: A Spectral Attention Module-Based Convolutional Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Hyperspectral imaging; Logic gates; Task analysis; Convolution; Support vector machines; Attention module; convolutional neural network (CNN); gating mechanism; hyperspectral image classification	LAND-COVER; FUSION	Over the past few years, hyperspectral image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has progressed significantly. In spite of their effectiveness, given that hyperspectral images are of high dimensionality, CNNs can be hindered by their modeling of all spectral bands with the same weight, as probably not all bands are equally informative and predictive. Moreover, the usage of useless spectral bands in CNNs may even introduce noises and weaken the performance of networks. For the sake of boosting the representational capacity of CNNs for spectral-spatial hyperspectral data classification, in this work, we improve networks by discriminating the significance of different spectral bands. We design a network unit, which is termed as the spectral attention module, that makes use of a gating mechanism to adaptively recalibrate spectral bands by selectively emphasizing informative bands and suppressing less useful ones. We theoretically analyze and discuss why such a spectral attention module helps in a CNN for hyperspectral image classification. We demonstrate using extensive experiments that in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, the spectral attention module-based convolutional networks are able to offer competitive results. Furthermore, this work sheds light on how a CNN interacts with spectral bands for the purpose of classification.

We synthesize the growing literature that uses satellite imagery to understand these outcomes, with a focus on approaches that combine imagery with machine learning. We quantify the paucity of ground data on key human-related outcomes and the growing abundance and improving resolution (spatial, temporal, and spectral) of satellite imagery. We then review recent machine learning approaches to model-building in the context of scarce and noisy training data, highlighting how this noise often leads to incorrect assessment of model performance. We quantify recent model performance across multiple sustainable development domains, discuss research and policy applications, explore constraints to future progress, and highlight research directions for the field.

To do that, results of a series of laboratory investigations on concrete samples were considered and used to design several artificial intelligence (AI) models. The data samples include 8 parameters i.e., silica fume replacement ratio, fly ash replacement ratio, fine aggregate, water content, high rate water reducing agent, coarse aggregate, total cementitious material, and age of samples, were used to predict and optimize the compressive strength of concrete samples. For optimization purposes, this study used a human learning optimization (HLO) algorithm to find the optimal results as well as optimizing the kernel coefficients of the support vector regression (SVR) models. Initially, to form the core of this research, various models were constructed and proposed to design the required relationship between the data using SVR. Since different SVR kernels have their own coefficients, using optimization theory, the probability of error in the models was reduced and the models were identified and executed with the highest accuracy. Finally, the polynomial model was selected as the model with the lowest computational error and the highest accuracy for evaluating the compressive strength of the concrete samples. The accuracy of the proposed SVR model for training and testing data was obtained as the coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.9694 and R-2 = 0.9470, respectively. This function was considered as a relation, to be developed by the HLO algorithm to find optimal options under different conditions. The results for 14 samples, which are the most important examples of this research, showed that the optimal states are obtained with a high level of accuracy. This confirms the proper use/develop of the SVR-HLO algorithm in designing the predictive model as well as finding optimal conditions in the concrete technology area.

The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%. We hope this method will speed up COVID-19 detection and lead to more robust systems of radiology.

However, wind turbine availability and reliability, especially for offshore sites, still need to be improved, which strongly affect the cost of wind energy. Wind turbine operational cost is closely depending on component failure and repair rate, while fault detection and isolation will be very helpful to improve the availability and reliability factors. In this paper, an efficient machine learning method, random forests (RFs) in combination with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), is used to establish the data-driven wind turbine fault detection framework. In the proposed design, RF is used to rank the features by importance, which are either direct sensor signals or constructed variables from prior knowledge. Then, based on the top-ranking features, XGBoost trains the ensemble classifier for each specific fault. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations using the state-of-the-art wind turbine simulator FAST are conducted for three different types of wind turbines in both the below and above rated conditions. It is shown that the proposed approach is robust to various wind turbine models including offshore ones in different working conditions. Besides, the proposed ensemble classifier is able to protect against overfitting, and it achieves better wind turbine fault detection results than the support vector machine method when dealing with multidimensional data.

Some commonly observed challenges in HM (Pb) prediction using artificial intelligence (AI) models include overfitting, normalization, validation against classical AI models, and lack in learning/technology transfer. This study explores the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model as a superior SuperLearning (SL) algorithms for Pb prediction. The proposed model was examined using historical data at the Bramble and Deception Bay (BB and DB) stations, Australia. The model was trained at one of the stations and transferred to a cross-station and vice versa. XGBoost showed higher reliability with less declination in (R-2: coefficient of determination), i.e., 0.97 % over the testing phase, among others models at BB. At the cross-station (DB), the performance of the XGBoost model was decreased by 2.74 % (R-2) against random forests (RF). The mean absolute error (MAE) observed 40 % (XGBoost) and 47 % (RF) less than artificial neural network (ANN). The XGBoost model performance declined by 3.44 % (R-2) over testing (DB), which is minor among validated models. At the cross-station (BB), the XGBoost model showed the least decrement in terms of R-2, i.e., 7.99 % against the ANN (8.31 %), RF (10.26 %), and support vector machine (SVM, 36.19 %).

They play an important role in controlling gene expression. As machine learning has become more widely used in identifying enhancers, a number of bioinformatic tools have been developed. Although several models for identifying enhancers and their strengths have been proposed, their accuracy and efficiency have yet to be improved. Results: We propose a two-layer predictor called 'iEnhancer-XG.' It comprises a one-layer predictor (for identifying enhancers) and a second classifier (for their strength) and uses 'XGBoost' as a base classifier and five feature extraction methods, namely, k-Spectrum Profile, Mismatch k-tuple, Subsequence Profile, Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and Pseudo dinucleotide composition (PseDNC). Each method has an independent output. We place the feature vector matrix into the ensemble learning for fusion. This experiment involves the method of 'SHapley Additive explanations' to provide interpretability for the previous black box machine learning methods and improve their credibility. The accuracies of the ensemble learning method are 0.811 (first layer) and 0.657 (second layer). The rigorous 10-fold cross-validation confirms that the proposed method is significantly better than existing technologies.

J	Lu, CJ; Li, SH; Lu, ZJ				Lu, Chujie; Li, Sihui; Lu, Zhengjun			Building energy prediction using artificial neural networks: A literature survey	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Building energy prediction; Artificial neural networks; Deep learning; Smart buildings	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; COOLING LOAD; ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; TIME; MODEL; DEMAND; EFFICIENT; INTELLIGENCE; STRATEGIES; DESIGN	Building Energy prediction has emerged as an active research area due to its potential in improving energy efficiency in building energy management systems. Essentially, building energy prediction belongs to the time series forecasting or regression problem, and data-driven methods have drawn more attention recently due to their powerful ability to model complex relationships without expert knowl-edge. Among those methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proven to be one of the most suitable and potential approaches with the rapid development of deep learning. This survey focuses on the studies using ANNs for building energy prediction and provides a bibliometric analysis by selecting 324 related publications in the recent five years. This survey is the first review article to summarize the details and applications of twelve ANN architectures in building energy prediction. Moreover, we discuss three open issues and main challenges in building energy prediction using ANNs regarding choosing ANN architec-ture, improving prediction performance, and dealing with the lack of building energy data. This survey aims at giving researchers a comprehensive introduction to ANNs for building energy prediction and investigating the future research directions when they attempt to implement ANNs to predict building energy demand or consumption.

Here the authors use machine learning to engineer WelO5* halogenase variants, which led to regioselective chlorination of inert C-H bonds on a representative polyketide that is a non-natural substrate for the enzyme. Late-stage functionalization of natural products offers an elegant route to create novel entities in a relevant biological target space. In this context, enzymes capable of halogenating sp(3) carbons with high stereo- and regiocontrol under benign conditions have attracted particular attention. Enabled by a combination of smart library design and machine learning, we engineer the iron/alpha-ketoglutarate dependent halogenase WelO5* for the late-stage functionalization of the complex and chemically difficult to derivatize macrolides soraphen A and C, potent anti-fungal agents. While the wild type enzyme WelO5* does not accept the macrolide substrates, our engineering strategy leads to active halogenase variants and improves upon their apparent k(cat) and total turnover number by more than 90-fold and 300-fold, respectively. Notably, our machine-learning guided engineering approach is capable of predicting more active variants and allows us to switch the regio-selectivity of the halogenases facilitating the targeted analysis of the derivatized macrolides' structure-function activity in biological assays.

Machine learning, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), has become the most dazzling domain witnessing successful applications in a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. The incomparable accuracy of DNNs is achieved by paying the cost of hungry memory consumption and high computational complexity, which greatly impedes their deployment in embedded systems. Therefore, the DNN compression concept was naturally proposed and widely used for memory saving and compute acceleration. In the past few years, a tremendous number of compression techniques have sprung up to pursue a satisfactory tradeoff between processing efficiency and application accuracy. Recently, this wave has spread to the design of neural network accelerators for gaining extremely high performance. However, the amount of related works is incredibly huge and the reported approaches are quite divergent. This research chaos motivates us to provide a comprehensive survey on the recent advances toward the goal of efficient compression and execution of DNNs without significantly compromising accuracy, involving both the high-level algorithms and their applications in hardware design. In this article, we review the mainstream compression approaches such as compact model, tensor decomposition, data quantization, and network sparsification. We explain their compression principles, evaluation metrics, sensitivity analysis, and joint-way use. Then, we answer the question of how to leverage these methods in the design of neural network accelerators and present the state-of-the-art hardware architectures. In the end, we discuss several existing issues such as fair comparison, testing workloads, automatic compression, influence on security, and framework/hardware-level support, and give promising topics in this field and the possible challenges as well. This article attempts to enable readers to quickly build up a big picture of neural network compression and acceleration, clearly evaluate various methods, and confidently get started in the right way.

Applications which require low latency response such as video surveillance, augmented reality and autonomous vehicles demand a swift and efficient analysis of this data. Existing approaches employ cloud infrastructure to store and perform machine learning-based analytics on this data. This centralized approach has limited ability to support real-time analysis of large-scale streaming data due to network bandwidth and latency constraints between data source and cloud. We propose RealEdgeStream (RES) an edge enhanced stream analytics system for large-scale, high performance data analytics. The proposed approach investigates the problem of video stream analytics by proposing (i) filtration and (ii) identification phases. The filtration phase reduces the amount of data by filtering low-value stream objects using configurable rules. The identification phase uses deep learning inference to perform analytics on the streams of interest. The phases consist of stages which are mapped onto available in-transit and cloud resources using a placement algorithm to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints identified by a user. We demonstrate that for a 10K element data streams, with a frame rate of 15-100 per second, the job completion in the proposed system takes 49 percent less time and saves 99 percent bandwidth compared to a centralized cloud-only based approach.

In this article, a novel hierarchical feature enhancement network (HFEN) is proposed by combining signal processing and representation learning. The signal processing block extracts features with definite physical significance. Then, the representability of the physical features is improved by connecting stacked denoising autoencoders and squeeze-and-excitation networks. A novel two-stream architecture is designed for HFEN to fuse two types of features. Consequently, HFEN can extract features that can be analyzed for physical significance and that are also representative in terms of recognizable patterns. The experimental results prove that the performance of HFEN is satisfactory in terms of accuracy and efficiency when compared to other methods. Finally, this article also aims to demonstrate the potential of a new pairing that fuses the model- and data-driven strategies for IIoT.

We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset. We collected dermatoscopic images from different populations acquired and stored by different modalities. Given this diversity we had to apply different acquisition and cleaning methods and developed semi-automatic workflows utilizing specifically trained neural networks. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts. Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions.

To provide quasi real-time simultaneous detection of multiple types of damages, a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN)-based structural visual inspection method is proposed. To realize this, a database including 2,366 images (with 500 x 375 pixels) labeled for five types of damagesconcrete crack, steel corrosion with two levels (medium and high), bolt corrosion, and steel delaminationis developed. Then, the architecture of the Faster R-CNN is modified, trained, validated, and tested using this database. Results show 90.6%, 83.4%, 82.1%, 98.1%, and 84.7% average precision (AP) ratings for the five damage types, respectively, with a mean AP of 87.8%. The robustness of the trained Faster R-CNN is evaluated and demonstrated using 11 new 6,000 x 4,000-pixel images taken of different structures. Its performance is also compared to that of the traditional CNN-based method. Considering that the proposed method provides a remarkably fast test speed (0.03 seconds per image with 500 x 375 resolution), a framework for quasi real-time damage detection on video using the trained networks is developed.

Perhaps unintended, such narration extends to the reality of current drug development. A clear sex-gap exists in pharmaceutical research spanning from preclinical studies, clinical trials to post-marketing surveillance with a bias towards males. Consequently, women experience adverse drug reactions from approved drug products more often than men. Distinct differences in pharmaceutical response across drug classes and the lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology also exists between the sexes, often leading to suboptimal drug therapy in women. This review explores the influence of sex as a biological variable in drug delivery, pharmacokinetic response and overall efficacy in the context of pharmaceutical research and practice in the clinic. Prospective recommendations are provided to guide researchers towards the consideration of sex differences in methodologies and analyses. The promotion of disaggregating data according to sex to strengthen scientific rigour, encouraging innovation through the personalisation of medicines and adopting machine learning algorithms is vital for optimised drug development in the sexes and population health equity.

J	Moustafa, N; Turnbull, B; Choo, KKR				Moustafa, Nour; Turnbull, Benjamin; Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond			An Ensemble Intrusion Detection Technique Based on Proposed Statistical Flow Features for Protecting Network Traffic of Internet of Things	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Botnet; ensemble learning; Internet of Things (IoT); network intrusion detection system (NIDS); statistical flow features	CLASSIFICATION	Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly significant role in our daily activities, connecting physical objects around us into digital services. In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against loT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques.

With the increasing popularity of deep learning, most recent developments of CD methods have introduced the use of deep learning techniques to increase the accuracy and automation level over traditional methods. However, when using supervised CD methods, a large amount of labeled data is needed to train deep convolutional networks with millions of parameters. These labeled data are difficult to acquire for CD tasks. To address this limitation, a novel semisupervised convolutional network for CD (SemiCDNet) is proposed based on a generative adversarial network (GAN). First, both the labeled data and unlabeled data are input into the segmentation network to produce initial predictions and entropy maps. Then, to exploit the potential of unlabeled data, two discriminators are adopted to enforce the feature distribution consistency of segmentation maps and entropy maps between the labeled and unlabeled data. During the competitive training, the generator is continuously regularized by utilizing the unlabeled information, thus improving its generalization capability. The effectiveness and reliability of our proposed method are verified on two high-resolution remote sensing data sets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art approaches.

J	Komiske, PT; Metodiev, EM; Thaler, J				Komiske, Patrick T.; Metodiev, Eric M.; Thaler, Jesse			Energy flow networks: deep sets for particle jets	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Jets; QCD Phenomenology		A key question for machine learning approaches in particle physics is how to best represent and learn from collider events. As an event is intrinsically a variable-length unordered set of particles, we build upon recent machine learning efforts to learn directly from sets of features or point clouds. Adapting and specializing the Deep Sets framework to particle physics, we introduce Energy Flow Networks, which respect infrared and collinear safety by construction. We also develop Particle Flow Networks, which allow for general energy dependence and the inclusion of additional particle-level information such as charge and flavor. These networks feature a per-particle internal (latent) representation, and summing over all particles yields an overall event-level latent representation. We show how this latent space decomposition unifies existing event representations based on detector images and radiation moments. To demonstrate the power and simplicity of this set-based approach, we apply these networks to the collider task of discriminating quark jets from gluon jets, finding similar or improved performance compared to existing methods. We also show how the learned event representation can be directly visualized, providing insight into the inner workings of the model. These architectures lend themselves to efficiently processing and analyzing events for a wide variety of tasks at the Large Hadron Collider. Implementations and examples of our architectures are available online in our EnergyFlow package.

J	Landers, RN; Behrend, TS				Landers, Richard N.; Behrend, Tara S.			Auditing the AI Auditors: A Framework for Evaluating Fairness and Bias in High Stakes AI Predictive Models	AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST			English	Article; Early Access						audit; bias; psychology; machine learning; artificial intelligence	RISK-ASSESSMENT; SELECTION; DECISIONS; JUDGMENTS; VALIDITY; JUSTICE; IMPACT	Researchers, governments, ethics watchdogs, and the public are increasingly voicing concerns about unfairness and bias in artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision tools. Psychology's more-than-a-century of research on the measurement of psychological traits and the prediction of human behavior can benefit such conversations, yet psychological researchers often find themselves excluded due to mismatches in terminology, values, and goals across disciplines. In the present paper, we begin to build a shared interdisciplinary understanding of AI fairness and bias by first presenting three major lenses, which vary in focus and prototypicality by discipline, from which to consider relevant issues: (a) individual attitudes, (b) legality, ethicality, and morality, and (c) embedded meanings within technical domains. Using these lenses, we next present psychological audits as a standardized approach for evaluating the fairness and bias of AI systems that make predictions about humans across disciplinary perspectives. We present 12 crucial components to audits across three categories: (a) components related to AI models in terms of their source data, design, development, features, processes, and outputs, (b) components related to how information about models and their applications are presented, discussed, and understood from the perspectives of those employing the algorithm, those affected by decisions made using its predictions, and third-party observers, and (c) meta-components that must be considered across all other auditing components, including cultural context, respect for persons, and the integrity of individual research designs used to support all model developer claims. Public Significance Statement Although artificial intelligence (AI) is now being used to make decisions about people's employment, education, healthcare, and experiences with law enforcement, external evaluators do not often agree on what is necessary to show that an AI is "unbiased" or "fair." This is in part because "bias" and "fairness" mean different things to different people. We created a framework for auditing that respects these differences in pursuit of better, fairer AI.

Moreover, the proliferation and adoption of social media applications have provided extensive opportunities and challenges for researchers and practitioners. The massive amount of data generated by users using social media platforms is the result of the integration of their background details and daily activities. This enormous volume of generated data known as "big data" has been intensively researched recently. A review of the recent works is presented to obtain a broad perspective of the social media big data analytics research topic. We classify the literature based on important aspects. This study also compares possible big data analytics techniques and their quality attributes. Moreover, we provide a discussion on the applications of social media big data analytics by highlighting the state-of-the-art techniques, methods, and the quality attributes of various studies. Open research challenges in big data analytics are described as well.

The combination of experimental and computational approaches can provide insights into the inner laws between the catalytic performance and the structural and electronic properties of catalysts. Owing to the inherent advantages of 2D materials over their 3D counterparts, including high specific surface area and abundant surface defects that could provide sufficient active sites, 2D materials are promising candidates and have attracted wide interest in catalysis. Importantly, 2D materials are the most widely computationally investigated models with which to relate computational prediction with experimental confirmation conveniently. Recently, more 2D catalysts have been prepared in experiments while more accurate computational methods have been used to disclose catalytic performance, and explore the mechanism at an atomic level. In this review, recent advances are summarized related to the development and design of 2D electro/photocatalysts. The main emphasis is put on the unique properties of 2D catalysts investigated by the combination of experiments and computations. Computational methods closer to experimental environments are introduced with particular attention to bridge the gap between experiments and computations. In addition, the challenges of computations and experiments are also discussed for 2D catalysts.

Thus, the essence of domain adaptation is to mitigate the distribution divergence between the two domains. The state-of-the-art methods practice this very idea by either conducting adversarial training or minimizing a metric which defines the distribution gaps. In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation method named adversarial tight match (ATM) which enjoys the benefits of both adversarial training and metric learning. Specifically, at first, we propose a novel distance loss, named maximum density divergence (MDD), to quantify the distribution divergence. MDD minimizes the inter-domain divergence ("match" in ATM) and maximizes the intra-class density ("tight" in ATM). Then, to address the equilibrium challenge issue in adversarial domain adaptation, we consider leveraging the proposed MDD into adversarial domain adaptation framework. At last, we tailor the proposed MDD as a practical learning loss and report our ATM. Both empirical evaluation and theoretical analysis are reported to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results on four benchmarks, both classical and large-scale, show that our method is able to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on most evaluations.

The 2018 Contest addressed the problem of urban observation and monitoring with advanced multi-source optical remote sensing (multispectral LiDAR, hyperspectral imaging, and very high-resolution imagery). The competition was based on urban land use and land cover classification, aiming to distinguish between very diverse and detailed classes of urban objects, materials, and vegetation. Besides data fusion, it also quantified the respective assets of the novel sensors used to collect the data. Participants proposed elaborate approaches rooted in remote-sensing, and also in machine learning and computer vision, to make the most of the available data. Winning approaches combine convolutional neural networks with subtle earth-observation data scientist expertise.

On the other hand, data mining applications with high dimensional datasets that require high speed and accuracy are rapidly increasing. An important issue with these applications is the curse of dimensionality, where the number of features is much higher than the number of patterns. One of the dimensionality reduction approaches is feature selection that can increase the accuracy of the data mining task and reduce its computational complexity. The feature selection method aims at selecting a subset of features with the lowest inner similarity and highest relevancy to the target class. It reduces the dimensionality of the data by eliminating irrelevant, redundant, or noisy data. In this paper, a comparative analysis of different feature selection methods is presented, and a general categorization of these methods is performed. Moreover, in this paper, state-of-the-art swarm intelligence is studied, and the recent feature selection methods based on these algorithms are reviewed. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of the different studied swarm intelligence-based feature selection methods are evaluated.

The challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence	BUSINESS HORIZONS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Artificial superintelligence; Human-machine symbiosis; Machine learning; Robotics; Work displacement	BIG DATA; INTERNET; FUTURE; SCHOOL; THINGS; HAND; GO	A decade ago, we published an article in Business Horizons about the challenges and opportunities of social media with a call to action: "Users of the world, unite!" To celebrate its anniversary, we look at artificial intelligence and the need to create the rules necessary for peaceful coexistence between humanity and AI. Hence, we now are urging: "Rulers of the world, unite!" In this article, we outline six debates surrounding AI in areas like artificial superintelligence, geographical progress, and robotics; in doing so, we shed light on what is fact and what is utopia. Then, using the PESTEL framework, we talk about the six dilemmas of AI and its potential threat and use. Finally, we provide six directions on the future of AI regarding its requirements and expectations, looking at enforcement, employment, ethics, education, entente, and evolution. Understanding AI's potential future will enable governments, corporations, and societies at large (i.e., the rulers of this world) to prepare for its challenges and opportunities. This way, we can avoid a scenario in which we return in 10 years to write the article: "Dreamers of the world, unite!" (C) 2019 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Using feature extraction and information measurement, U2Fusion automatically estimates the importance of corresponding source images and comes up with adaptive information preservation degrees. Hence, different fusion tasks are unified in the same framework. Based on the adaptive degrees, a network is trained to preserve the adaptive similarity between the fusion result and source images. Therefore, the stumbling blocks in applying deep learning for image fusion, e.g., the requirement of ground-truth and specifically designed metrics, are greatly mitigated. By avoiding the loss of previous fusion capabilities when training a single model for different tasks sequentially, we obtain a unified model that is applicable to multiple fusion tasks. Moreover, a new aligned infrared and visible image dataset, RoadScene (available at https://github.com/hanna-xu/RoadScene), is released to provide a new option for benchmark evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on three typical image fusion tasks validate the effectiveness and universality of U2Fusion. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hanna-xu/U2Fusion.

J	Zhong, KY; Wang, YF; Pei, JM; Tang, SM; Han, ZL				Zhong, Kaiyang; Wang, Yifan; Pei, Jiaming; Tang, Shimeng; Han, Zonglin			Super efficiency SBM-DEA and neural network for performance evaluation	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Data envelopment analysis; Neural network; Performance evaluation; Super-efficiency SBM	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; SLACKS-BASED MEASURE; BANKS; MODEL	The traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) method used for performance evaluation has inherent problems such as being easily affected by statistical noise in data. Furthermore, when new evaluation units are added, the performance of all the original units must be re-measured, which restricts the evaluation efficiency. In this study, machine learning algorithms were applied to make up for the shortcomings of the data envelopment analysis method. First, a superefficiency SBM model was used to construct the relative effective frontier, and then machine learning algorithms were used to construct a regression model and establish the absolute effective frontier. After 15 machine learning algorithms were compared, BPNN demonstrated the best performance, and a SuperSBM-DEA-BPNN model was eventually established. The new model has the following advantages: First, compared with the traditional data envelopment analysis method, the absolute effective frontier displays better evaluation; second, compared with the data envelopment analysis and neural network fusion outlined in the previous literature, the new model can better overcome the problems associated with data envelopment analysis, thereby improving the fusion efficiency. Taking the innovation efficiency evaluation of China's regional rural commercial banks for instance, the new model is proven to be more applicable and offers more effective management tools to improve efficiency. On the whole, the new model not only provides a stable performance evaluation tool but also facilitates comparison, which has good application significance for organizations.

A review of semantic segmentation using deep neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIMEDIA INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Review						Image segmentation; Computer vision; Deep learning; Convolutional neural networks; Machine learning	IMAGE	During the long history of computer vision, one of the grand challenges has been semantic segmentation which is the ability to segment an unknown image into different parts and objects (e. g., beach, ocean, sun, dog, swimmer). Furthermore, segmentation is even deeper than object recognition because recognition is not necessary for segmentation. Specifically, humans can perform image segmentation without even knowing what the objects are (for example, in satellite imagery or medical X-ray scans, there may be several objects which are unknown, but they can still be segmented within the image typically for further investigation). Performing segmentation without knowing the exact identity of all objects in the scene is an important part of our visual understanding process which can give us a powerful model to understand the world and also be used to improve or augment existing computer vision techniques. Herein this work, we review the field of semantic segmentation as pertaining to deep convolutional neural networks. We provide comprehensive coverage of the top approaches and summarize the strengths, weaknesses and major challenges.

Field crop phenomics: enabling breeding for radiation use efficiency and biomass in cereal crops	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Review						big data; canopy temperature; crop breeding; crop physiology; photosynthesis; sorghum; stomatal conductance; wheat	CANOPY TEMPERATURE DEPRESSION; UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE; LEAF OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SPRING WHEAT CULTIVARS; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; WATER-STRESS; PLANT HEIGHT; PHENOTYPING PLATFORM; CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT	Plant phenotyping forms the core of crop breeding, allowing breeders to build on physiological traits and mechanistic science to inform their selection of material for crossing and genetic gain. Recent rapid progress in high-throughput techniques based on machine vision, robotics, and computing (plant phenomics) enables crop physiologists and breeders to quantitatively measure complex and previously intractable traits. By combining these techniques with affordable genomic sequencing and genotyping, machine learning, and genome selection approaches, breeders have an opportunity to make rapid genetic progress. This review focuses on how field-based plant phenomics can enable next-generation physiological breeding in cereal crops for traits related to radiation use efficiency, photosynthesis, and crop biomass. These traits have previously been regarded as difficult and laborious to measure but have recently become a focus as cereal breeders find genetic progress from 'Green Revolution' traits such as harvest index become exhausted. Application of LiDAR, thermal imaging, leaf and canopy spectral reflectance, Chl fluorescence, and machine learning are discussed using wheat and sorghum phenotyping as case studies. A vision of how crop genomics and high-throughput phenotyping could enable the next generation of crop research and breeding is presented.

J	Kim, D; Seo, D; Cho, S; Kang, P				Kim, Donghwa; Seo, Deokseong; Cho, Suhyoun; Kang, Pilsung			Multi-co-training for document classification using various document representations: TF-IDF, LDA, and Doc2Vec	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Document classification; Semi-supervised learning; TF-IDF; LDA; Doc2vec; Co-training	TEXT; FREQUENCY	The purpose of document classification is to assign the most appropriate label to a specified document. The main challenges in document classification are insufficient label information and unstructured sparse format. A semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach could be an effective solution to the former problem, whereas the consideration of multiple document representation schemes can resolve the latter problem. Co-training is a popular SSL method that attempts to exploit various perspectives in terms of feature subsets for the same example. In this paper, we propose multi-co-training (MCT) for improving the performance of document classification. In order to increase the variety of feature sets for classification, we transform a document using three document representation methods: term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) based on the bag-of-words scheme, topic distribution based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and neural-network based document embedding known as document to vector (Doc2Vec). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MCT is robust to parameter changes and outperforms benchmark methods under various conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The intrinsically high dimensionality of the space of realizable materials makes traditional approaches ineffective for large-scale explorations. Modern data science and machine learning tools developed for increasingly complicated problems are an attractive alternative. An imminent climate catastrophe calls for a clean energy transformation by overhauling current technologies within only several years of possible action available. Tackling this crisis requires the development of new materials at an unprecedented pace and scale. For example, organic photovoltaics have the potential to replace existing silicon-based materials to a large extent and open up new fields of application. In recent years, organic light-emitting diodes have emerged as state-of-the-art technology for digital screens and portable devices and are enabling new applications with flexible displays. Reticular frameworks allow the atom-precise synthesis of nanomaterials and promise to revolutionize the field by the potential to realize multifunctional nanopartides with applications from gas storage, gas separation, and electrochemical energy storage to nanomedicine. In the recent decade, significant advances in all these fields have been facilitated by the comprehensive application of simulation and machine learning for property prediction, property optimization, and chemical space exploration enabled by considerable advances in computing power and algorithmic efficiency. In this Account, we review the most recent contributions of our group in this thriving field of machine learning for material science. We start with a summary of the most important material classes our group has been involved in, focusing on small molecules as organic electronic materials and crystalline materials. Specifically, we highlight the data-driven approaches we employed to speed up discovery and derive material design strategies. Subsequently, our focus lies on the data-driven methodologies our group has developed and employed, elaborating on high-throughput virtual screening, inverse molecular design, Bayesian optimization, and supervised learning. We discuss the general ideas, their working principles, and their use cases with examples of successful implementations in data-driven material discovery and design efforts. Furthermore, we elaborate on potential pitfalls and remaining challenges of these methods. Finally, we provide a brief outlook for the field as we foresee increasing adaptation and implementation of large scale data-driven approaches in material discovery and design campaigns.

The development of atomic-scale representations has played, and continues to play, a central role in the success of machine-learning methods for chemistry and materials science. This review summarizes the current understanding of the nature and characteristics of the most commonly used structural and chemical descriptions of atomistic structures, highlighting the deep underlying connections between different frameworks and the ideas that lead to computationally efficient and universally applicable models. It emphasizes the link between properties, structures, their physical chemistry, and their mathematical description, provides examples of recent applications to a diverse set of chemical and materials science problems, and outlines the open questions and the most promising research directions in the field.

Prognostic Validation of a Neural Network Unified Physics Parameterization	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CONVECTIVE ADJUSTMENT SCHEME; CUMULUS PARAMETERIZATION; CLOUD ENSEMBLE; MODEL; ATMOSPHERE	Weather and climate models approximate diabatic and sub-grid-scale processes in terms of grid-scale variables using parameterizations. Current parameterizations are designed by humans based on physical understanding, observations, and process modeling. As a result, they are numerically efficient and interpretable, but potentially oversimplified. However, the advent of global high-resolution simulations and observations enables a more robust approach based on machine learning. In this letter, a neural network-based parameterization is trained using a near-global aqua-planet simulation with a 4-km resolution (NG-Aqua). The neural network predicts the apparent sources of heat and moisture averaged onto (160km)(2) grid boxes. A numerically stable scheme is obtained by minimizing the prediction error over multiple time steps rather than single one. In prognostic single-column model tests, this scheme matches both the fluctuations and equilibrium of NG-Aqua simulation better than the Community Atmosphere Model does. Plain Language Summary Computer-based atmospheric models predict future conditions based on physical laws. Unfortunately, current computers are not powerful enough to simulate these physical laws exactly and must represent the atmosphere as a 3-D digital image, with a pixel size, also known as resolution, of 100-200km. Scientists typically approximate any processes that occur below this size, such as rain clouds, using idealized physical models. Unfortunately, the ability of these models to represent the atmosphere's true complexity is limited by a scientist's imagination. The recent availability of large data sets, computational resources, and developments in computer science allows a different approach based on machine learning. In this article, we train one popular kind of machine learning model, known as neural network, to approximate the small-scale processes in climate model based on a high-resolution atmospheric simulation. To produce an accurate prediction, we had to reduce the prediction error of many days, rather than just a few hours. The resulting neural network matches the high-resolution simulation better than a state of the art traditional climate model does, a heartening result which suggests that machine learning can be blended with traditional approaches to produce better predictions of future weather and climate.

Protocol for development of a reporting guideline (TRIPOD-AI) and risk of bias tool (PROBAST-AI) for diagnostic and prognostic prediction model studies based on artificial intelligence	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						statistics & research methods; epidemiology; general medicine (see internal medicine)	INDIVIDUAL PROGNOSIS; APPLICABILITY; EXPLANATION	Introduction The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) were both published to improve the reporting and critical appraisal of prediction model studies for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Central University Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford on 10-December-2020 (R73034/RE001). Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-review publications. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019140361 and CRD42019161764.

To minimize these losses, early detection of fire and an autonomous response are important and helpful to disaster management systems. Therefore, in this article, we propose an early fire detection framework using fine-tuned convolutional neural networks for CCTV surveillance cameras, which can detect fire in varying indoor and outdoor environments. To ensure the autonomous response, we propose an adaptive prioritization mechanism for cameras in the surveillance system. Finally, we propose a dynamic channel selection algorithm for cameras based on cognitive radio networks, ensuring reliable data dissemination. Experimental results verify the higher accuracy of our fire detection scheme compared to state-of-the-art methods and validate the applicability of our framework for effective fire disaster management.

This research studies the TripAdvisor reviews of tourist attractions, including beaches, islands, temples, a pedestrian street, and markets in Phuket, Thailand. In total, 65,079 online reviews were analysed using two machine learning techniques: latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and naive Bayes modelling. LDA modelling helps the researchers determine the dimensions of each type of attraction. Four dimensions were specified for beaches and islands, three dimensions for a pedestrian street and temples, and two dimensions for markets. This research also developed two practical tools - dimensional salience-valence analysis (DSVA) and lexical salience-valence analysis (LSVA) - and used them to suggest actions for the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).

This study presents a machine learning approach based on the C5.0 decision tree (DT) model and the K-means cluster algorithm to produce a regional landslide susceptibility map. Yanchang County, a typical landslide-prone area located in northwestern China, was taken as the area of interest to introduce the proposed application procedure. A landslide inventory containing 82 landslides was prepared and subsequently randomly partitioned into two subsets: training data (70% landslide pixels) and validation data (30% landslide pixels). Fourteen landslide influencing factors were considered in the input dataset and were used to calculate the landslide occurrence probability based on the C5.0 decision tree model. Susceptibility zonation was implemented according to the cut-off values calculated by the K-means cluster algorithm. The validation results of the model performance analysis showed that the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) of the proposed model was the highest, reaching 0.88, compared with traditional models (support vector machine (SVM) = 0.85, Bayesian network (BN) = 0.81, frequency ratio (FR) = 0.75, weight of evidence (WOE) = 0.76). The landslide frequency ratio and frequency density of the high susceptibility zones were 6.76/km(2) and 0.88/km(2), respectively, which were much higher than those of the low susceptibility zones. The top 20% interval of landslide occurrence probability contained 89% of the historical landslides but only accounted for 10.3% of the total area. Our results indicate that the distribution of high susceptibility zones was more focused without containing more "stable" pixels. Therefore, the obtained susceptibility map is suitable for application to landslide risk management practices. (C) 2021 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

The discussion presented is motivated by the identified spread and little interaction between metamodeling techniques in reliability, which makes it challenging for practitioners to decide which one to consider in a context of implementation. The conceptual problem of reliability analysis and the theoretical description of the four models is presented, and complemented by a comparative discussion of applications with identification of new areas of interest. The different considerations that influence the efficiency of adaptive metamodeling are reviewed, with extension to applicability discussions for the four models researched. Despite all adaptive techniques contributing to achieve significant gains in the amount of effort required for reliability analysis, and with minimal trade-off in accuracy, they should not be expected to perform equally in regard to the dependence on the reliability problem being addressed. Cross application of methodologies, bridging the gap between methodology and application, and ensembles are some of new areas of research interest identified. One of the major critical considerations for adaptive metamodeling, and that has been target of limited research, is the need for comprehensive techniques that allow a blind selection of the most adequate model with relation to the problem in-hand. To conclude, the extensive and comprehensive discussion presented aims to be a first step for the unification of the field of adaptive metamodeling in reliability; so that future implementations do not exclusively follow individual lines of research that progressively become more narrow in scope, but also seek transversal developments in the field of adaptive metamodeling for reliability analysis.

Quantum state tomography (QST) aims to reconstruct the full quantum state from simple measurements, and therefore provides a key tool to obtain reliable analytics(1-3). However, exact brute-force approaches to QST place a high demand on computational resources, making them unfeasible for anything except small systems(4,5). Here we show how machine learning techniques can be used to perform QST of highly entangled states with more than a hundred qubits, to a high degree of accuracy. We demonstrate that machine learning allows one to reconstruct traditionally challenging many-body quantities-such as the entanglement entropyfrom simple, experimentally accessible measurements. This approach can benefit existing and future generations of devices ranging from quantum computers to ultracold-atom quantum simulators(6-8).

However, the existing studies require sophisticated data processing for feature extraction, thereby complicating the implementation in battery management systems. This paper proposes a machine-learning technique, random forest regression, for battery capacity estimation. The proposed technique is able to learn the dependency of the battery capacity on the features that are extracted from the charging voltage and capacity measurements. The random forest regression is solely based on signals, such as the measured current, voltage and time, that are available onboard during typical battery operation. The collected raw data can be directly fed into the trained model without any pre-processing, leading to a low computational cost. The incremental capacity analysis is employed for the feature selection. The developed method is applied and validated on lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide batteries with different ageing patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is able to evaluate the health states of different batteries under varied cycling conditions with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.3% and a low computational requirement. Therefore, the proposed method is promising for online battery capacity estimation.

First, 3D kernel is designed according to the structure of multi-spectral multi-temporal remote sensing data. Secondly, the 3D CNN framework with fine-tuned parameters is designed for training 3D crop samples and learning spatio-temporal discriminative representations, with the full crop growth cycles being preserved. In addition, we introduce an active learning strategy to the CNN model to improve labelling accuracy up to a required threshold with the most efficiency. Finally, experiments are carried out to test the advantage of the 3D CNN, in comparison to the two-dimensional (2D) CNN and other conventional methods. Our experiments show that the 3D CNN is especially suitable in characterizing the dynamics of crop growth and outperformed the other mainstream methods.

Unveiling the predictive power of static structure in glassy systems	NATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							DYNAMICS; LIQUIDS; RELAXATION; SIGNATURES	The physics that underlies the glass transition is both subtle and non-trivial. A machine learning approach based on graph networks is now shown to accurately predict the dynamics of glasses over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and densities. Despite decades of theoretical studies, the nature of the glass transition remains elusive and debated, while the existence of structural predictors of its dynamics is a major open question. Recent approaches propose inferring predictors from a variety of human-defined features using machine learning. Here we determine the long-time evolution of a glassy system solely from the initial particle positions and without any handcrafted features, using graph neural networks as a powerful model. We show that this method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, generalizing over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and densities. In shear experiments, it predicts the locations of rearranging particles. The structural predictors learned by our network exhibit a correlation length that increases with larger timescales to reach the size of our system. Beyond glasses, our method could apply to many other physical systems that map to a graph of local interaction.	[Bapst, V; Keck, T.; Grabska-Barwinska, A.; Donner, C.; Obika, A.; Nelson, A. W.

ADMET modeling approaches in drug discovery	DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY			English	Review							ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY; METABOLIC STABILITY; LEARNING-METHODS; RANDOM FOREST; PREDICTION; ABSORPTION; CLASSIFICATION; COMBINATORIAL; OPTIMIZATION; INTELLIGENCE	In silico prediction of ADMET is an important component of pharmaceutical R&D. Last year, the FDA approved 59 new molecular entities, with small molecules comprising 64% of the therapies approved in 2018. Estimation of pharmacokinetic properties in the early phases of drug discovery has been central to guiding hit-to-lead and lead-optimization efforts. Given the outstanding complexity of the current R&D model, drug discovery players have intensely pursued molecular modeling strategies to identify patterns in ADMET data and convert them into knowledge. The field has advanced alongside the progress of chemoinformatics, which has evolved from traditional chemometrics to advanced machine learning methods.	[Ferreira, Leonardo L.

Data-driven health diagnostics methods, particularly machine learning methods, have gained attention due to their simplicity and accuracy. However, a machine learning method is desired which can cope with the nonlinear behavior of battery cells and yet it avoids high computational complexity to work efficiently in online applications. The accuracy and robustness of machine learning methods strongly depend on the availability of a comprehensive battery degradation dataset that covers a variety of battery aging patterns. While many studies fail to address the aforementioned requirements, this study attempts to address them. Twenty-one nickel manganese cobalt oxide battery cells have been cycled in various operating conditions for more than two years to acquire the data. The partial charging voltage curve is explored to extract the health indicators that describe the health trajectory of the battery. Afterward, a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model is developed to capture the dependency between the health indicators and state of health of battery cells. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated. The results demonstrate the ability of NARX to health diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries with a maximum root mean squared error of 0.46 for untrained data. This indicates that the proposed model has high estimation accuracy, low computational complexity, and the ability of battery health estimation regardless of its aging pattern. These features point out the practicability of the proposed technique on online health diagnostics.	[Khaleghi, Sahar; Karimi, Danial; Beheshti, S.

J	Singh, D; Singh, B				Singh, Dalwinder; Singh, Birmohan			Investigating the impact of data normalization on classification performance	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Ant lion optimization; Data normalization; Feature selection; Feature weighting; k-NN classifier	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; ALGORITHM; CLASSIFIERS; INSTANCE; CRITERIA	Data normalization is one of the pre-processing approaches where the data is either scaled or transformed to make an equal contribution of each feature. The success of machine learning algorithms depends upon the quality of the data to obtain a generalized predictive model of the classification problem. The importance of data normalization for improving data quality and subsequently the performance of machine learning algorithms has been presented in many studies. But, the work lacks for the feature selection and feature weighting approaches, a current research trend in machine learning for improving performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of fourteen data normalization methods on classification performance considering full feature set, feature selection, and feature weighting. In this paper, we also present a modified Ant Lion optimization that search feature subsets and the best feature weights along with the parameter of Nearest Neighbor Classifier. Experiments are performed on 21 publicly available real and synthetic datasets, and results are analyzed based on the accuracy, the percentage of feature reduced and runtime. It has been observed from the results that no single method outperforms others. Therefore, we have suggested a set of the best and the worst methods combining the normalization procedure and empirical analysis of results. The better performers are z-Score and Pareto Scaling for the full feature set and feature selection, and tanh and its variant for feature weighting. The worst performers are Mean Centered, Variable Stability Scaling and Median and Median Absolute Deviation methods along with un-normalized data. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Detection and analysis of wheat spikes using Convolutional Neural Networks	PLANT METHODS			English	Article						Plant phenotyping; Spike detection; Deep learning; Field imaging; Statistical analysis	HIGH-THROUGHPUT; SYSTEM	BackgroundField phenotyping by remote sensing has received increased interest in recent years with the possibility of achieving high-throughput analysis of crop fields. Along with the various technological developments, the application of machine learning methods for image analysis has enhanced the potential for quantitative assessment of a multitude of crop traits. For wheat breeding purposes, assessing the production of wheat spikes, as the grain-bearing organ, is a useful proxy measure of grain production. Thus, being able to detect and characterize spikes from images of wheat fields is an essential component in a wheat breeding pipeline for the selection of high yielding varieties. ResultsWe have applied a deep learning approach to accurately detect, count and analyze wheat spikes for yield estimation. We have tested the approach on a set of images of wheat field trial comprising 10 varieties subjected to three fertilizer treatments. The images have been captured over one season, using high definition RGB cameras mounted on a land-based imaging platform, and viewing the wheat plots from an oblique angle. A subset of in-field images has been accurately labeled by manually annotating all the spike regions. This annotated dataset, called SPIKE, is then used to train four region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) which take, as input, images of wheat plots, and accurately detect and count spike regions in each plot. The CNNs also output the spike density and a classification probability for each plot. Using the same R-CNN architecture, four different models were generated based on four different datasets of training and testing images captured at various growth stages. Despite the challenging field imaging conditions, e.g., variable illumination conditions, high spike occlusion, and complex background, the four R-CNN models achieve an average detection accuracy ranging from 88 to 94% across different sets of test images. The most robust R-CNN model, which achieved the highest accuracy, is then selected to study the variation in spike production over 10 wheat varieties and three treatments. The SPIKE dataset and the trained CNN are the main contributions of this paper. ConclusionWith the availability of good training datasets such us the SPIKE dataset proposed in this article, deep learning techniques can achieve high accuracy in detecting and counting spikes from complex wheat field images. The proposed robust R-CNN model, which has been trained on spike images captured during different growth stages, is optimized for application to a wider variety of field scenarios. It accurately quantifies the differences in yield produced by the 10 varieties we have studied, and their respective responses to fertilizer treatment. We have also observed that the other R-CNN models exhibit more specialized performances. The data set and the R-CNN model, which we make publicly available, have the potential to greatly benefit plant breeders by facilitating the high throughput selection of high yielding varieties.

Intelligent Edge Computing in Internet of Vehicles: A Joint Computation Offloading and Caching Solution	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Servers; Delays; Task analysis; Artificial intelligence; Training; Optimization; Resource management; Internet of vehicles; peer offloading; content caching; Lyapunov optimization; imitation learning	VEHICULAR NETWORKS; DEEP; 5G	Recently, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become one of the most active research fields in both academic and industry, which exploits resources of vehicles and Road Side Units (RSUs) to execute various vehicular applications. Due to the increasing number of vehicles and the asymmetrical distribution of traffic flows, it is essential for the network operator to design intelligent offloading strategies to improve network performance and provide high-quality services for users. However, the lack of global information and the time-variety of IoVs make it challenging to perform effective offloading and caching decisions under long-term energy constraints of RSUs. Since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning can greatly enhance the intelligence and the performance of IoVs, we push AI inspired computing, caching and communication resources to the proximity of smart vehicles, which jointly enable RSU peer offloading, vehicle-to-RSU offloading and content caching in the IoV framework. A Mix Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to minimize total network delay, consisting of communication delay, computation delay, network congestion delay and content downloading delay of all users. Then, we develop an online multi-decision making scheme (named OMEN) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization method to solve the formulated problem, and prove that OMEN achieves near-optimal performance. Leveraging strong cognition of AI, we put forward an imitation learning enabled branch-and-bound solution in edge intelligent IoVs to speed up the problem solving process with few training samples.

The geometric relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts-e.g., the women's movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States-and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.

We propose here a fast machine-learning approach for predicting binding affinities using state-of-the-art 3D-convolutional neural networks and compare this approach to other machine-learning and scoring methods using several diverse data sets. The results for the standard PDBbind (v.2016) core test-set are state-of-the-art with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.82 and a RMSE of 1.27 in pK units between experimental and predicted affinity, but accuracy is still very sensitive to the specific protein used. K-DEEP is made available via PlayMolecule.org for users to test easily their own protein-ligand complexes, with each prediction taking a fraction of a second. We believe that the speed, performance, and ease of use of K-DEEP makes it already an attractive scoring function for modern computational chemistry pipelines.

Recently, diverse computational methods have been developed for automated identification of m(6)A sites within RNAs. To identify m(6)A sites accurately, one of the major challenges is to extract informative features to describe characteristics of m(6)A sites. However, existing feature representation methods are usually hand-crafted based, and cannot capture discriminative information of m(6)A sites. In this paper, we develop a m(6)A site predictor, named DeepM6APred. In this predictor, we propose to use a deep learning based feature descriptor with deep belief network (DBN) to extract high-level latent features. By integrating the deep features with traditional handcrafted features, we train a classification model based on support vector machine and successfully improve the predictive ability of m(6)A sites. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors, at least 2% higher in terms of Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). Moreover, a webserver that implements the DeepM6APred is established, which is cur rently available at the website: http://server.malab.cn/DeepM6APred. It is expected to be a useful tool to assist biologists to reveal the functional mechanisms of m(6)A sites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, transmitting massive amounts of heterogeneous data, perceiving complex environments from these data, and then making smart decisions in a timely manner are difficult. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, is now a proven success in various areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. AI introduced into the IoT heralds the era of AI of things (AIoT). This article presents a comprehensive survey on AIoT to show how AI can empower the IoT to make it faster, smarter, greener, and safer. Specifically, we briefly present the AIoT architecture in the context of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. Then, we present progress in AI research for IoT from four perspectives: 1) perceiving; 2) learning; 3) reasoning; and 4) behaving. Next, we summarize some promising applications of AIoT that are likely to profoundly reshape our world. Finally, we highlight the challenges facing AIoT and some potential research opportunities.

The traditional compound fault diagnosis methods focus on either bearing or gear fault diagnosis, where the compound fault is always regarded as an independent fault pattern in the process of fault diagnosis, and the relationship between the single fault and compound fault is not considered completely. To solve such a problem, a novel method called deep decoupling convolutional neural network is proposed for intelligent compound fault diagnosis. First, one-dimensional deep convolutional neural network is employed as the feature learning model, which can effectively learn the discriminative features from raw vibration signals. Second, multi-stack capsules are designed as the decoupling classifier to accurately identify and decouple the compound fault. Finally, the routing by agreement algorithm and the margin loss cost function are utilized to train and optimize the proposed model. The proposed method is validated by gearbox fault tests, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify and decouple the compound fault.

However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model f(x) = x(T)beta with a fixed coefficient vector beta) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.

However, complicated environment conditions, such as illumination variation, branch, and leaf occlusion as well as tomato overlap, have made fruit detection very challenging. In this study, an improved tomato detection model called YOLO-Tomato is proposed for dealing with these problems, based on YOLOv3. A dense architecture is incorporated into YOLOv3 to facilitate the reuse of features and help to learn a more compact and accurate model. Moreover, the model replaces the traditional rectangular bounding box (R-Bbox) with a circular bounding box (C-Bbox) for tomato localization. The new bounding boxes can then match the tomatoes more precisely, and thus improve the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) calculation for the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). They also reduce prediction coordinates. An ablation study demonstrated the efficacy of these modifications.

J	Schwalbe, N; Wahl, B				Schwalbe, Nina; Wahl, Brian			Artificial intelligence and the future of global health	LANCET			English	Review							SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; TUBERCULOSIS; INFORMATION; MORTALITY; NETWORKS	Concurrent advances in information technology infrastructure and mobile computing power in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have raised hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) might help to address challenges unique to the field of global health and accelerate achievement of the health-related sustainable development goals. A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use.

Among air pollutants, Particulate Matter (PM2.5) consists of suspended particles with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 Sources of PM2.5 can be coal-fired power generation, smoke, or dusts. These suspended particles in the air can damage the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of the human body, which may further lead to other diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, or cardiovascular diseases. To monitor and estimate the PM2.5 concentration, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are combined and applied to the PM2.5 forecasting system. To compare the overall performance of each algorithm, four measurement indexes, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) Pearson correlation coefficient and Index of Agreement (IA) are applied to the experiments in this paper. Compared with other machine learning methods, the experimental results showed that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed CNN-LSTM model (APNet) is verified to be the highest in this paper. For the CNN-LSTM model, its feasibility and practicability to forecast the PM2.5 concentration are also verified in this paper. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a deep neural network model that integrates the CNN and LSTM architectures, and through historical data such as cumulated hours of rain, cumulated wind speed and PM2.5 concentration. In the future, this study can also be applied to the prevention and control of PM2.5.

Origins of structural and electronic transitions in disordered silicon	NATURE			English	Article							AMORPHOUS-SILICON; PHASE-TRANSITION; MAXIMUM-ENTROPY; ORDER; GERMANIUM; SOLIDS; MODELS	Structurally disordered materials pose fundamental questions(1-4), including how different disordered phases ('polyamorphs') can coexist and transform from one phase to another(5-9). Amorphous silicon has been extensively studied; it forms a fourfold-coordinated, covalent network at ambient conditions and much-higher-coordinated, metallic phases under pressure(10-12). However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the structural transitions in disordered silicon has been lacking, owing to the intrinsic limitations of even the most advanced experimental and computational techniques, for example, in terms of the system sizes accessible via simulation. Here we show how atomistic machine learning models trained on accurate quantum mechanical computations can help to describe liquid-amorphous and amorphous-amorphous transitions for a system of 100,000 atoms (ten-nanometre length scale), predicting structure, stability and electronic properties. Our simulations reveal a three-step transformation sequence for amorphous silicon under increasing external pressure. First, polyamorphic low- and high-density amorphous regions are found to coexist, rather than appearing sequentially. Then, we observe a structural collapse into a distinct very-high-density amorphous (VHDA) phase. Finally, our simulations indicate the transient nature of this VHDA phase: it rapidly nucleates crystallites, ultimately leading to the formation of a polycrystalline structure, consistent with experiments(13-15) but not seen in earlier simulations(11,16-18). A machine learning model for the electronic density of states confirms the onset of metallicity during VHDA formation and the subsequent crystallization. These results shed light on the liquid and amorphous states of silicon, and, in a wider context, they exemplify a machine learning-driven approach to predictive materials modelling.

The network is trained end-to-end and comprises ten convolutional layers and five pooling layers for feature extraction, and two fully connected layers for regression, which makes it significantly deeper than related IQA models. Unique features of the proposed architecture are that: 1) with slight adaptations it can be used in a no-reference (NR) as well as in a full-reference (FR) IQA setting and 2) it allows for joint learning of local quality and local weights, i.e., relative importance of local quality to the global quality estimate, in an unified framework. Our approach is purely data-driven and does not rely on hand-crafted features or other types of prior domain knowledge about the human visual system or image statistics. We evaluate the proposed approach on the LIVE, CISQ, and TID2013 databases as well as the LIVE In the wild image quality challenge database and show superior performance to state-of-the-art NR and FR IQA methods. Finally, cross-database evaluation shows a high ability to generalize between different databases, indicating a high robustness of the learned features.

This study applies novel data-driven extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) ensemble learning methods for capturing the relationships between the USS and various basic soil parameters. Based on the soil data sets from TC304 database, a general approach is developed to predict the USS of soft clays using the two machine learning methods above, where five feature variables including the preconsolidation stress (PS), vertical effective stress (VES), liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL) and natural water content (W) are adopted. To reduce the dependence on the rule of thumb and inefficient brute-force search, the Bayesian optimization method is applied to determine the appropriate model hyper-parameters of both XGBoost and RF. The developed models are comprehensively compared with three comparison machine learning methods and two transformation models with respect to predictive accuracy and robustness under 5-fold cross-validation (CV). It is shown that XGBoost-based and RF-based methods outperform these approaches. Besides, the XGBoost-based model provides feature importance ranks, which makes it a promising tool in the prediction of geotechnical parameters and enhances the interpretability of model.

The mathematic prediction model for soil liquefaction is widely accepted, and the standard penetration (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT) prediction model using the machine learning method is also developed. But for the V-s, the prediction model based on the machine learning method is limited. So, considering the advantage of the deep learning method, a multi-layer fully connected network (ML-FCN) was proposed to optimize the deep neural network (DNN) and adopted to train the predictionmodel based on the Vs and SPT dataset in this paper. The history dataset was divided into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set by a ratio of 6:2:2 for better evaluation. The SPT dataset was extracted to train a corresponding DNN prediction model. According to the comparison results, the model trained by ML-FCN DNN could predict the liquefaction potential with higher accuracy than the model proposed by Hanna et al. (Soil Dyn Earthq Eng 27(6):521-40, 2007), which is enough to be applied to real engineering, the parameter of V-s is essential to improve the model performance as for the three sets.

However, most studies fail to assess the relative importance of each factor to COVID-19 death rate and, more importantly, how this importance varies spatially. Here, we assess the variables that are more important locally using Geographical Random Forest (GRF), a local nonlinear regression method. Through GRF, we estimated the non-linear relationships between the COVID-19 death rate and 29 socioeconomic and health-related factors during the first year of the pandemic in the USA (county level). GRF outputs are compared to global (Random Forest and OLS) and local (Geographically Weighted Regression) models. Results show that GRF outperforms all models and that the importance of variables highly varies by location. For example, lack of health insurance is the most important factor in one-third (34.86%) of the US counties. Most of these counties are (concentrated mainly in the Midwest region and South region). On the other hand, no leisure-time physical activity is the most important primary factor for 19.86% of the US counties. These counties are found in California, Oregon, Washington, and parts of the South region. Understanding the location-based characteristics and spatial patterns of socioeconomic and health factors linked to COVID-19 deaths is paramount for policy designing and decision making. In this way, interventions can be designed and implemented based on the most important factors locally, avoiding thus general guidelines addressed for the entire nation.

Evaluating the evidence for biotypes of depression: Methodological replication and extension of Drysdale et al. (2017)	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Clustering; Anxiety; Major depressive disorder; Machine learning; Replication	SYMPTOMATOLOGY IDS; MOTION CORRECTION; INVENTORY; ANXIETY; CONNECTIVITY; EFFICACY; SYSTEMS; ROBUST; MODEL	Background: Psychiatric disorders are highly heterogeneous, defined based on symptoms with little connection to potential underlying biological mechanisms. A possible approach to dissect biological heterogeneity is to look for biologically meaningful subtypes. A recent study Drysdale et al. (2017) showed promising results along this line by simultaneously using resting state fMRI and clinical data and identified four distinct subtypes of depression with different clinical profiles and abnormal resting state fMRI connectivity. These subtypes were predictive of treatment response to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. Objective: Here, we attempted to replicate the procedure followed in the Drysdale a al. study and their findings in a different clinical population and a more heterogeneous sample of 187 participants with depression and anxiety. We aimed to answer the following questions: 1) Using the same procedure, can we find a statistically significant and reliable relationship between brain connectivity and clinical symptoms? 2) Is the observed relationship similar to the one found in the original study? 3) Can we identify distinct and reliable subtypes? 4) Do they have similar clinical profiles as the subtypes identified in the original study? Methods: We followed the original procedure as closely as possible, including a canonical correlation analysis to find a low dimensional representation of clinically relevant resting state fMRI features, followed by hierarchical clustering to identify subtypes. We extended the original procedure using additional statistical tests, to test the statistical significance of the relationship between resting state fMRI and clinical data, and the existence of distinct subtypes. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the whole procedure using resampling. Results and conclusion: As in the original study, we found extremely high canonical correlations between functional connectivity and clinical symptoms, and an optimal three-cluster solution. However, neither canonical correlations nor clusters were statistically significant. On the basis of our extensive evaluations of the analysis methodology used and within the limits of comparison of our sample relative to the sample used in Drysdale et al., we argue that the evidence for the existence of the distinct resting state connectivity-based subtypes of depression should be interpreted with caution.

Consequently, a timely and cost-effective evaluation of imaging data is hardly feasible without the support of methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can facilitate and shorten various timeconsuming steps in the image processing workflow, e.g., tumor segmentation, thereby optimizing productivity. Besides, the automated and computer-based analysis of imaging data may help to increase data comparability as it is independent of the experience level of the evaluating clinician. Importantly, AI offers the potential to extract new features from the routinely acquired neuroimages of brain tumor patients. In combination with patient data such as survival, molecular markers, or genomics, mathematical models can be generated that allow, for example, the prediction of treatment response or prognosis, as well as the noninvasive assessment of molecular markers. The subdiscipline of AI dealing with the computation, identification, and extraction of image features, as well as the generation of prognostic or predictive mathematical models, is termed radiomics. This review article summarizes the basics, the current workflow, and methods used in radiomics with a focus on feature-based radiomics in neuro-oncology and provides selected examples of its clinical application.

The number of humanitarian relief actions is growing due to the increased frequency of natural and man-made crises. Various streams of research across different disciplines have focused on ICT and AI solutions for enhancing disaster management processes. However, most of the existing research is fragmented without a common vision towards a converging paradigm. Recognizing this, this paper presents the Disaster City Digital Twin as a unifying paradigm. The four main components of the proposed Digital Twin paradigm include: multi-data sensing for data collection, data integration and analytics, multi-actor game-theoretic decision making, and dynamic network analysis. For each component, the current state of the art related to AI methods and approaches are examined and gaps are identified.

Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this article, we seek to clarify the trade-offs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy. Methods: We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science, and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments. Results: We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy. Conclusions: Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging trade-offs. These lessons apply to applications well beyond criminology where assessments of risk can be used by decision makers. Examples include mortgage lending, employment, college admissions, child welfare, and medical diagnoses.

The goal of this review is to summarise current debates and identify open questions for future research. Five literature databases were searched to support the following research question: how can the primary ethical risks presented by AI-health be categorised, and what issues must policymakers, regulators and developers consider in order to be 'ethically mindful? A series of screening stages were carried out-for example, removing articles that focused on digital health in general (e.g. data sharing, data access, data privacy, surveillance/nudging, consent, ownership of health data, evidence of efficacy)-yielding a total of 156 papers that were included in the review. We find that ethical issues can be (a) epistemic, related to misguided, inconclusive or inscrutable evidence; (b) normative, related to unfair outcomes and transformative effectives; or (c) related to traceability. We further find that these ethical issues arise at six levels of abstraction: individual, interpersonal, group, institutional, and societal or sectoral. Finally, we outline a number of considerations for policymakers and regulators, mapping these to existing literature, and categorising each as epistemic, normative or traceability-related and at the relevant level of abstraction. Our goal is to inform policymakers, regulators and developers of what they must consider if they are to enable health and care systems to capitalise on the dual advantage of ethical AI; maximising the opportunities to cut costs, improve care, and improve the efficiency of health and care systems, whilst proactively avoiding the potential harms. We argue that if action is not swiftly taken in this regard, a new 'AI winter' could occur due to chilling effects related to a loss of public trust in the benefits of AI for health care.

However, end users often have to customize existing systems for their individual tasks, which can require substantial NLP skills. Here we present CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a newly developed clinical NLP toolkit that provides not only state-of-the-art NLP components, but also a user-friendly graphic user interface that can help users quickly build customized NLP pipelines for their individual applications. Our evaluation shows that the CLAMP default pipeline achieved good performance on named entity recognition and concept encoding. We also demonstrate the efficiency of the CLAMP graphic user interface in building customized, high-performance NLP pipelines with 2 use cases, extracting smoking status and lab test values. CLAMP is publicly available for research use, and we believe it is a unique asset for the clinical NLP community.

Our method achieves robust out-of-sample performance in this high-dimensional setting by imposing an economically motivated prior on SDF coefficients that shrinks contributions of low-variance principal components of the candidate characteristics-based factors. We find that characteristics-sparse SDFs formed from a few such factors-e.g., the four- or five-factor models in the recent literature cannot adequately summarize the cross-section of expected stock returns. However, an SDF formed from a small number of principal components performs well. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We used an Internet sample (N = 24,000), evenly distributed between ages of 18 and 50 years and tested with a 300-item questionnaire. Separately based on domains, facets, and items, we trained models to predict age in one part of the sample and tested their predictive accuracy in another part. Big Five domains predicted age with an accuracy of r = .28, whereas facets' (r = .44) and items' (r = .65) predictions were more accurate. Less than 15% of the sample was needed to train models to their optimal accuracy. Residualizing the 300 items for all facets had no impact on their predictive accuracy, suggesting that age differences in specific behaviors, thoughts, and feelings (i.e., items) were not because of domains and facets but mostly unique to nuances. These findings replicated in a multisample dataset tested with another questionnaire. We found little evidence that age differences only appeared nuanced because items referred to age-graded roles or experiences. Therefore, a substantial part of personality development may be uniquely ascribed to narrow personality characteristics, suggesting the possibility for a many-dimensional representation of personality development. Besides theoretical implications, we provide concrete illustrations of how this can open new research avenues by enabling to study systematic variations between traits.

A hardware-oriented lightweight authentication protocol based on device signature generated during voltage over-scaling (VOS) was recently proposed to address this issue. VOS-based authentication employs the computation unit such as adders to generate the process variation dependent error, which is combined with secret keys to create a two-factor authentication protocol. In this article, machine learning (ML)-based modeling attacks to break such authentication is presented. We also propose a challenge self-obfuscation structure (CSoS) which employs previous challenges combined with keys or random numbers to obfuscate the current challenge for the VOS-based authentication to resist ML attacks. Experimental results show that ANN, RNN, and CMA-ES can clone the challenge-response behavior of VOS-based authentication with up to 99.65 percent prediction accuracy, while the prediction accuracy is less than 51.2 percent after deploying our proposed ML resilient technique. In addition, our proposed CSoS also shows good obfuscation ability for strong PUFs. Experimental results show that the modeling accuracy is below 54 percent when 10(6) challenge-response pairs (CRPs) are collected to model the CSoS-based Arbiter PUF with ML attacks based on LR, SVM, ANN, RNN, and CMA-ES.

As insiders reside behind the enterprise-level security defence mechanisms and often have privileged access to the network, detecting and preventing insider threats is a complex and challenging problem. In fact, many schemes and systems have been proposed to address insider threats from different perspectives, such as intent, type of threat, or available audit data source. This survey attempts to line up these works together with only three most common types of insider namely traitor, masquerader, and unintentional perpetrator, while reviewing the countermeasures from a data analytics perspective. Uniquely, this survey takes into account the early stage threats which may lead to a malicious insider rising up. When direct and indirect threats are put on the same page, all the relevant works can be categorised as host, network, or contextual data-based according to audit data source and each work is reviewed for its capability against insider threats, how the information is extracted from the engaged data sources, and what the decision-making algorithm is. The works are also compared and contrasted. Finally, some issues are raised based on the observations from the reviewed works and new research gaps and challenges identified.

Through mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of signal intensities and pixel interrelationships, radiomics quantifies textural information by using analysis methods from the field of artificial intelligence. Various studies from different fields in imaging have been published so far, highlighting the potential of radiomics to enhance clinical decision-making. However, the field faces several important challenges, which are mainly caused by the various technical factors influencing the extracted radiomic features. The aim of the present review is twofold: first, we present the typical workflow of a radiomics analysis and deliver a practical "how-to" guide for a typical radiomics analysis. Second, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics, suggest potential improvements, and summarize relevant literature on the subject.

Predictive modeling approaches that define and validate models with independent datasets offer a solution to this problem. While these methods can detect novel and generalizable brain-behavior associations, they can be daunting, which has limited their use by the wider connectivity community. Here, we offer practical advice and examples based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data for implementing these approaches. We hope these ten rules will increase the use of predictive models with neuroimaging data.	[Scheinost, Dustin; Lake, Evelyn M. R.; Shen, Xilin; Constable, R.

Due to the ultralow porosity and permeability, it requires the horizontal well drilling and the multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technology to successfully produce the shale gas. The accurate prediction of shale gas production is crucial to the reasonable design of the development plan. However, due to the complex hydraulic fracture network and the gas flow mechanism, the physics-based shale gas production prediction model is still under way. The data-driven model provide an alternative way to deal with the production prediction problem. The multi-objective random forest method is proposed to predict the dynamic production data. The geological and hydraulic fracturing properties are used as input feature. Its prediction performance is evaluated based on the R squared values after determining the appropriate hyper-parameters. The ranking of variable importance can be helpful to improve the interpretability of the data-driven model. The initial peak production rate before declining can be also used as an additional input feature. With the initial peak production rate augmented into the feature set, it can greatly improve the prediction of shale gas production. The variable importance analysis results show that it can be the most influencing factor to prediction accuracy and the ranking of other factors can be altered significantly. The performance of multi-objective random forest (MORF) and multi-output regression chain (MORC) methods are compared, and the comparison result indicates MORC requires a relatively smaller random forest structure, but the prediction performance of MORF is better than MORC. More sample data with less measurement errors can increase the accuracy of the data-driven shale gas production model but there exists a threshold value to improve the accuracy of the data-driven shale gas production model but there exists a threshold value to improve the accuracy gain.

Direction-of-Arrival Estimation Based on Deep Neural Networks With Robustness to Array Imperfections	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION			English	Article						Array imperfection; deep neural network (DNN); direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation; multitask autoencoder; one-versus-all classification; supervised learning	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; CALIBRATION; COMPENSATION; PERSPECTIVE; LOCATION; MUSIC	Lacking of adaptation to various array imperfections is an open problem for most high-precision direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods. Machine learning-based methods are data-driven, they do not rely on prior assumptions about array geometries, and are expected to adapt better to array imperfections when compared with model-based counterparts. This paper introduces a framework of the deep neural network to address the DOA estimation problem, so as to obtain good adaptation to array imperfections and enhanced generalization to unseen scenarios. The framework consists of a multitask autoencoder and a series of parallel multilayer classifiers. The autoencoder acts like a group of spatial filters, it decomposes the input into multiple components in different spatial subregions. These components thus have more concentrated distributions than the original input, which helps to reduce the burden of generalization for subsequent DOA estimation classifiers. The classifiers follow a one-versus-all classification guideline to determine if there are signal components near preseted directional grids, and the classification results are concatenated to reconstruct a spatial spectrum and estimate signal directions.

A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs and kernel regression achieved similar performance across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. When predicting fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank, performance of all algorithms dramatically improved when sample size increased from 100 to 1000 subjects. Improvement was smaller, but still significant, when sample size increased from 1000 to 5000 subjects. Importantly, kernel regression was competitive across all sample sizes. Overall, our study suggests that kernel regression is as effective as DNNs for RSFC-based behavioral prediction, while incurring significantly lower computational costs. Therefore, kernel regression might serve as a useful baseline algorithm for future studies.	[He, Tong; Kong, Ru; Minh Nguyen; Yeo, B. T.

However, existing solutions merely rely on the association between the holistic language features and visual features, while neglect the nature of composite reasoning implied in the language. In this paper, we propose a natural language grounding model that can automatically compose a binary tree structure for parsing the language and then perform visual reasoning along the tree in a bottom-up fashion. We call our model RvG-Tree: Recursive Grounding Tree, which is inspired by the intuition that any language expression can be recursively decomposed into two constituent parts, and the grounding confidence score can be recursively accumulated by calculating their grounding scores returned by the two sub-trees. RvG-Tree can be trained end-to-end by using the Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax estimator that allows the gradients from the continuous score functions passing through the discrete tree construction. Experiments on several benchmarks show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance with more explainable reasoning.

Artificial intelligence in the AEC industry: Scientometric analysis and visualization of research activities	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Architecture-engineering-construction; Artificial intelligence; Machine intelligence; Industry 4.0; Automation; Digital transformation; Scientometric; Review	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS; COMPUTER VISION; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; TOOLS; CRACK; BIM	The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is fraught with complex and difficult problems. Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful tool to assist in addressing these problems. Therefore, over the years, researchers have been conducting research on AI in the AEC industry (Al-in-the-AECI). In this paper, the first comprehensive scientometric study appraising the state-of-the-art of research on Al-in-the-AECI is presented. The science mapping method was used to systematically and quantitatively analyze 41,827 related bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus. The results indicated that genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, and machine learning have been the most widely used AI methods in AEC. Optimization, simulation, uncertainty, project management, and bridges have been the most commonly addressed topics/issues using AI methods/concepts. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lies in it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of the literature on Al-in-the-AECI. This study adds value to the AEC literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns, identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on Al-in-the-AECI. The findings bring to light the deficiencies in the current research and provide paths for future research, where they indicated that future research opportunities lie in applying robotic automation and convolutional neural networks to AEC problems. For the world of practice, the study offers a readily-available point of reference for practitioners, policy makers, and research and development (R&D) bodies. This study therefore raises the level of awareness of AI and facilitates building the intellectual wealth of the AI area in the AEC industry.	[Darko, Amos; Chan, Albert P.

J	Yu, L; Xia, MF; An, Q				Yu, Liang; Xia, Mingfei; An, Qi			A network embedding framework based on integrating multiplex network for drug combination prediction	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						drug combination; network embedding; multiplex network; machine learning	HYPERTENSION; HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE; TISSUE	Drug combination is a sensible strategy for disease treatment because it improves the treatment efficacy and reduces concomitant side effects. Due to the large number of possible combinations among candidate compounds, exhaustive screening is prohibitive. Currently, a large number of studies have focused on predicting potential drug combinations. However, these methods are not entirely satisfactory in terms of performance and scalability. In this paper, we proposed a Network Embedding frameWork in MultIplex Network (NEWMIN) to predict synthetic drug combinations. Based on a multiplex drug similarity network, we offered alternative methods to integrate useful information from different aspects and to decide the quantitative importance of each network. For drug combination prediction, we found seven novel drug combinations that have been validated by external sources among the top-ranked predictions of our model. To verify the feasibility of NEWMIN, we compared NEWMIN with other five methods, for which it showed better performance than other methods in terms of the area under the precision-recall curve and receiver operating characteristic curve.

CMR enables accurate quantification of the cardiac chamber volume, ejection fraction and myocardial mass, providing information for diagnosis and monitoring of CVDs. However, for years, clinicians have been relying on manual approaches for CMR image analysis, which is time consuming and prone to subjective errors. It is a major clinical challenge to automatically derive quantitative and clinically relevant information from CMR images. Methods: Deep neural networks have shown a great potential in image pattern recognition and segmentation for a variety of tasks. Here we demonstrate an automated analysis method for CMR images, which is based on a fully convolutional network (FCN). The network is trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset from the UK Biobank, consisting of 4,875 subjects with 93,500 pixelwise annotated images. The performance of the method has been evaluated using a number of technical metrics, including the Dice metric, mean contour distance and Hausdorff distance, as well as clinically relevant measures, including left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV mass (LVM); right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and end-systolic volume (RVESV). Results: By combining FCN with a large-scale annotated dataset, the proposed automated method achieves a high performance in segmenting the LV and RV on short-axis CMR images and the left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) on long-axis CMR images. On a short-axis image test set of 600 subjects, it achieves an average Dice metric of 0.94 for the LV cavity, 0.88 for the LV myocardium and 0.90 for the RV cavity. The mean absolute difference between automated measurement and manual measurement is 6.1 mL for LVEDV, 5.3 mL for LVESV, 6.9 gram for LVM, 8.5 mL for RVEDV and 7.2 mL for RVESV. On long-axis image test sets, the average Dice metric is 0.93 for the LA cavity (2-chamber view), 0.95 for the LA cavity (4-chamber view) and 0.96 for the RA cavity (4-chamber view). The performance is comparable to human inter-observer variability. Conclusions: We show that an automated method achieves a performance on par with human experts in analysing CMR images and deriving clinically relevant measures.

Recently, a few deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks, CNNs) have been proposed to learn task-oriented features from sMRI for AD diagnosis, and achieved superior performance than the conventional learning-based methods using hand-crafted features. However, these existing CNN-based methods still require the pre-determination of informative locations in sMRI. That is, the stage of discriminative atrophy localization is isolated to the latter stages of feature extraction and classifier construction. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical fully convolutional network (H-FCN) to automatically identify discriminative local patches and regions in the whole brain sMRI, upon which multi-scale feature representations are then jointly learned and fused to construct hierarchical classification models for AD diagnosis. Our proposed H-FCN method was evaluated on a large cohort of subjects from two independent datasets (i.e., ADNI-1 and ADNI-2), demonstrating good performance on joint discriminative atrophy localization and brain disease diagnosis.

With this progressive growth, it is extremely important to ensure that healthy food is available for the survival of the inhabitants of this planet. Also, the economy of developing countries is highly dependent on agricultural production. The overall economic balance gets affected if there is a variance in the demand and supply of food or agricultural products. Diseases in plants are a great threat to the yield of the crops thereby causing famines and economy slow down. Our present study focuses on applying machine learning model for classifying tomato disease image dataset to proactively take necessary steps to combat such agricultural crisis. In this work, the dataset is collected from publicly available plant-village dataset. The significant features are extracted from the dataset using the hybrid-principal component analysis-Whale optimization algorithm. Further the extracted data are fed into a deep neural network for classification of tomato diseases. The proposed model is then evaluated with the classical machine learning techniques to establish the superiority in terms of accuracy and loss rate metrics.

Traditional Vegetation Management operational practices have proven ineffective and are rapidly becoming obsolete due to the lack of frequent inspection of vegetation and environmental states. The rise of satellite imagery data and machine learning provides an opportunity to close the loop with continuous data-driven vegetation monitoring. This paper proposes an automated framework for monitoring vegetation along power lines using high-resolution satellite imagery and a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm. The proposed satellite-based vegetation monitoring framework aims to reduce the cost and time of power line monitoring by partially replacing ground patrols and helicopter or drone inspection with satellite data analytics. It is implemented and demonstrated for a power distribution system operator (DSO) in the west of Norway. For further assessment, the satellite-based algorithm outcomes are compared with LiDAR survey data collected by helicopters. The results show the potential of the solution for reducing the monitoring costs for electric utilities.

Convergence rate analysis of proximal gradient methods with applications to composite minimization problems	OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Accretive operator; convex minimization problem; forward-backward splitting algorithm; Mann iteration method; S-iteration method	MANN ITERATIONS; POINT ALGORITHM; MONOTONE	First-order methods such as proximal gradient, which use Forward-Backward Splitting techniques have proved to be very effective in solving nonsmooth convex minimization problem, which is useful in solving various practical problems in different fields such as machine learning and image processing. In this paper, we propose few new forward-backward splitting algorithms, which consume less number of iterations to converge to an optimum. In addition, we derive convergence rates for the proposed formulations and show that the speed of convergence of these algorithms is significantly better than the traditional forward-backward algorithm. To demonstrate the practical applicability, we apply them to two real-world problems of machine learning and image processing. The first issue deals with the regression on high-dimensional datasets, whereas the second one is the image deblurring problem. Numerical experiments have been conducted on several publicly available real datasets to verify the obtained theoretical results. Results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms in terms of accuracy, the number of iterations required to converge and the rate of convergence against the classical first-order methods.

Quantum convolutional neural networks	NATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS; INFORMATION; DEEP	Neural network-based machine learning has recently proven successful for many complex applications ranging from image recognition to precision medicine. However, its direct application to problems in quantum physics is challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body systems. Motivated by recent advances in realizing quantum information processors, we introduce and analyse a quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, a highly effective model in machine learning. Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) uses only O(log(N)) variational parameters for input sizes of N qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. To explicitly illustrate its capabilities, we show that QCNNs can accurately recognize quantum states associated with a one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phase, with performance surpassing existing approaches. We further demonstrate that QCNNs can be used to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given, unknown error model that substantially outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. The potential experimental realizations and generalizations of QCNNs are also discussed.

For this purpose, a novel composite framework integrating time varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD), fuzzy entropy (FE) theory, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), phase space reconstruction (PSR), compound prediction models adopting kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) and convolutional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM) as well as mutation and hierarchy-based hybrid optimization algorithm, is proposed in this paper. Among the supplementary strategies, TVF-EMD, FE and SSA are employed to achieve non-stationary raw series attenuation, aggregation for approximate IMFs as well as separation of dominant and residuary ingredients from the aggregated IMFs, respectively. Besides, parameters of PSR and KELM as well as wrapper method-based feature selection (FS) for input combination are synchronously optimized by the newly developed swarm optimizer integrating Harris hawks optimization (HHO) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO) with mutation operator and hierarchy strategy. Meanwhile, such hybrid structure is adopted to predict the preprocessed high-frequency components, while the remaining component is predicted by ConvLSTM cells-based deep learning network. Subsequently, the ultimate forecasting results of the raw wind speed are calculated by superimposing the predicted values of all components. Four datasets collected from various sites with two different time intervals and nine relevant contrastive models are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach, where the corresponding results demonstrate that: (1) data preprocessing strategy applying TVF-EMD and FE theory can significantly reduce the time consumption of the entire model without decreasing forecasting performance; (2) SSA-based dominant ingredients extraction can further improve the forecasting capability of combined model; (3) the proposed MHHOGWO can synchronously accomplish parameters optimization and FS effectively, thus improving the forecasting effectiveness of the entire model significantly; (4) the proposed compound prediction models based on KELM and ConvLSTM can exert the capabilities of each model adequately as well as ulteriorly reducing computational requirements.

In this paper, we address this visibility problem by focusing on single-image rain removal, even in the presence of dense rain streaks and rain-streak accumulation, which is visually similar to mist or fog. To achieve this, we introduce a new rain model and a deep learning architecture. Our rain model incorporates a binary rain map indicating rain-streak regions, and accommodates various shapes, directions, and sizes of overlapping rain streaks, as well as rain accumulation, to model heavy rain. Based on this model, we construct a multi-task deep network, which jointly learns three targets: the binary rain-streak map, rain streak layers, and clean background, which is our ultimate output. To generate features that can be invariant to rain steaks, we introduce a contextual dilated network, which is able to exploit regional contextual information. To handle various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, our strategy is to utilize a recurrent process that progressively removes rain streaks. Our binary map provides a constraint and thus additional information to train our network. Extensive evaluation on real images, particularly in heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our model and architecture.

Nevertheless, HFR is confronted with challenges from large domain discrepancy and insufficient heterogeneous data. In this paper, we formulate HFR as a dual generation problem, and tackle it via a novel dual variational generation (DVG-Face) framework. Specifically, a dual variational generator is elaborately designed to learn the joint distribution of paired heterogeneous images. However, the small-scale paired heterogeneous training data may limit the identity diversity of sampling. In order to break through the limitation, we propose to integrate abundant identity information of large-scale visible data into the joint distribution. Furthermore, a pairwise identity preserving loss is imposed on the generated paired heterogeneous images to ensure their identity consistency. As a consequence, massive new diverse paired heterogeneous images with the same identity can be generated from noises. The identity consistency and identity diversity properties allow us to employ these generated images to train the HFR network via a contrastive learning mechanism, yielding both domain-invariant and discriminative embedding features. Concretely, the generated paired heterogeneous images are regarded as positive pairs, and the images obtained from different samplings are considered as negative pairs. Our method achieves superior performances over state-of-the-art methods on seven challenging databases belonging to five HFR tasks, including NIR-VIS, Sketch-Photo, Profile-Frontal Photo, Thermal-VIS, and ID-Camera.

J	Wu, CY; Wang, JZ; Chen, XJ; Du, P; Yang, WD				Wu, Chunying; Wang, Jianzhou; Chen, Xuejun; Du, Pei; Yang, Wendong			A novel hybrid system based on multi-objective optimization for wind speed forecasting	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Wind speed forecasting; Multi-objective grey wolf optimization; Hybrid forecasting system; Forecasting accuracy and stability	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; POWER; ALGORITHM; PREDICTION; MULTISTEP; ACCURACY; EMD	Wind power has demonstrated high-efficiency utilization in electricity system, accordingly, accurate and stable forecasting of wind speed is of vital significance in power grid security management and market economics. However, most former studies only consider either the accuracy or stability, with difficulty achieving the two targets simultaneously, which is insufficient for an effective forecasting method. This paper proposes a novel hybrid forecasting system that includes an effective data decomposition technique, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, a forecasting algorithm, and a set of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this system, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) divides the original wind speed sequence into a set of intrinsic mode functions and then extreme learning machine (ELM) optimized by the multi-objective grey wolf optimization (MOGWO) is applied to achieve excellent forecasting performance. To validate the forecasting performance of the developed forecasting system, wind speed data at 10-min interval collected from Shandong Peninsula, China is considered as case study and comprehensive evaluations are introduced. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid system transcends the other compared single and traditional models and simultaneously realizes high accuracy and strong stability. Thus, the proposed CEEMD-MOGWO-ELM system can be effectively and satisfactorily used for smart-grid operation and management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gregory			Optimizing taxonomic classification of marker-gene amplicon sequences with QIIME 2 ' s q2-feature-classifier plugin	MICROBIOME			English	Article							BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER; PRIMERS; IDENTIFICATION; DIVERSITY; SELECTION	Background: Taxonomic classification of marker-gene sequences is an important step in microbiome analysis. Results: We present q2-feature-classifier (https://github.corn/qiime2/q2 feature classifier), a QIIME 2 plugin containing several novel machine-learning and alignment-based methods for taxonomy classification. We evaluated and optimized several commonly used classification methods implemented in QIIME 1 (RDP, BLAST, UCLUST, and SortMeRNA) and several new methods implemented in QIIME 2 (a scikit-learn naive Bayes machine-learning classifier, and alignment-based taxonomy consensus methods based on VSEARCH, and BLAST+) for classification of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker-gene amplicon sequence data. The naive-Bayes, BLAST+-based, and VSEARCH-based classifiers implemented in QIIME 2 meet or exceed the species-level accuracy of other commonly used methods designed for classification of marker gene sequences that were evaluated in this work. These evaluations, based on 19 mock communities and error-free sequence simulations, including classification of simulated "novel" marker-gene sequences, are available in our extensible benchmarking framework, tax-credit (https://github.comkaporaso lab/tax credit data). Conclusions: Our results illustrate the importance of parameter tuning for optimizing classifier performance, and we make recommendations regarding parameter choices for these classifiers under a range of standard operating conditions. q2-feature-classifier and tax-credit are both free, open-source, BSD-licensed packages available on GitHub.

Ciro; Vargas, Doris Esenarro			Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms for Guessing Attack Protection in Complex Internet of Things Applications	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							SCHEME	As the world keeps advancing, the need for automated interconnected devices has started to gain significance; to cater to the condition, a new concept Internet of Things (IoT) has been introduced that revolves around smart devices' conception. These smart devices using IoT can communicate with each other through a network to attain particular objectives, i.e., automation and intelligent decision making. IoT has enabled the users to divide their household burden with machines as these complex machines look after the environment variables and control their behavior accordingly. As evident, these machines use sensors to collect vital information, which is then the complexity analyzed at a computational node that then smartly controls these devices' operational behaviors. Deep learning-based guessing attack protection algorithms have been enhancing IoT security; however, it still has a critical challenge for the complex industries' IoT networks. One of the crucial aspects of such systems is the need to have a significant training time for processing a large dataset from the network's previous flow of data. Traditional deep learning approaches include decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines. However, it is essential to note that this convenience comes with a price that involves security vulnerabilities as IoT networks are prone to be interfered with by hackers who can access the sensor/communication data and later utilize it for malicious purposes. This paper presents the experimental study of cryptographic algorithms to classify the types of encryption algorithms into the asymmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithm. It presents a deep analysis of AES, DES, 3DES, RSA, and Blowfish based on timing complexity, size, encryption, and decryption performances. It has been assessed in terms of the guessing attack in real-time deep learning complex IoT applications. The assessment has been done using the simulation approach and it has been tested the speed of encryption and decryption of the selected encryption algorithms. For each encryption and decryption, the tests executed the same encryption using the same plaintext for five separate times, and the average time is compared. The key size used for each encryption algorithm is the maximum bytes the cipher can allow. To the comparison, the average time required to compute the algorithm by the three devices is used. For the experimental test, a set of plaintexts is used in the simulation-password-sized text and paragraph-sized text-that achieves target fair results compared to the existing algorithms in real-time deep learning networks for IoT applications.

Improving the performance of small object detection has a wider significance in many real-world applications, such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robotics. In this article, the first-ever survey of recent studies in deep learning-based small object detection is presented. Our review begins with a brief introduction of the four pillars for small object detection, including multiscale representation, contextual information, super-resolution, and region-proposal. Then, the collection of state-of-the-art datasets for small object detection is listed. The performance of different methods on these datasets is reported later. Moreover, the state-of-the-art small object detection networks are investigated along with a special focus on the differences and modifications to improve the detection performance comparing to generic object detection architectures.

A Hybrid Feature Extraction Method for Nepali COVID-19-Related Tweets Classification	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article								COVID-19 is one of the deadliest viruses, which has killed millions of people around the world to this date. The reason for peoples' death is not only linked to its infection but also to peoples' mental states and sentiments triggered by the fear of the virus. People's sentiments, which are predominantly available in the form of posts/tweets on social media, can be interpreted using two kinds of information: syntactical and semantic. Herein, we propose to analyze peoples' sentiment using both kinds of information (syntactical and semantic) on the COVID-19-related twitter dataset available in the Nepali language. For this, we, first, use two widely used text representation methods: TF-IDF and FastText and then combine them to achieve the hybrid features to capture the highly discriminating features. Second, we implement nine widely used machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extreme Tree classifier, AdaBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron), based on the three feature representation methods: TF-IDF, FastText, and Hybrid. To evaluate our methods, we use a publicly available Nepali-COVID-19 tweets dataset, NepCov19Tweets, which consists of Nepali tweets categorized into three classes (Positive, Negative, and Neutral). The evaluation results on the NepCOV19Tweets show that the hybrid feature extraction method not only outperforms the other two individual feature extraction methods while using nine different machine learning algorithms but also provides excellent performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

UNSUPERVISED FEATURE-SELECTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; SPARSE REGRESSION; LOW-RANK; ALGORITHM; GRAPH	Feature selection (FS), which identifies the relevant features in a data set to facilitate subsequent data analysis, is a fundamental problem in machine learning and has been widely studied in recent years. Most FS methods rank the features in order of their scores based on a specific criterion and then select the k top-ranked features, where k is the number of desired features. However, these features are usually not the top-k features and may present a suboptimal choice. To address this issue, we propose a novel FS framework in this article to select the exact top-k features in the unsupervised, semisupervised, and supervised scenarios. The new framework utilizes the l(0,2)-norm as the matrix sparsity constraint rather than its relaxations, such as the l(1,2-)norm. Since the l(0,2)-norm constrained problem is difficult to solve, we transform the discrete l(0,2)-norm-based constraint into an equivalent 0-1 integer constraint and replace the 0-1 integer constraint with two continuous constraints. The obtained top-k FS framework with two continuous constraints is theoretically equivalent to the l(0,2)-norm constrained problem and can be optimized by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Unsupervised and semisupervised FS methods are developed based on the proposed framework, and extensive experiments on real-world data sets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FS framework.

For better understanding of their functional mechanisms, it is fundamentally important to identify 4mCmodification. Machine learning methods have recently emerged as an effective and efficient approach for the high-throughput identification of 4mC sites, although high predictive error rates are still challenging for existing methods. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a computational method to more accurately identify m4C sites. Results: In this study, we propose a machine learning based predictor, namely 4mcPred-SVM, for the genome-wide detection of DNA 4mC sites. In this predictor, we present a new feature representation algorithm that sufficiently exploits sequence-based information. To improve the feature representation ability, we use a two-step feature optimization strategy, thereby obtaining the most representative features. Using the resulting features and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we adaptively train the optimal models for different species. Comparative results on benchmark datasets from six species indicate that our predictor is able to achieve generally better performance in predicting 4mC sites as compared to the state-of-the-art predictors. Importantly, the sequence-based features can reliably and robust predict 4mC sites, facilitating the discovery of potentially important sequence characteristics for the prediction of 4mC sites. Availability and implementation: The user-friendly webserver that implements the proposed 4mcPred-SVM is well established, and is freely accessible at http://server.malab.cn/4mcPred-SVM.

Integrating information flows with energy flows, smart grids can help to solve the problem of electricity theft owning to the availability of massive data generated from smart grids. The data analysis on the data of smart grids is helpful in detecting electricity theft because of the abnormal electricity consumption pattern of energy thieves. However, the existing methods have poor detection accuracy of electricity theft since most of them were conducted on one-dimensional (1-D) electricity consumption data and failed to capture the periodicity of electricity consumption. In this paper, we originally propose a novel electricity-theft detection method based on wide and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to address the above concerns. In particular, wide and deep CNN model consists of two components: the wide component and the deep CNN component. The deep CNN component can accurately identify the nonperiodicity of electricity theft and the periodicity of normal electricity usage based on 2-D electricity consumption data. Meanwhile, the wide component can capture the global features of 1-D electricity consumption data. As a result, wide and deep CNN model can achieve the excellent performance in electricity-theft detection. Extensive experiments based on realistic dataset show that wide and deep CNN model outperforms other existing methods.

This causes penetrations and voltage surges, system instability, inefficient utilities planning and financial loss. Forecast models can help; however, time stamp, forecast horizon, input correlation analysis, data pre and post-processing, weather classification, network optimization, uncertainty quantification and performance evaluations need consideration. Thus, contemporary forecasting techniques are reviewed and evaluated. Input correlational analyses reveal that solar irradiance is most correlated with Photovoltaic output, and so, weather classification and cloud motion study are crucial. Moreover, the best data cleansing processes: normalization and wavelet transforms, and augmentation using generative adversarial network are recommended for network training and forecasting. Furthermore, optimization of inputs and network parameters, using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, is emphasized. Next, established performance evaluation metrics MAE, RMSE and MAPE are discussed, with suggestions for including economic utility metrics. Subsequently, modelling approaches are critiqued, objectively compared and categorized into physical, statistical, artificial intelligence, ensemble and hybrid approaches. It is determined that ensembles of artificial neural networks are best for forecasting short term photovoltaic power forecast and online sequential extreme learning machine superb for adaptive networks; while Bootstrap technique optimum for estimating uncertainty. Additionally, convolutional neural network is found to excel in eliciting a model's deep underlying non-linear input-output relationships. The conclusions drawn impart fresh insights in photovoltaic power forecast initiatives, especially in the use of hybrid artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.

Humans on the other hand are experts at multi-modal thinking and can embed new inputs almost instantly into a conceptual knowledge space shaped by experience. In many fields the aim is to build systems capable of explaining themselves, engaging in interactive what-if questions. Such questions, called counterfactuals, are becoming important in the rising field of explainable AI (xAI). Our central hypothesis is that using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality will help to train more explainable, more robust and less biased machine learning models, ideally able to learn from fewer data. One important aspect in the medical domain is that various modalities contribute to one single result. Our main question is ?How can we construct a multi-modal feature representation space (spanning images, text, genomics data) using knowledge bases as an initial connector for the development of novel explanation interface techniques???. In this paper we argue for using Graph Neural Networks as a method-of-choice, enabling information fusion for multi-modal causability (causability ? not to confuse with causality ? is the measurable extent to which an explanation to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding). The aim of this paper is to motivate the international xAI community to further work into the fields of multi-modal embeddings and interactive explainability, to lay the foundations for effective future human?AI interfaces. We emphasize that Graph Neural Networks play a major role for multi-modal causability, since causal links between features can be defined directly using graph structures.

A case study of humpback whale song	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						song; cultural evolution; cultural revolution; complexity; cetaceans; social learning	MEGAPTERA-NOVAEANGLIAE; GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION; TOOL USE; TRANSMISSION; ANIMALS; HAWAIIAN; LANGUAGE	Culture presents a second inheritance system by which innovations can be transmitted between generations and among individuals. Some vocal behaviours present compelling examples of cultural evolution. Where modifications accumulate over time, such a process can become cumulative cultural evolution. The existence of cumulative cultural evolution in non-human animals is controversial. When physical products of such a process do not exist, modifications may not be clearly visible over time. Here, we investigate whether the constantly evolving songs of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are indicative of cumulative cultural evolution. Using nine years of song data recorded from the New Caledonian humpback whale population, we quantified song evolution and complexity, and formally evaluated this process in light of criteria for cumulative cultural evolution. Song accumulates changes shown by an increase in complexity, but this process is punctuated by rapid loss of song material. While such changes tentatively satisfy the core criteria for cumulative cultural evolution, this claim hinges on the assumption that novel songs are preferred by females. While parsimonious, until such time as studies can link fitness benefits (reproductive success) to individual singers, any claims that humpback whale song evolution represents a form of cumulative cultural evolution may remain open to interpretation. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.

The investors' etiquettes towards stock market may demand the need of studying various associated factors and extract the useful information for reliable forecasting. Fusion can be considered as an approach to integrate data or characteristics, in general, and enhance the prediction based on the combinational approach that can aid each other. We conduct a systematic approach to present a survey for the years 2011-2020 by considering articles that have used fusion techniques for various stock market applications and broadly categorize them into information fusion, feature fusion, and model fusion. The major applications of stock market include stock price and trend prediction, risk analysis and return forecasting, index prediction, as well as portfolio management. We also provide an infographic overview of fusion in stock market prediction and extend our survey for other finely addressed financial prediction problems. Based on our surveyed articles, we provide potential future directions and concluding remarks on the significance of applying fusion in stock market.

J	Li, K; Cheng, G; Bu, SH; You, X				Li, Ke; Cheng, Gong; Bu, Shuhui; You, Xiong			Rotation-Insensitive and Context-Augmented Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); object detection; remote sensing images; restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)	GRADIENTS; SALIENCY	Most of the existing deep-learning-based methods are difficult to effectively deal with the challenges faced for geospatial object detection such as rotation variations and appearance ambiguity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel deep-learning-based object detection framework including region proposal network (RPN) and local-contextual feature fusion network designed for remote sensing images. Specifically, the RPN includes additional multiangle anchors besides the conventional multiscale and multiaspect-ratio ones, and thus can deal with the multiangle and multiscale characteristics of geospatial objects. To address the appearance ambiguity problem, we propose a double-channel feature fusion network that can learn local and contextual properties along two independent pathways. The two kinds of features are later combined in the final layers of processing in order to form a powerful joint representation. Comprehensive evaluations on a publicly available ten-class object detection data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease named COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in other parts of the world, the World Health Organization declared a state of emergency. In this paper, we used automated extraction of COVID-19-related discussions from social media and a natural language process (NLP) method based on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public opinions. Moreover, we also investigate how to use LSTM recurrent neural network for sentiment classification of COVID-19 comments. Our findings shed light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related decision-making. In addition, experiments demonstrated that the research model achieved an accuracy of 81.15% - a higher accuracy than that of several other well-known machine-learning algorithms for COVID-19-Sentiment Classification.

J	Cao, B; Zhang, L; Li, Y; Feng, DQ; Cao, W				Cao, Bin; Zhang, Long; Li, Yun; Feng, Daquan; Cao, Wei			Intelligent Offloading in Multi-Access Edge Computing: A State-of-the-Art Review and Framework	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE			English	Review								Multi-access edge computing (MEC), which is deployed in the proximity area of the mobile user side as a supplement to the traditional remote cloud center, has been regarded as a promising technique for 5G heterogeneous networks. With the assistance of MEC, mobile users can access computing resource effectively. Also, congestion in the core network can be alleviated by offloading. To adapt in stochastic and constantly varying environments, augmented intelligence (AI) is introduced in MEC for intelligent decision making. For this reason, several recent works have focused on intelligent offloading in MEC to harvest its potential benefits. Therefore, machine learning (ML)-based approaches, including reinforcement learning, supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning, as well as deep reinforcement learning for AI in MEC have become hot topics. However, many technical challenges still remain to be addressed for AI in MEC. In this article, the basic concept of MEC and main applications are introduced, and existing fundamental works using various ML-based approaches are reviewed. Furthermore, some potential issues of AI in MEC for future work are discussed.

J	Behler, J				Behler, Joerg			Four Generations of High-Dimensional Neural Network Potentials	CHEMICAL REVIEWS			English	Review							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; PROTON-TRANSFER MECHANISMS; MACHINE LEARNING-MODELS; AQUEOUS NAOH SOLUTIONS; ENERGY SURFACES; FORCE-FIELD; CHARGE EQUILIBRATION; ATOMIC CHARGES; WATER CLUSTERS	Since their introduction about 25 years ago, machine learning (ML) potentials have become an important tool in the field of atomistic simulations. After the initial decade, in which neural networks were successfully used to construct potentials for rather small molecular systems, the development of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) in 2007 opened the way for the application of ML potentials in simulations of large systems containing thousands of atoms. To date, many other types of ML potentials have been proposed continuously increasing the range of problems that can be studied. In this review, the methodology of the family of HDNNPs including new recent developments will be discussed using a classification scheme into four generations of potentials, which is also applicable to many other types of ML potentials. The first generation is formed by early neural network potentials designed for low-dimensional systems. High-dimensional neural network potentials established the second generation and are based on three key steps: first, the expression of the total energy as a sum of environmentdependent atomic energy contributions; second, the description of the atomic environments by atom-centered symmetry functions as descriptors fulfilling the requirements of rotational, translational, and permutation invariance; and third, the iterative construction of the reference electronic structure data sets by active learning. In third-generation HDNNPs, in addition, long-range interactions are included employing environment-dependent partial charges expressed by atomic neural networks. In fourth-generation HDNNPs, which are just emerging, in addition, nonlocal phenomena such as long-range charge transfer can be included. The applicability and remaining limitations of HDNNPs are discussed along with an outlook at possible future developments.

Many practical applications, however, require predictions at more granular timescales. For instance, accurate prediction of short but extreme flood peaks can make a life-saving difference, yet such peaks may escape the coarse temporal resolution of daily predictions. Naively training an LSTM on hourly data, however, entails very long input sequences that make learning difficult and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose two multi-timescale LSTM (MTS-LSTM) architectures that jointly predict multiple timescales within one model, as they process long-past inputs at a different temporal resolution than more recent inputs. In a benchmark on 516 basins across the continental United States, these models achieved significantly higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values than the US National Water Model. Compared to naive prediction with distinct LSTMs per timescale, the multi-timescale architectures are computationally more efficient with no loss in accuracy. Beyond prediction quality, the multi-timescale LSTM can process different input variables at different timescales, which is especially relevant to operational applications where the lead time of meteorological forcings depends on their temporal resolution.

This technique has become an essential part of a wide range of applications including politics, business, advertising and marketing. There are various techniques for sentiment analysis, but recently word embeddings methods have been widely used in sentiment classification tasks. Word2Vec and GloVe are currently among the most accurate and usable word embedding methods which can convert words into meaningful vectors. However, these methods ignore sentiment information of texts and need a large corpus of texts for training and generating exact vectors. As a result, because of the small size of some corpora, researcher often have to use pre-trained word embeddings which were trained on other large text corpora such as Google News with about 100 billion words. The increasing accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings has a great impact on sentiment analysis research. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Improved Word Vectors (IWV), which increases the accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings in sentiment analysis. Our method is based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging techniques, lexicon-based approaches, word position algorithm and Word2Vec/GloVe methods. We tested the accuracy of our method via different deep learning models and benchmark sentiment datasets. Our experiment results show that Improved Word Vectors (IWV) are very effective for sentiment analysis. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly a set of advanced computational algorithms that basically learn the patterns in the data provided to make predictions on unseen data sets. Radiomics can be coupled with Al because of its better capability of handling a massive amount of data compared with the traditional statistical methods. Together, the primary purpose of these fields is to extract and analyze as much and meaningful hidden quantitative data as possible to be used in decision support. Nowadays, both radiornics and Al have been getting attention for their remarkable success in various radiological tasks, which has been met with anxiety by most of the radiologists due to the fear of replacement by intelligent machines. Considering ever-developing advances inn computational power and availability of large data sets, the marriage of humans and machines in future clinical practice seems inevitable. Therefore, regardless of their feelings, the radiologists should be familiar with these concepts. Our goal in this paper was three-fold: first, to familiarize radiologists with the radiomics and Al; second, to encourage the radiologists to get involved in these ever-developing fields; and, third, to provide a set of recommendations for good practice in design and assessment of future works.

J	Hughes, TW; Minkov, M; Shi, Y; Fan, SH				Hughes, Tyler W.; Minkov, Momchil; Shi, Yu; Fan, Shanhui			Training of photonic neural networks through in situ backpropagation and gradient measurement	OPTICA			English	Article							DESIGN	Recently, integrated optics has gained interest as a hardware platform for implementing machine learning algorithms. Of particular interest are artificial neural networks, since matrix-vector multiplications, which are used heavily in artificial neural networks, can be done efficiently in photonic circuits. The training of an artificial neural network is a crucial step in its application. However, currently on the integrated photonics platform there is no efficient protocol for the training of these networks. In this work, we introduce a method that enables highly efficient, in situ training of a photonic neural network. We use adjoint variable methods to derive the photonic analogue of the backpropagation algorithm, which is the standard method for computing gradients of conventional neural networks. We further show how these gradients may be obtained exactly by performing intensity measurements within the device. As an application, we demonstrate the training of a numerically simulated photonic artificial neural network. Beyond the training of photonic machine learning implementations, our method may also be of broad interest to experimental sensitivity analysis of photonic systems and the optimization of reconfigurable optics platforms.

The enormous divergence of signalling and transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer, stromal and immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers based on a single gene or protein. However, the result of these complex processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has led to the advent of artificial intelligence (Al) and machine learning tools in digital pathology, which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and might, ultimately, improve patient management. In this Perspective, we critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital pathology, focusing on deep neural networks and 'hand-crafted' feature-based methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating Al and machine learning tools into clinical oncology, with an emphasis on biomarker development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of Al, including the need for well-curated validation datasets, regulatory approval and fair reimbursement strategies. Finally, we present potential future opportunities for precision oncology.

Uncovering the 'dark matter' of nutrition could open new avenues for a greater understanding of the composition of what we eat and how it relates to health and disease Our understanding of how diet affects health is limited to 150 key nutritional components that are tracked and catalogued by the United States Department of Agriculture and other national databases. Although this knowledge has been transformative for health sciences, helping unveil the role of calories, sugar, fat, vitamins and other nutritional factors in the emergence of common diseases, these nutritional components represent only a small fraction of the more than 26,000 distinct, definable biochemicals present in our food-many of which have documented effects on health but remain unquantified in any systematic fashion across different individual foods. Using new advances such as machine learning, a high-resolution library of these biochemicals could enable the systematic study of the full biochemical spectrum of our diets, opening new avenues for understanding the composition of what we eat, and how it affects health and disease.

This article attempts to present a comprehensive survey on surface defect detection technologies by reviewing about 120 publications over the last two decades for three typical flat steel products of con-casting slabs and hot- and cold-rolled steel strips. According to the nature of algorithms as well as image features, the existing methodologies are categorized into four groups: statistical, spectral, model-based, and machine learning. These works are summarized in this review to enable easy referral to suitable methods for diverse application scenarios in steel mills. Realization recommendations and future research trends are also addressed at an abstract level.

Then we investigate the joint trajectory design and power allocation for static NOMA users based on a simplified 2D model of UAV flying around at fixed height. As a further advance, we demonstrate the UAV placement issue with the aid of machine learning techniques when the ground users are roaming and the UAVs are capable of adjusting their positions in three dimensions accordingly. With these case studies, we can comprehensively understand the UAV systems from fundamental theory to practical implementation.

J	Gu, SK; Cheng, R; Jin, YC				Gu, Shenkai; Cheng, Ran; Jin, Yaochu			Feature selection for high-dimensional classification using a competitive swarm optimizer	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Feature selection; High dimensionality; Large-scale optimization; Classification; Competitive swarm optimization	COMBINATORIAL; ALGORITHM	When solving many machine learning problems such as classification, there exists a large number of input features. However, not all features are relevant for solving the problem, and sometimes, including irrelevant features may deteriorate the learning performance.Please check the edit made in the article title Therefore, it is essential to select the most relevant features, which is known as feature selection. Many feature selection algorithms have been developed, including evolutionary algorithms or particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, to find a subset of the most important features for accomplishing a particular machine learning task. However, the traditional PSO does not perform well for large-scale optimization problems, which degrades the effectiveness of PSO for feature selection when the number of features dramatically increases. In this paper, we propose to use a very recent PSO variant, known as competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) that was dedicated to large-scale optimization, for solving high-dimensional feature selection problems. In addition, the CSO, which was originally developed for continuous optimization, is adapted to perform feature selection that can be considered as a combinatorial optimization problem. An archive technique is also introduced to reduce computational cost. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that compared to the canonical PSO-based and a state-of-the-art PSO variant for feature selection, the proposed CSO-based feature selection algorithm not only selects a much smaller number of features, but result in better classification performance as well.

We extract and synthesise 130 research papers, considering two perspectives: (1) methodological framework and (2) methods for capturing spatial information. Spatial information boosts the accuracy of prediction, particularly in congested traffic regimes and for longer horizons. Machine learning methods, which have attracted more attention in recent years, outperform the naive statistical methods such as historical average and exponential smoothing. However, there is no guarantee of superiority when machine learning methods are compared with advanced statistical methods such as spatiotemporal autoregressive integrated moving average. As for the spatial dependency detection, a large gulf exists between the realistic spatial dependence of traffic links on a real network and the studied networks as follows: (1) studies capture spatial dependency of either adjacent or distant upstream and downstream links with the study link, (2) the spatially relevant links are selected either by prejudgment or by correlation-coefficient analysis, and (3) studies develop forecasting methods in a corridor test sample, where all links are connected sequentially together, assume a similarity between the behaviour of both parallel and adjacent links, and overlook the competitive nature of traffic links.

Particularly, learning deep hash functions has greatly improved the retrieval performance, typically under the semantic supervision. In contrast, current unsupervised deep hashing algorithms can hardly achieve satisfactory performance due to either the relaxed optimization or absence of similarity-sensitive objective. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised hashing framework, named Similarity-Adaptive Deep Hashing (SADH), which alternatingly proceeds over three training modules: deep hash model training, similarity graph updating and binary code optimization. The key difference from the widely-used two-step hashing method is that the output representations of the learned deep model help update the similarity graph matrix, which is then used to improve the subsequent code optimization. In addition, for producing high-quality binary codes, we devise an effective discrete optimization algorithm which can directly handle the binary constraints with a general hashing loss. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of SADH, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts by large gaps.

First, a total of 66 springs were identified by field surveys, out of which 70% of the spring locations were used for training the models and 30% of the spring locations were employed for the validation process. Second, a total of 14 affecting factors including aspect, altitude, slope, plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), sediment transport index (STI), lithology, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, soil, distance to roads, and distance to streams was used to analyze the spatial relationship between these affecting factors and spring occurrences. Multicollinearity analysis and feature selection of the correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) method were employed to optimize the affecting factors. Subsequently, the novel ensembles of the WoE, LR, and FT models were constructed using the training dataset. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, standard error, confidence interval (CI) at 95%, and significance level P were employed to validate and compare the performance of three models. Overall, all three models performed well for groundwater spring potential evaluation. The prediction capability of the FT model, with the highest AUC values, the smallest standard errors, the narrowest CIs, and the smallest P values for the training and validation datasets, is better compared to those of other models. The groundwater spring potential maps can be adopted for the management of water resources and land use by planners and engineers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A novel hybrid surrogate intelligent model for creep index prediction based on particle swarm optimization and random forest	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Creep; Soft clay; Machine learning; Optimization; Physical properties; Correlation	TIME-DEPENDENT BEHAVIOR; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; SHEAR-STRENGTH; SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOR; SOIL; SELECTION; STRESS; UNCERTAINTY; FRAMEWORK	Long-term settlement issues in engineering practice are controlled by the creep index, C-alpha, but current empirical models of C-alpha are not sufficiently reliable. In a departure from previous correlations, this study proposes a hybrid surrogate intelligent model for predicting C-alpha. The new combined model integrates a meta-heuristic particle optimization swarm (PSO) in the random forest (RF) to overcome the user experience dependence and local optimum problems. A total of 151 datasets having four parameters (liquid limit w(L), plasticity index I-p, void ratio e, clay content CI) and one output variable C-alpha are collected from the literature. Eleven combinations of these four parameters (one with four parameters, four with three parameters and six with two parameters) are used as input variables in the RF algorithm to determine the optimal combination of variables. In this novel model, PSO is employed to determine the optimal hyper-parameters in the RF algorithm, and the fitness function in the PSO is defined as the mean prediction error for 10 cross-validation sets to enhance the robustness of the RF model. The performance of the RF model is compared specifically with the existing empirical formulae. The results indicate that the combinations I-P-e, CI-I-P-e and CI-w(L)-I-p-e are optimal RF models in their respective groups, recommended for predicting C-alpha in engineering practice. Whats more, these three proposed models demonstrably outperform empirical methods, featuring as they do lower levels of prediction error. Parametric investigation indicates that the relationships between C-alpha and the four input variables in the proposed RF models harmonize with the physical explanation. A Gini index generated during the RF process indicates that C-alpha is much more sensitive to e than to CI, I-p and w(L), in that order - although the difference among the latter three variables can be negligible.

Tourists can now access different sources of information, and they can generate their own content and share their views and experiences. Tourism content shared through social media has become a very influential information source that impacts tourism in terms of both reputation and performance. However, the volume of data on the Internet has reached a level that makes manual processing almost impossible, demanding new analytical approaches. Sentiment analysis is rapidly emerging as an automated process of examining semantic relationships and meaning in reviews. In this article, different sentiment analysis approaches applied in tourism are reviewed and assessed in terms of the datasets used and performances on key evaluation metrics. The article concludes by outlining future research avenues to further advance sentiment analysis in tourism as part of a broader Big Data approach.

Accurate photovoltaic power prediction plays an important role in solving this problem. With the development of deep learning, more and more scholars have applied the deep learning model to time series prediction and achieved very good results. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model (LSTM-Convolutional Network) is proposed and applied to photovoltaic power prediction. In the proposed hybrid prediction model, the temporal features of the data are extracted first by the long-short term memory network, and then the spatial features of the data are extracted by the convolutional neural network model. In order to show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid prediction model, the prediction results of the hybrid model are compared with those of the single model (long-short term memory network, convolutional neural network) and the hybrid network (Convolutional-LSTM Network) model, and the results of eight error evaluation indexes are given. The results show that the hybrid prediction model has better prediction effect than the single prediction model, and the proposed hybrid model (extract the temporal characteristics of data first, and then extract the spatial characteristics of data) is better than Convolutional-LSTM Network (extract the spatial characteristics of data first, and then extract the temporal characteristics of data).

Financial crisis prediction model using ant colony optimization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bankruptcy prediction; Credit risk; Feature selection; Machine learning; Metaheuristic	FEATURE-SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DISTRESS; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM; RATIOS; SYSTEM; SAMPLE	Financial decisions are often based on classification models which are used to assign a set of observations into predefined groups. Different data classification models were developed to foresee the financial crisis of an organization using their historical data. One important step towards the development of accurate financial crisis prediction (FCP) model involves the selection of appropriate variables (features) which are relevant for the problems at hand. This is termed as feature selection problem which helps to improve the classification performance. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based financial crisis prediction (FCP) model which incorporates two phases: ACO based feature selection (ACO-FS) algorithm and ACO based data classification (ACO-DC) algorithm. The proposed ACO-FCP model is validated using a set of five benchmark dataset includes both qualitative and quantitative. For feature selection design, the developed ACO-FS method is compared with three existing feature selection algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. In addition, a comparison of classification results is also made between ACO-DC and state of art methods. Experimental analysis shows that the ACO-FCP ensemble model is superior and more robust than its counterparts. In consequence, this study strongly recommends that the proposed ACO-FCP model is highly competitive than traditional and other artificial intelligence techniques.

Thus, a novel predictor is desired to be established to identify 6mA sites in the Rosaceae genome. To the best of our knowledge, we first propose a computation model named i6mA-Fuse (Identification of N6-MethylAdenine sites by Fusing multiple feature representation) to predict 6mA sites from the Rosaceae genomes, especially in Rosa chinensis and Fragaria vesca. DNA N-6-methyladenine (6 mA) is one of the most vital epigenetic modifications and involved in controlling the various gene expression levels. With the avalanche of DNA sequences generated in numerous databases, the accurate identification of 6 mA plays an essential role for understanding molecular mechanisms. Because the experimental approaches are time-consuming and costly, it is desirable to develop a computation model for rapidly and accurately identifying 6 mA. To the best of our knowledge, we first proposed a computational model named i6mA-Fuse to predict 6 mA sites from the Rosaceae genomes, especially in Rosa chinensis and Fragaria vesca. We implemented the five encoding schemes, i.e., mononucleotide binary, dinucleotide binary, k-space spectral nucleotide, k-mer, and electron-ion interaction pseudo potential compositions, to build the five, single-encoding random forest (RF) models. The i6mA-Fuse uses a linear regression model to combine the predicted probability scores of the five, single encoding-based RF models. The resultant species-specific i6mA-Fuse achieved remarkably high performances with AUCs of 0.982 and 0.978 and with MCCs of 0.869 and 0.858 on the independent datasets of Rosa chinensis and Fragaria vesca, respectively.

Electrophysiological and transcriptomic correlates of neuropathic pain in human dorsal root ganglion neurons	BRAIN			English	Article						spontaneous activity; neuropathy; DRG transcriptomics; machine learning in healthcare	SENSORY NEURONS; RESPONSES; EXPRESSION; CHANNELS; TRPV1; GENE; DRG	Neuropathic pain encompasses a diverse array of clinical entities affecting 7-10% of the population, which is challenging to adequately treat. Several promising therapeutics derived from molecular discoveries in animal models of neuropathic pain have failed to translate following unsuccessful clinical trials suggesting the possibility of important cellular-level and molecular differences between animals and humans. Establishing the extent of potential differences between laboratory animals and humans, through direct study of human tissues and/or cells, is likely important in facilitating translation of preclinical discoveries to meaningful treatments. Patch-clamp electrophysiology and RNA-sequencing was performed on dorsal root ganglia taken from patients with variable presence of radicular/neuropathic pain. Findings establish that spontaneous action potential generation in dorsal root ganglion neurons is associated with radicular/neuropathic pain and radiographic nerve root compression. Transcriptome analysis suggests presence of sex-specific differences and reveals gene modules and signalling pathways in immune response and neuronal plasticity related to radicular/neuropathic pain that may suggest therapeutic avenues and that has the potential to predict neuropathic pain in future cohorts.

In this technical note we theoretically motivate and empirically validate an initialization strategy which can resolve the barren plateau problem for practical applications. The technique involves randomly selecting some of the initial parameter values, then choosing the remaining values so that the circuit is a sequence of shallow blocks that each evaluates to the identity. This initialization limits the effective depth of the circuits used to calculate the first parameter update so that they cannot be stuck in a barren plateau at the start of training. In turn, this makes some of the most compact ansatze usable in practice, which was not possible before even for rather basic problems. We show empirically that variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum neural networks initialized using this strategy can be trained using a gradient based method.

This endeavor spans a broad range of scientific areas including drug discovery, genetics/genomics, health communication, and causal inference, all in support of evidence-based, i.e., data-driven, decision making. Precision medicine is formalized as a treatment regime that comprises a sequence of decision rules, one per decision point, which map up-to-date patient information to a recommended action. The potential actions could be the selection of which drug to use, the selection of dose, the timing of administration, the recommendation of a specific diet or exercise, or other aspects of treatment or care. Statistics research in precision medicine is broadly focused on methodological development for estimation of and inference for treatment regimes that maximize some cumulative clinical outcome. In this review, we provide an overview of this vibrant area of research and present important and emerging challenges.

In this article, we tackle this challenging problem by aggregating the image-level information of all training images into a large knowledge graph and exploiting semantic relationships from this graph. Specifically, our effort starts with some generic segment-based object proposals (SOP) without category priors. We propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, which can be trained in an end-to-end manner using training images with image-level labels. For each proposal, this MIL framework can simultaneously compute probability distributions and category-aware semantic features, with which we can formulate a large undirected graph. The category of background is also included in this graph to remove the massive noisy object proposals. An optimal multi-way cut of this graph can thus assign a reliable category label to each proposal. The denoised SOP with assigned category labels can be viewed as pseudo instance segmentation of training images, which are used to train fully supervised models. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for both weakly supervised instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/yun-liu/LIID.

Since detected objects under surveillance are usually low-resolution and noisy, their accurate recognition represents a huge challenge. Knowledge distillation is an effective method to deal with it, but existing related work usually focuses on reducing the channel count of a student network, not feature map size. As a result, they cannot transfer "privilege information" hidden in feature maps of a wide and deep teacher network into a thin and shallow student one, leading to the latter's poor performance. To address this issue, we propose a Feature Map Distillation (FMD) framework under which the feature map size of teacher and student networks is different. FMD consists of two main components: Feature Decoder Distillation (FDD) and Feature Map Consistency-enforcement (FMC). FDD reconstructs the shallow texture features of a thin student network to approximate the corresponding samples in a teacher network, which allows the high-resolution ones to directly guide the learning of the shallow features of the student network. FMC makes the size and direction of each deep feature map consistent between student and teacher networks, which constrains each pair of feature maps to produce the same feature distribution. FDD and FMC allow a thin student network to learn rich "privilege information" in feature maps of a wide teacher network. The overall performance of FMD is verified in multiple recognition tasks by comparing it with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods on low-resolution and noisy objects.

However, the instability of data collection devices, complexity of pathogenesis, and ambiguity in the causes of the disease always introduce considerable uncertainty in identifying ASD using rs-fMRI. Due to the strong ability of Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference systems (TSK FISs) in handling the uncertainty of knowledge and expression, we build an ASD classification model based on TSK FISs and further propose a novel multicenter ASD classification method FCG-MTGS-TSK. Specifically, the correlation information of multiple imaging centers is considered by introducing multitask group sparse learning, and the features across multiple imaging centers are thus jointly selected. An augmented lagrange multiplier (ALM) method is further developed to find the optimal solution of the model. Compared with the other existing methods, the proposed method has the advantages of strong interpretability and high classification accuracy. The experimental results also identify the most discriminative functional connectivity in multicenter ASD classification.

J	Zhu, MH; Jiao, LC; Liu, F; Yang, SY; Wang, JN				Zhu, Minghao; Jiao, Licheng; Liu, Fang; Yang, Shuyuan; Wang, Jianing			Residual Spectral-Spatial Attention Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Hyperspectral imaging; Task analysis; Training; Adaptation models; Machine learning; Attention network; convolutional neural networks (CNNs); hyperspectral image(HSI) classification; residual spectral-spatial attention network (RSSAN); spatial attention; spectral attention	INFORMATION; AUTOENCODER; FUSION	In the last five years, deep learning has been introduced to tackle the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification and demonstrated good performance. In particular, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods for HSI classification have made great progress. However, due to the high dimensionality of HSI and equal treatment of all bands, the performance of these methods is hampered by learning features from useless bands for classification. Moreover, for patchwise-based CNN models, equal treatment of spatial information from the pixel-centered neighborhood also hinders the performance of these methods. In this article, we propose an end-to-end residual spectral-spatial attention network (RSSAN) for HSI classification. The RSSAN takes raw 3-D cubes as input data without additional feature engineering. First, a spectral attention module is designed for spectral band selection from raw input data by emphasizing useful bands for classification and suppressing useless bands. Then, a spatial attention module is designed for the adaptive selection of spatial information by emphasizing pixels from the same class as the center pixel or those are useful for classification in the pixel-centered neighborhood and suppressing those from a different class or useless. Second, two attention modules are also used in the following CNN for adaptive feature refinement in spectral-spatial feature learning. Third, a sequential spectral-spatial attention module is embedded into a residual block to avoid overfitting and accelerate the training of the proposed model. Experimental studies demonstrate that the RSSAN achieved superior classification accuracy compared with the state of the art on three HSI data sets: Indian Pines (IN), University of Pavia (UP), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC).

N3C Consortium	The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C): Rationale, design, infrastructure, and deployment	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						COVID-19; open science; clinical data model harmonization; EHR data; collaborative analytics; SARS-CoV-2	ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; DATA QUALITY; FUTURE; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLETENESS; ALGORITHM; PRIVACY; MODELS	Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses societal challenges that require expeditious data and knowledge sharing. Though organizational clinical data are abundant, these are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal analyses are most successful with large-scale data beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers. Materials and Methods: The Clinical and Translational Science Award Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics. Results: Organized in inclusive workstreams, we created legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access. Conclusions: The N3C has demonstrated that a multisite collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multiorganizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.

However, DNN trained by conventional methods with small datasets commonly shows worse performance than traditional machine learning methods, e.g. shallow neural network and support vector machine. This inherent limitation prevented the wide adoption of DNN in material study because collecting and assembling big dataset in material science is a challenge. In this study, we attempted to predict solidification defects by DNN regression with a small dataset that contains 487 data points. It is found that a pre-trained and fine-tuned DNN shows better generalization performance over shallow neural network, support vector machine, and DNN trained by conventional methods. The trained DNN transforms scattered experimental data points into a map of high accuracy in high-dimensional chemistry and processing parameters space. Though DNN with big datasets is the optimal solution, DNN with small datasets and pre-training can be a reasonable choice when big datasets are unavailable in material study. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Hunting for open clusters in Gaia DR2: 582 new open clusters in the Galactic disc	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						surveys; open clusters and associations: general; astrometry; methods: data analysis		Context. Open clusters are key targets for studies of Galaxy structure and evolution, and stellar physics. Since the Gaia data release 2 (DR2), the discovery of undetected clusters has shown that previous surveys were incomplete.Aims. Our aim is to exploit the Big Data capabilities of machine learning to detect new open clusters in Gaia DR2, and to complete the open cluster sample to enable further studies of the Galactic disc.Methods. We use a machine-learning based methodology to systematically search the Galactic disc for overdensities in the astrometric space and identify the open clusters using photometric information. First, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to blindly search for these overdensities in Gaia DR2 (l, b, , mu(*)(alpha), mu(delta)), and then we used a deep learning artificial neural network trained on colour-magnitude diagrams to identify isochrone patterns in these overdensities, and to confirm them as open clusters.Results. We find 582 new open clusters distributed along the Galactic disc in the region vertical bar b vertical bar < 20 degrees. We detect substructure in complex regions, and identify the tidal tails of a disrupting cluster UBC 274 of similar to 3 Gyr located at similar to 2 kpc.Conclusions. Adapting the mentioned methodology to a Big Data environment allows us to target the search using the physical properties of open clusters instead of being driven by computational limitations. This blind search for open clusters in the Galactic disc increases the number of known open clusters by 45%.

Existing experimental techniques for identifying CPPs are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, the prediction of CPPs from peptide sequences by using computational methods can be useful to annotate and guide the experimental process quickly. Many machine learning-based methods have recently emerged for identifying CPPs. Although considerable progress has been made, existing methods still have low feature representation capabilities, thereby limiting further performance improvements. Results: We propose a method called StackCPPred, which proposes three feature methods on the basis of the pairwise energy content of the residue as follows: RECM-composition, PseRECM and RECM-DWT. These features are used to train stacking-based machine learning methods to effectively predict CPPs. On the basis of the CPP924 and CPPsite3 datasets with jackknife validation, StackDPPred achieved 94.5% and 78.3% accuracy, which was 2.9% and 5.8% higher than the state-of-the-art CPP predictors, respectively. StackCPPred can be a powerful tool for predicting CPPs and their uptake efficiency, facilitating hypothesis-driven experimental design and accelerating their applications in clinical therapy.

In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution (DE). It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.

The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important to interpret the machine learning models to enhance trust management by allowing human experts to understand the underlying data evidence and causal reasoning. According to IDS, the critical role of trust management is to understand the impact of the malicious data to detect any intrusion in the system. The previous studies focused more on the accuracy of the various classification algorithms for trust in IDS. They do not often provide insights into their behavior and reasoning provided by the sophisticated algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we have addressed XAI concept to enhance trust management by exploring the decision tree model in the area of IDS. We use simple decision tree algorithms that can be easily read and even resemble a human approach to decision-making by splitting the choice into many small subchoices for IDS. We experimented with this approach by extracting rules in a widely used KDD benchmark dataset. We also compared the accuracy of the decision tree approach with the other state-of-the-art algorithms.

Quantifying forest vulnerability to disturbances and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, observational evidence is largely missing at regional to continental scales. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of European forests to fires, windthrows and insect outbreaks during the period 1979-2018 by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. We show that about 33.4 billion tonnes of forest biomass could be seriously affected by these disturbances, with higher relative losses when exposed to windthrows (40%) and fires (34%) compared to insect outbreaks (26%). The spatial pattern in vulnerability is strongly controlled by the interplay between forest characteristics and background climate. Hotspot regions for vulnerability are located at the borders of the climate envelope, in both southern and northern Europe. There is a clear trend in overall forest vulnerability that is driven by a warming-induced reduction in plant defence mechanisms to insect outbreaks, especially at high latitudes. Natural disturbances imperil healthy and productive forests, but quantifying their effects at large scales is challenging. Here the authors apply machine learning to disturbance records and satellite data to quantify and map European forest vulnerability to fires, windthrows, and insect outbreaks through 1979-2018.

J	Hartmann, MJ; Carleo, G				Hartmann, Michael J.; Carleo, Giuseppe			Neural-Network Approach to Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Dynamics	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							RENORMALIZATION-GROUP; SYSTEMS; STATES	In experimentally realistic situations, quantum systems are never perfectly isolated and the coupling to their environment needs to be taken into account. Often, the effect of the environment can be well approximated by a Markovian master equation. However, solving this master equation for quantum many-body systems becomes exceedingly hard due to the high dimension of the Hilbert space. Here we present an approach to the effective simulation of the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems based on machine-learning techniques. We represent the mixed many-body quantum states with neural networks in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines and derive a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for their time evolution and stationary states. We document the accuracy of the approach with numerical examples for a dissipative spin lattice system.

Covalency competition dominates the water oxidation structure-activity relationship on spinel oxides	NATURE CATALYSIS			English	Article							EVOLUTION ACTIVITIES; REACTION-MECHANISM; OXYGEN REDUCTION; RATIONAL DESIGN; LATTICE OXYGEN; METAL-OXIDES; ENERGY; ELECTROCATALYSTS; PERFORMANCE; TRANSITION	Spinel oxides have attracted growing interest over the years for catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, but fundamental understanding of their structure-property relationships remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that the OER activity on spinel oxides is intrinsically dominated by the covalency competition between tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The competition fabricates an asymmetric M-T-O-M(O)backbone where the bond with weaker metal-oxygen covalency determines the exposure of cation sites and therefore the activity. Driven by this finding, a dataset with more than 300 spinel oxides is computed and used to train a machine-learning model for screening the covalency competition in spinel oxides, with a mean absolute error of 0.05 eV. [Mn](T)[Al0.5Mn1.5](O)O(4)is predicted to be a highly active OER catalyst and subsequent experimental results confirm its superior activity. This work sets mechanistic principles of spinel oxides for water oxidation, which may be extendable to other applications.

Through an enormous experimental effort(1-4), the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined(5), but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences(6,7). Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'(8)-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years(9). Despite recent progress(10-14), existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)(15), demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.

NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Three-dimensional displays; Benchmark testing; Cameras; Deep learning; Semantics; Lighting; Skeleton; Activity understanding; video analysis; 3D action recognition; RGB plus D vision; deep learning; large-scale benchmark	ACTION RECOGNITION; ACTIONLET ENSEMBLE; FEATURES	Research on depth-based human activity analysis achieved outstanding performance and demonstrated the effectiveness of 3D representation for action recognition. The existing depth-based and RGB+D-based action recognition benchmarks have a number of limitations, including the lack of large-scale training samples, realistic number of distinct class categories, diversity in camera views, varied environmental conditions, and variety of human subjects. In this work, we introduce a large-scale dataset for RGB+D human action recognition, which is collected from 106 distinct subjects and contains more than 114 thousand video samples and 8 million frames. This dataset contains 120 different action classes including daily, mutual, and health-related activities. We evaluate the performance of a series of existing 3D activity analysis methods on this dataset, and show the advantage of applying deep learning methods for 3D-based human action recognition. Furthermore, we investigate a novel one-shot 3D activity recognition problem on our dataset, and a simple yet effective Action-Part Semantic Relevance-aware (APSR) framework is proposed for this task, which yields promising results for recognition of the novel action classes. We believe the introduction of this large-scale dataset will enable the community to apply, adapt, and develop various data-hungry learning techniques for depth-based and RGB+D-based human activity understanding.

However, due to the fact that in real world industrial applications, the working load is changing all the time and noise from the working environment is inevitable, degradation of the performance of intelligent fault diagnosis methods is very serious. In this paper, a new model based on deep learning is proposed to address the problem. Our contributions of include: First, we proposed an end-to-end method that takes raw temporal signals as inputs and thus doesn't need any time consuming denoising preprocessing. The model can achieve pretty high accuracy under noisy environment. Second, the model does not rely on any domain adaptation algorithm or require information of the target domain. It can achieve high accuracy when working load is changed. To understand the proposed model, we will visualize the learned features, and try to analyze the reasons behind the high performance of the model. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

JHU-CROWD plus plus : Large-Scale Crowd Counting Dataset and A Benchmark Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Annotations; Task analysis; Training; Head; Meteorology; Benchmark testing; Learning systems; Crowd counting; dataset		We introduce a new large scale unconstrained crowd counting dataset (JHU-CROWD++) that contains "4,372" images with "1.51 million" annotations. In comparison to existing datasets, the proposed dataset is collected under a variety of diverse scenarios and environmental conditions. Specifically, the dataset includes several images with weather-based degradations and illumination variations, making it a very challenging dataset. Additionally, the dataset consists of a rich set of annotations at both image-level and head-level. Several recent methods are evaluated and compared on this dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from http://www.crowd-counting.com. Furthermore, we propose a novel crowd counting network that progressively generates crowd density maps via residual error estimation. The proposed method uses VGG16 as the backbone network and employs density map generated by the final layer as a coarse prediction to refine and generate finer density maps in a progressive fashion using residual learning. Additionally, the residual learning is guided by an uncertainty-based confidence weighting mechanism that permits the flow of only high-confidence residuals in the refinement path. The proposed Confidence Guided Deep Residual Counting Network (CG-DRCN) is evaluated on recent complex datasets, and it achieves significant improvements In errors.

High-Dimensional Dense Residual Convolutional Neural Network for Light Field Reconstruction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Image reconstruction; Convolution; Estimation; Image restoration; Feature extraction; Correlation; Light field super-resolution; 4-dimensional convolution; convolutional neural networks; deep learning	CAMERA; RESOLUTION	We consider the problem of high-dimensional light field reconstruction and develop a learning-based framework for spatial and angular super-resolution. Many current approaches either require disparity clues or restore the spatial and angular details separately. Such methods have difficulties with non-Lambertian surfaces or occlusions. In contrast, we formulate light field super-resolution (LFSR) as tensor restoration and develop a learning framework based on a two-stage restoration with 4-dimensional (4D) convolution. This allows our model to learn the features capturing the geometry information encoded in multiple adjacent views. Such geometric features vary near the occlusion regions and indicate the foreground object border. To train a feasible network, we propose a novel normalization operation based on a group of views in the feature maps, design a stage-wise loss function, and develop the multi-range training strategy to further improve the performance. Evaluations are conducted on a number of light field datasets including real-world scenes, synthetic data, and microscope light fields. The proposed method achieves superior performance and less execution time comparing with other state-of-the-art schemes.

Cloud computing has changed the using, storing, and sharing of resources such as data, services, and applications for industrial applications. During the last decade, industries have rapidly switched to cloud computing for having more comprehensive access, reduced cost, and increased performance. In addition, significant improvement has been observed in the internet of things (IoT) with the integration of cloud computing. However, this rapid transition into the cloud raised various security issues and concerns. Traditional security solutions are not directly applicable and sometimes ineffective for cloud-based systems. Cloud platforms' challenges and security concerns have been addressed during the last three years, despite the successive use and proliferation of multifaceted cyber weapons. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain has brought many benefits that can be utilized to address industrial security issues in the cloud. The findings of the proposed research include the following: we present a comprehensive survey of enabling cloud-based IoT architecture, services, configurations, and security models; the classification of cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories (data, network and service, applications, and people-related security issues), which are discussed in detail; we identify and inspect the latest advancements in cloud-based IoT attacks; we identify, discuss, and analyze significant security issues in each category and present the limitations from a general, artificial intelligence and deep learning perspective; we provide the technological challenges identified in the literature and then identify significant research gaps in the IoT-based cloud infrastructure to highlight future research directions to blend cybersecurity in cloud.

Radiomic features capture tissue and lesion characteristics such as heterogeneity and shape and may, alone or in combination with demographic, histologic, genomic, or proteomic data, be used for clinical problem solving. The goal of this continuing education article is to provide an introduction to the field, covering the basic radiomics workflow: feature calculation and selection, dimensionality reduction, and data processing. Potential clinical applications in nuclear medicine that include PET radiomics-based prediction of treatment response and survival will be discussed. Current limitations of radiomics, such as sensitivity to acquisition parameter variations, and common pitfalls will also be covered.

It is currently in the process of bringing back 100,000 of the original participants for brain, heart and body MRI, carotid ultrasound and low-dose bone/fat x-ray. The brain imaging component covers 6 modalities (T1, T2 FLAIR, susceptibility weighted MRI, Resting fMRI, Task fMRI and Diffusion MRI). Raw and processed data from the first 10,000 imaged subjects has recently been released for general research access. To help convert this data into useful summary information we have developed an automated processing and QC (Quality Control) pipeline that is available for use by other researchers. In this paper we describe the pipeline in detail, following a brief overview of UK Biobank brain imaging and the acquisition protocol. We also describe several quantitative investigations carried out as part of the development of both the imaging protocol and the processing pipeline.

To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (t(center), t(context)) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI t(center) and POI t(context). Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-S-WP = 0.356, MRR-S-LC= 0.401, MRR-S-JC = 0.433, and MRR-S-Lin= 0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA= 0.7424).
