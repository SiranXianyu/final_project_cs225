J	Li, PK; Xu, YQ; Wei, YC; Yang, Y				Li, Peike; Xu, Yunqiu; Wei, Yunchao; Yang, Yi			Self-Correction for Human Parsing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Training; Task analysis; Predictive models; Annotations; Semantics; Analytical models; Solid modeling; Human parsing; learning with label noise; fine-grained semantic segmentation; video human parsing		Labeling pixel-level masks for fine-grained semantic segmentation tasks, e.g., human parsing, remains a challenging task. The ambiguous boundary between different semantic parts and those categories with similar appearances are usually confusing for annotators, leading to incorrect labels in ground-truth masks. These label noises will inevitably harm the training process and decrease the performance of the learned models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a noise-tolerant method in this work, called Self-Correction for Human Parsing (SCHP), to progressively promote the reliability of the supervised labels as well as the learned models. In particular, starting from a model trained with inaccurate annotations as initialization, we design a cyclically learning scheduler to infer more reliable pseudo masks by iteratively aggregating the current learned model with the former sub-optimal one in an online manner. Besides, those correspondingly corrected labels can in turn to further boost the model performance. In this way, the models and the labels will reciprocally become more robust and accurate during the self-correction learning cycles. Our SCHP is model-agnostic and can be applied to any human parsing models for further enhancing their performance. Extensive experiments on four human parsing models, including Deeplab V3+, CE2P, OCR and CE2P+, well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCHP. We achieve the new state-of-the-art results on 6 benchmarks, including LIP, Pascal-Person-Part and ATR for single human parsing, CIHP and MHP for multi-person human parsing and VIP for video human parsing tasks. In addition, benefiting the superiority of SCHP, we achieved the 1st place on all the three human parsing tracks in the 3rd Look Into Person Challenge.

An advanced programming technique known as genetic expression programming (GEP) is used in this research for developing an empirical multiphysics model for predicting the compressive strength of RHA incorporated concrete. A vast database comprising of 250 data points is obtained from the extensive and consistent literature review. Different parameters such as age, RHA content, cement content, water content, amount of superplasticizer and aggregate content are used as inputs. A closed-form equation solution was obtained to predict the compressive strength of RHA based on input parameters. The performance of GEP is evaluated by comparing it with regression models. Statistical parameter R-2 is used to assess the results predicted by GEP and regression models. Statistical and parametric analysis is also carried out to determine the influence of inputs on the outcome. The GEP model performed better in all terms as compared to other models.

Here we use machine learning to merge energy flux measurements from FLUXNET eddy covariance towers with remote sensing and meteorological data to estimate global gridded net radiation, latent and sensible heat and their uncertainties. The resulting FLUXCOM database comprises 147 products in two setups: (1) 0.0833 degrees resolution using MODIS remote sensing data (RS) and (2) 0.5 degrees resolution using remote sensing and meteorological data (RS + METEO). Within each setup we use a full factorial design across machine learning methods, forcing datasets and energy balance closure corrections. For RS and RS + METEO setups respectively, we estimate 2001-2013 global (+/- 1s.d.) net radiation as 75.49 +/- 1.39 W m(-2) and 77.52 +/- 2.43 W m(-2), sensible heat as 32.39 +/- 4.17 W m(-2) and 35.58 +/- 4.75 W m(-2), and latent heat flux as 39.14 +/- 6.60 W m(-2) and 39.49 +/- 4.51 W m(-2) (as evapotranspiration, 75.6 +/- 9.8 x 10(3) km(3) yr(-1) and 76 +/- 6.8 x 10(3) km(3) yr(-1)). FLUXCOM products are suitable to quantify global land-atmosphere interactions and benchmark land surface model simulations.

J	Zhang, TN; He, WH; Zheng, H; Cui, YP; Song, HQ; Fu, SL				Zhang, Tianning; He, Weihuan; Zheng, Hui; Cui, Yaoping; Song, Hongquan; Fu, Shenglei			Satellite-based ground PM2.5 estimation using a gradient boosting decision tree	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Aerosol optical depth; Air pollution; Machine learning; MODIS; Particulate matter		Fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is one of the major air pollutants risks to human health worldwide. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are an effective metric for acquiring PM2.5 information, featuring broad coverage and high resolution, which compensate for the sparse and uneven distribution of existing monitoring stations. In this study, a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model for estimating ground PM2.5 concentration directly from AOD products across China in 2017, integrating human activities and various natural variables was proposed. The GBDT model performed well in estimating temporal variability and spatial contrasts in daily PM2.5 concentrations, with relatively high fitted model (10-fold cross-validation) coefficients of determination of 0.98 (0.81), low root mean square errors of 3.82 (11.57) mu g/m(3), and mean absolute error of 1.44 (7.45) mu g/m(3). Seasonal examinations revealed that summer had the cleanest air with the highest estimation accuracies, whereas winter had the most polluted air with the lowest estimation accuracies. The model successfully captured the PM(2.5 )distribution pattern across China in 2017, showing high levels in southwest Xinjiang, the North China Plain, and the Sichuan Basin, especially in winter. Compared with other models, the GBDT model showed the highest performance in the estimation of PM2.5 with a 3-km resolution. This algorithm can be adopted to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 estimation with higher spatial resolution, especially in summer. In general, this study provided a potential method of improving the accuracy of satellite-based ground PM2.5 estimation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, governments, businesses, and individual Internet users show the growing public appetite to improve cyber resilience that refers to their ability to prepare for, combat and recover from cyber threats and incidents. Undoubtedly, predicting cybersecurity incidents is deemed to have excellent potential for proactively advancing cyber resilience. Research communities and industries have begun proposing cybersecurity incident prediction schemes by utilizing different types of data sources, including organization's reports and datasets, network data, synthetic data, data crawled from webpages, and data retrieved from social media. With a focus on the dataset, this survey paper investigates the emerging research by reviewing recent representative works appeared in the dominant period. We also extract and summarize the data-driven research methodology commonly adopted in this fast-growing area. In consonance with the phases of the methodology, each work that predicts cybersecurity incident is comprehensively studied. Challenges and future directions in this field are also discussed.

This study is based on the comparison of algorithms between individuals and ensemble approaches, such as bagging. Optimization for bagging is done by making 20 sub-models to depict the accurate one. Variables like cement content, fine and coarse aggregate, water, binder-to-water ratio, fly-ash, and superplasticizer are used for modeling. Model performance is evaluated by various statistical indicators like mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). Individual algorithms show a moderate bias result. However, the ensemble model gives a better result with R-2 = 0.911 compared to the decision tree (DT) and gene expression programming (GEP). K-fold cross-validation confirms the model's accuracy and is done by R-2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Statistical checks reveal that the decision tree with ensemble provides 25%, 121%, and 49% enhancement for errors like MAE, MSE, and RMSE between the target and outcome response.

One of the stakes linked with cardiovascular diseases and other complications is hypertension. Naturally derived bioactive peptides with antihypertensive activities serve as promising alternatives to pharmaceutical drugs. So far, there is no comprehensive analysis, assessment of diverse features and implementation of various machine-learning (ML) algorithms applied for antihypertensive peptide (AHTP) model construction. Results: In this study, we utilized six different ML algorithms, namely, Adaboost, extremely randomized tree (ERT), gradient boosting (GB), k-nearest neighbor, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) using 51 feature descriptors derived from eight different feature encodings for the prediction of AHTPs. While ERT-based trained models performed consistently better than other algorithms regardless of various feature descriptors, we treated them as baseline predictors, whose predicted probability of AHTPs was further used as input features separately for four different ML-algorithms (ERT, GB, RF and SVM) and developed their corresponding meta-predictors using a two-step feature selection protocol. Subsequently, the integration of four meta-predictors through an ensemble learning approach improved the balanced prediction performance and model robustness on the independent dataset. Upon comparison with existing methods, mAHTPred showed superior performance with an overall improvement of approximately 6-7% in both benchmarking and independent datasets.

Materials and methods PubMed and Embase were searched for studies published in high clinical imaging journals until December 2018 using the terms "radiomics" and "radiogenomics." Studies were scored against the items in the RQS and TRIPOD guidelines. Subgroup analyses were performed for journal type (clinical vs. imaging), intended use (diagnostic vs. prognostic), and imaging modality (CT vs. MRI), and articles were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney analysis. Results Seventy-seven articles were included. The mean RQS score was 26.1% of the maximum (9.4 out of 36). The RQS was low in demonstration of clinical utility (19.5%), test-retest analysis (6.5%), prospective study (3.9%), and open science (3.9%). None of the studies conducted a phantom or cost-effectiveness analysis. The adherence rate for TRIPOD was 57.8% (mean) and was particularly low in reporting title (2.6%), stating study objective in abstract and introduction (7.8% and 16.9%), blind assessment of outcome (14.3%), sample size (6.5%), and missing data (11.7%) categories. Studies in clinical journals scored higher and more frequently adopted external validation than imaging journals. Conclusions The overall scientific quality and reporting of radiomics studies is insufficient. Scientific improvements need to be made to feature reproducibility, analysis of clinical utility, and open science categories. Reporting of study objectives, blind assessment, sample size, and missing data is deemed to be necessary.

Binding of miRNAs to target mRNAs can repress their translation by inducing the degradation or by inhibiting the translation of the target mRNAs. High throughput experimental approaches for miRNA target identification are costly and timeconsuming, depending on various factors. It is vitally important to develop bioinformatics methods for accurately predicting miRNA targets. With the increase of RNA sequences in the post-genomic era, bioinformatics methods are being developed for miRNA studies especially for miRNA target prediction. This review summarizes the current development of state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools for miRNA target prediction, points out the progress and limitations of the available miRNA databases, and their working principles. Finally, we discuss the caveat and perspectives of the next-generation algorithms for the prediction of miRNA targets.

This study innovatively adopts gradient boosting decision trees to fill the gaps. Using data from Oslo, we apply this method to the data on both weekdays and weekends to illustrate the differential effects of built environment characteristics on driving distance. We found that they have a stronger effect on weekdays than on weekends. On weekdays, their collective influence is larger than that of demographics. Furthermore, they show salient non-linear effects on driving distance in both models, challenging the linearity assumption commonly adopted in the literature. This study also identifies effective ranges of distance to different centers and population density, and highlights the important role of sub-centers in driving reduction.

Clinical predictors of acute cardiac injury and normalization of troponin after hospital discharge from COVID-19	EBIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Machine learning; SARS-CoV-2; acute myocardial injury; heart failure	MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; HEART-FAILURE; CORONAVIRUS; WUHAN; ACE2; RISK	Background Although acute cardiac injury (ACI) is a known COVID-19 complication, whether ACI acquired during COVID-19 recovers is unknown. This study investigated the incidence of persistent ACI and identified clinical predictors of ACI recovery in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 2.5 months post-discharge. Methods This retrospective study consisted of 10,696 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from March II, 2020 to June 3, 2021. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory tests were collected at ACI onset, hospital discharge, and 2.5 months post-discharge. ACI was defined as serum troponin-T (TNT) level >99th-percentile upper reference limit (0.014ng/mL) during hospitalization, and recovery was defined as TNT below this threshold 2.5 months post-discharge. Four models were used to predict ACI recovery status. Results There were 4,248 (39.7%) COVID-19 patients with ACI, with most (93%) developed ACI on or within a day after admission. In-hospital mortality odds ratio of ACI patients was 4.45 [95%CI: 3.92, 5.05, p<0.001] compared to non-ACI patients. Of the 2,880 ACI survivors, 1,114 (38.7%) returned to our hospitals 2.5 months on average post-discharge, of which only 302 (44.9%) out of 673 patients recovered from ACI. There were no significant differences in demographics, race, ethnicity, major commodities, and length of hospital stay between groups. Prediction of ACI recovery post-discharge using the top predictors (troponin, creatinine, lymphocyte, sodium, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes and hematocrit) at discharge yielded 63.73%-75.73% accuracy. Interpretation Persistent cardiac injury is common among COVID-19 survivors. Readily available patient data accurately predict ACI recovery post-discharge. Early identification of at-risk patients could help prevent long-term cardiovascular complications. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Bondielli, A; Marcelloni, F				Bondielli, Alessandro; Marcelloni, Francesco			A survey on fake news and rumour detection techniques	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Fake news; Rumours; Natural language processing; Data mining; Text mining; Classification; Machine learning; Deep learning		False or unverified information spreads just like accurate information on the web, thus possibly going viral and influencing the public opinion and its decisions. Fake news and rumours represent the most popular forms of false and unverified information, respectively, and should be detected as soon as possible for avoiding their dramatic effects. The interest in effective detection techniques has been therefore growing very fast in the last years. In this paper we survey the different approaches to automatic detection of fake news and rumours proposed in the recent literature. In particular, we focus on five main aspects. First, we report and discuss the various definitions of fake news and rumours that have been considered in the literature. Second, we highlight how the collection of relevant data for performing fake news and rumours detection is problematic and we present the various approaches, which have been adopted to gather these data, as well as the publicly available datasets. Third, we describe the features that have been considered in fake news and rumour detection approaches. Fourth, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the various techniques used to perform rumour and fake news detection. Finally, we identify and discuss future directions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Given major confounding factors such as age and comorbidities, true mediators of this condition have remained elusive. We used a multi-omics analysis combined with artificial intelligence in a young patient cohort where major comorbidities were excluded at the onset. The cohort included 47 "critical" (in the intensive care unit under mechanical ventilation) and 25 "non-critical" (in a non-critical care ward) patients with COVID-19 and 22 healthy individuals. The analyses included whole-genome sequencing, whole-blood RNA sequencing, plasma and blood mononuclear cell proteomics, cytokine profiling, and high-throughput immunophenotyping. An ensemble of machine learning, deep learning, quantum annealing, and structural causal modeling were used. Patients with critical COVID-19 were characterized by exacerbated inflammation, perturbed lymphoid and myeloid compartments, increased coagulation, and viral cell biology. Among differentially expressed genes, we observed up-regulation of the metalloprotease ADAM9. This gene signature was validated in a second independent cohort of 81 critical and 73 recovered patients with COVID-19 and was further confirmed at the transcriptional and protein level and by proteolytic activity. Ex vivo ADAM9 inhibition decreased severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uptake and replication in human lung epithelial cells. In conclusion, within a young, otherwise healthy, cohort of individuals with COVID-19, we provide the landscape of biological perturbations in vivo where a unique gene signature differentiated critical from non-critical patients. We further identified ADAM9 as a driver of disease severity and a candidate therapeutic target.

J	Priyadarshani, N; Marsland, S; Castro, I				Priyadarshani, Nirosha; Marsland, Stephen; Castro, Isabel			Automated birdsong recognition in complex acoustic environments: a review	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY			English	Review						birdsong recording; passive acoustic monitoring; machine learning; noise; birdsong recognition	INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION; AUDIO-RECORDINGS; SONG; CLASSIFICATION; SOUNDS; CALL; VOCALIZATIONS; SPEECH; TIME; TOOL	Conservationists are increasingly using autonomous acoustic recorders to determine the presence/absence and the abundance of bird species. Unlike humans, these recorders can be left in the field for extensive periods of time in any habitat. Although data acquisition is automated, manual processing of recordings is labour intensive, tedious, and prone to bias due to observer variations. Hence automated birdsong recognition is an efficient alternative. However, only few ecologists and conservationists utilise the existing birdsong recognisers to process unattended field recordings because the software calibration time is exceptionally high and requires considerable knowledge in signal processing and underlying systems, making the tools less user-friendly. Even allowing for these difficulties, getting accurate results is exceedingly hard. In this review we examine the state-of-the-art, summarising and discussing the methods currently available for each of the essential parts of a birdsong recogniser, and also available software. The key reasons behind poor automated recognition are that field recordings are very noisy, calls from birds that are a long way from the recorder can be faint or corrupted, and there are overlapping calls from many different birds. In addition, there can be large numbers of different species calling in one recording, and therefore the method has to scale to large numbers of species, or at least avoid misclassifying another species as one of particular interest. We found that these areas of importance, particularly the question of noise reduction, are amongst the least researched. In cases where accurate recognition of individual species is essential, such as in conservation work, we suggest that specialised (species-specific) methods of passive acoustic monitoring are required. We also believe that it is important that comparable measures, and datasets, are used to enable methods to be compared.

Recombination has important roles in genome diversity and evolution. This review firstly provides a comprehensive survey of the 15 computational methods developed for identifying recombination hotspots in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These computational methods were discussed and compared in terms of underlying algorithms, extracted features, predictive capability and practical utility. Subsequently, a more objective benchmark data set was constructed to develop a new predictor iRSpot-Pse6NC2.0 (http://lin-group.cn/server/iRSpot-Pse6NC2.0). To further demonstrate the generalization ability of these methods, we compared iRSpot-Pse6NC2.0 with existing methods on the chromosome XVI of S. cerevisiae. The results of the independent data set test demonstrated that the new predictor is superior to existing tools in the identification of recombination hotspots. The iRSpot-Pse6NC2.0 will become an important tool for identifying recombination hotspot.

Satellite remote sensing has proven to be an increasingly more reliable tool to identify crop types. With the Copernicus program and its Sentinel satellites, a growing source of satellite remote sensing data is publicly available at no charge. Here, we used joint Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical imagery to create a crop map for Belgium. To ensure homogenous radar and optical inputs across the country, Sentinel-1 12-day backscatter mosaics were created after incidence angle normalization, and Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were smoothed to yield 10-daily cloud-free mosaics. An optimized random forest classifier predicted the eight crop types with a maximum accuracy of 82% and a kappa coefficient of 0.77. We found that a combination of radar and optical imagery always outperformed a classification based on single-sensor inputs, and that classification performance increased throughout the season until July, when differences between crop types were largest. Furthermore, we showed that the concept of classification confidence derived from the random forest classifier provided insight into the reliability of the predicted class for each pixel, clearly showing that parcel borders have a lower classification confidence. We concluded that the synergistic use of radar and optical data for crop classification led to richer information increasing classification accuracies compared to optical-only classification. Further work should focus on object-level classification and crop monitoring to exploit the rich potential of combined radar and optical observations.

Here we present GLORYx, which integrates machine learning-based site of metabolism (SoM) prediction with reaction rule sets to predict and rank the structures of metabolites that could potentially be formed by phase 1 and/or phase 2 metabolism. GLORYx extends the approach from our previously developed tool GLORY, which predicted metabolite structures for cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism only. A robust approach to ranking the predicted metabolites is attained by using the SoM probabilities predicted by the FAME 3 machine learning models to score the predicted metabolites. On a manually curated test data set containing both phase 1 and phase 2 metabolites, GLORYx achieves a recall of 77% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.79. Separate analysis of performance on a large amount of freely available phase 1 and phase 2 metabolite data indicates that achieving a meaningful ranking of predicted metabolites is more difficult for phase 2 than for phase 1 metabolites. GLORYx is freely available as a web server at https://nerdd.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/ and is also provided as a software package upon request. The data sets as well as all the reaction rules from this work are also made freely available.

Kernel-Based Density Map Generation for Dense Object Counting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Crowd counting; vehicle counting; object counting; density map generation; density map estimation; deep learning	PEOPLE	Crowd counting is an essential topic in computer vision due to its practical usage in surveillance systems. The typical design of crowd counting algorithms is divided into two steps. First, the ground-truth density maps of crowd images are generated from the ground-truth dot maps (density map generation), e.g., by convolving with a Gaussian kernel. Second, deep learning models are designed to predict a density map from an input image (density map estimation). The density map based counting methods that incorporate density map as the intermediate representation have improved counting performance dramatically. However, in the sense of end-to-end training, the hand-crafted methods used for generating the density maps may not be optimal for the particular network or dataset used. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive density map generator, which takes the annotation dot map as input, and learns a density map representation for a counter. The counter and generator are trained jointly within an end-to-end framework. We also show that the proposed framework can be applied to general dense object counting tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on 10 datasets for 3 applications: crowd counting, vehicle counting, and general object counting. The experiment results on these datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed learnable density map representations.

Neighborhood is one of the most important concepts in classification learning and can be used to distinguish samples with different decisions. In this paper, a neighborhood discrimination index is proposed to characterize the distinguishing information of a neighborhood relation. It reflects the distinguishing ability of a feature subset. The proposed discrimination index is computed by considering the cardinality of a neighborhood relation rather than neighborhood similarity classes. Variants of the discrimination index, including joint discrimination index, conditional discrimination index, and mutual discrimination index, are introduced to compute the change of distinguishing information caused by the combination of multiple feature subsets. They have the similar properties as Shannon entropy and its variants. A parameter, named neighborhood radius, is introduced in these discrimination measures to address the analysis of real-valued data. Based on the proposed discrimination measures, the significance measure of a candidate feature is defined and a greedy forward algorithm for feature selection is designed. Data sets selected from public data sources are used to compare the proposed algorithm with existing algorithms. The experimental results confirm that the discrimination index-based algorithm yields superior performance compared to other classical algorithms.

This can be seen in the rising number of related works published. This culminated further with the combination of pioneering optimization techniques. Who would have thought that the birds and the bees can offer advances in the mathematical sciences and so have the ants too? The ingenuity of humans is spelled out in the algorithms that mimic many natural activities, like pack hunting by the wolves! This review paper serves to broadcast more of the intriguing interest in newfound procedures in optimal forecasting. Reservoirs are the main and most efficient water storage facilities for managing uneven water distribution. However, due to the major global climate changes which affect rainfall trend and weather, it has been a necessity to find an alternative solution for effective conventional water balance. A multifunctional reservoir operation appears to require the operator to make wise decisions to achieve an optimal reservoir operation. One of the most important aspects of all this is the forecasting of streamflows. For this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to be the best alternative solution; as in the past three decades, there has been a drastic increase in building and developing AI models for forecasting and modelling unstable patterns in various hydrological fields. Nevertheless, AI models are also required to be optimized in tandem to achieve the best result, leading thus to the desirous forming of hybrid models between a standalone AI model and optimization techniques. This comprehensive study categorizes machine learning into three main categories, together with the optimization techniques, and will next explore the various AI model used for different hydrology fields along with the most common optimization techniques. Summarization of findings under every section is provided. Some advantages and disadvantages found through literature reviews are summarized for ease of reference. Finally, future recommendations and overall conclusions drawn from the results of researchers are included. This current review focuses on papers from high-impact factor publications based on 10 years starting from (2009 to 2020). (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

However, the lack of real labeled fault data make the machine learning-based diagnosis methods difficult to carry out. To solve this problem, this article proposes a new fault diagnosis framework called multilabel one-dimensional (1-D) generation adversarial network (ML1-D-GAN). In our method, Auxiliary Classifier GAN is utilized first for real damage data generation. Then the generated and real damage data are both used to train the fault classifier. Experimental results reveal that the generated data is applicable, and ML1-D-GAN improves the diagnosing accuracy for real bearing faults from 95% to 98% when trained with the generated data. The scalability of the learning model is also proven in the experiment.

This paper investigates the application of an ensemble approach based on deep belief networks for short-term traffic flow forecasting. Traffic flow data, collected from the real world, is decomposed into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residue with EEMD (Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition). Then, for each component, the essential feature subset is extracted by the mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection) method considering weather conditions and day properties. Furthermore, each component is trained by DBN (Deep belief networks) and their forecasting results are summed up as the output of the ensemble model at last. Results indicate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over the single DBN and other selected methods.

This paper proposes a deep long short-term memory (DLSTM) network-based RUL prediction method using multiple sensor time series signals. The DLSTM model fuses multi-sensor monitoring signals for accurate RUL prediction, which is able to discover the hidden long-term dependencies among sensor time series signals through deep learning structure. By grid search strategy, the network structure and parameters of the DLSTM are efficiently tuned using an adaptive moment estimation algorithm so as to realize an accurate and robust prediction. Two various turbofan engine datasets are adopted to verify the performance of the DLSTM model. The experimental results demonstrate that the DLSTM model has a competitive performance in comparison with state-of-the-arts reported in literatures and other neural network models. (C) 2019 ISA.

As a new evolution network structure, heterogeneous network (HetNet) has been studied in recent years. Compared with homogeneous networks, HetNets can increase the opportunity in the spatial resource reuse and improve users' quality of service by developing small cells into the coverage of macrocells. Since there is mutual interference among different users and the limited spectrum resource in HetNets, however, efficient resource allocation (RA) algorithms are vitally important to reduce the mutual interference and achieve spectrum sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on RA in HetNets for 5G communications. Specifically, we first introduce the definition and different network scenarios of HetNets. Second, RA models are discussed. Then, we present a classification to analyze current RA algorithms for the existing works. Finally, some challenging issues and future research trends are discussed. Accordingly, we provide two potential structures for 6G communications to solve the RA problems of the next-generation HetNets, such as a learning-based RA structure and a control-based RA structure. The goal of this article is to provide important information on HetNets, which could be used to guide the development of more efficient techniques in this research area.

If the type of membrane protein can be detected, the function of protein can be quickly determined. Many existing computational methods not only use the autocorrelation function on the hydrophobicity index of amino acids, but also consider the evolutionary conservatism information of the primary protein sequences. In this study, we employ Average Blocks (AN/Block), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Pseudo-PSSM (PsePSSM) to extract evolution characteristics from Position-Specific Score Matrix (PSSM). Then, we construct five kernels from above five corresponding feature sets. Finally, we propose a novel Multiple Kernel Support Vector Machine (MKSVM) classifier based on Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to integrate five kernels for identifying membrane proteins. For the performance evaluation, our method is tested on four benchmark datasets of membrane proteins. The comparative results demonstrate that our prediction model achieves the best performance among all existing outstanding approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the avalanche of protein sequence data in the post-genomic era, there is an urgent need to develop automated computational methods to enable fast and accurate identification of novel ACPs within the vast number of candidate proteins and peptides. Results: To address this, we propose a novel predictor named Anti-Cancer peptide Predictor with Feature representation Learning (ACPred-FL) for accurate prediction of ACPs based on sequence information. More specifically, we develop an effective feature representation learning model, with which we can extract and learn a set of informative features from a pool of support vector machine-based models trained using sequence-based feature descriptors. By doing so, the class label information of data samples is fully utilized. To improve the feature representation, we further employ a two-step feature selection technique, resulting in a most informative five-dimensional feature vector for the final peptide representation. Experimental results show that such five features provide the most discriminative power for identifying ACPs than currently available feature descriptors, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed feature representation learning approach. The developed ACPred-FL method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

The embedded multifunctional perception system is urged for better interaction and user experience. To realize such a system, a smart soft robotic manipulator is presented that consists of a triboelectric nanogenerator tactile (T-TENG) and length (L-TENG) sensor, as well as a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) pyroelectric temperature sensor. With the aid of machine learning (ML) for data processing, the fusion of the T-TENG and L-TENG sensors can realize the automatic recognition of the grasped objects with the accuracy of 97.143% for 28 different shapes of objects, while the temperature distribution can also be obtained through the pyroelectric sensor. By leveraging the IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) analytics, a digital-twin-based virtual shop is successfully implemented to provide the users with real-time feedback about the details of the product. In general, by offering a more immersive experience in human-machine interactions, the proposed remote interactive system shows the great potential of being the advanced human-machine interface for the applications of the unmanned working space.

We propose a novel approach to boost the network representation power with a two-stream 2-D CNN architecture. The proposed method extracts simultaneously, the spectral features and local spatial and global spatial features, with two 2-D CNN networks and makes use of channel correlations to identify the most informative features. Moreover, we propose a layer-specific regularization and a smooth normalization fusion scheme to adaptively learn the fusion weights for the spectral-spatial features from the two parallel streams. An important asset of our model is the simultaneous training of the feature extraction, fusion, and classification processes with the same cost function. Experimental results on several hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods in the field.

Ignacio			Neural-Network Quantum States, String-Bond States, and Chiral Topological States	PHYSICAL REVIEW X			English	Article							MATRIX RENORMALIZATION-GROUP; RESONATING-VALENCE-BOND; MANY-BODY PROBLEM	Neural-network quantum states have recently been introduced as an Ansatz for describing the wave function of quantum many-body systems. We show that there are strong connections between neural-network quantum states in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines and some classes of tensor-network states in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that short-range restricted Boltzmann machines are entangled plaquette states, while fully connected restricted Boltzmann machines are string-bond states with a nonlocal geometry and low bond dimension. These results shed light on the underlying architecture of restricted Boltzmann machines and their efficiency at representing many-body quantum states. String-bond states also provide a generic way of enhancing the power of neural-network quantum states and a natural generalization to systems with larger local Hilbert space. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of these different classes of states and present a method to combine them together. This allows us to benefit from both the entanglement structure of tensor networks and the efficiency of neural-network quantum states into a single Ansatz capable of targeting the wave function of strongly correlated systems. While it remains a challenge to describe states with chiral topological order using traditional tensor networks, we show that, because of their nonlocal geometry, neural-network quantum states and their string-bond-state extension can describe a lattice fractional quantum Hall state exactly. In addition, we provide numerical evidence that neural-network quantum states can approximate a chiral spin liquid with better accuracy than entangled plaquette states and local string-bond states. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of neural networks to describe complex quantum wave functions and pave the way towards the use of string-bond states as a tool in more traditional machine-learning applications.

This paper explains the design and philosophy behind PySCF that enables it to meet these twin objectives. With several case studies, we show how users can easily implement their own methods using PySCF as a development environment. We then summarize the capabilities of PySCF for molecular and solid-state simulations. Finally, we describe the growing ecosystem of projects that use PySCF across the domains of quantum chemistry, materials science, machine learning, and quantum information science.

It has become an open stage for discussion, ideology expression, knowledge dissemination, emotions and sentiment sharing. This platform is gaining tremendous attraction and a huge user base from all sections and age groups of society. The matter of concern is that up to what extent the contents that are circulating among all these platforms every second changing the mindset, perceptions and lives of billions of people are verified, authenticated and up to the standards. This paper puts forward a holistic view of how the information is being weaponized to fulfil the malicious motives and forcefully making a biased user perception about a person, event or firm. Further, a taxonomy is provided for the classification of malicious information content at different stages and prevalent technologies to cope up with this issue form origin, propagation, detection and containment stages. We also put forward a research gap and possible future research directions so that the web information content could be more reliable and safer to use for decision making as well as for knowledge sharing.

J	Kirby, S; Tamariz, M				Kirby, Simon; Tamariz, Monica			Cumulative cultural evolution, population structure and the origin of combinatoriality in human language	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						combinatoriality; population dynamics; cultural evolution of language	CASE MORPHOLOGY; EMERGENCE; DUALITY; COMMUNICATION; DEMOGRAPHY	Language is the primary repository and mediator of human collective knowledge. A central question for evolutionary linguistics is the origin of the combinatorial structure of language (sometimes referred to as duality of patterning), one of language's basic design features. Emerging sign languages provide a promising arena to study the emergence of language properties. Many, but not all such sign languages exhibit combinatoriality, which generates testable hypotheses about its source. We hypothesize that combinatoriality is the inevitable result of learning biases in cultural transmission, and that population structure explains differences across languages. We construct an agent-based model with population turnover. Bayesian learning agents with a prior preference for compressible languages (modelling a pressure for language learnability) communicate in pairs under pressure to reduce ambiguity. We include two transmission conditions: agents learn the language either from the oldest agent or from an agent in the middle of their lifespan. Results suggest that (1) combinatoriality emerges during iterated cultural transmission under concurrent pressures for simplicity and expressivity and (2) population dynamics affect the rate of evolution, which is faster when agents learn from other learners than when they learn from old individuals. This may explain its absence in some emerging sign languages. We discuss the consequences of this finding for cultural evolution, highlighting the interplay of population-level, functional and cognitive factors. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.

The wide-scale proliferation of sensors coupled with the implementation of embedded computational intelligence algorithms can help to tackle many of the technical challenges associated with this energy systems integration problem. Nonetheless, barriers still exist, as suitable methods are needed to handle complex networks of actors, often with competing objectives, while determining design and operational decisions for systems across a wide spectrum of features and time-scales. This review looks at the current developments in the smart energy sector, focussing on techniques in the main application areas along with relevant implemented examples, while highlighting some of the key challenges currently faced and outlining future pathways for the sector. A detailed overview of a framework developed for the EU H2020 funded Sharing Cities project is also provided to illustrate the nature of the design stages encountered and control hierarchies required. The study aims to summarise the current state of computational intelligence in the field of smart energy management, providing insight into the ways in which current barriers can be overcome.

Furthermore, previous studies often assume that they have linear relationships with walking distance. Using the 2016 Transit On Board Survey in the Minneapolis and St. Paul Metropolitan Area, this study adopted the gradient boosting decision trees method to examine the relationships between walking distance and spatial attributes. Results showed that spatial attributes collectively have larger predictive power than other factors. Moreover, they tend to have non-linear associations with walking distance. We further identified the most effective ranges of spatial attributes to guide stop area planning and stop location choice in the region.

J	Xie, T; Grossman, JC				Xie, Tian; Grossman, Jeffrey C.			Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for an Accurate and Interpretable Prediction of Material Properties	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTORS	The use of machine learning methods for accelerating the design of crystalline materials usually requires manually constructed feature vectors or complex transformation of atom coordinates to input the crystal structure, which either constrains the model to certain crystal types or makes it difficult to provide chemical insights. Here, we develop a crystal graph convolutional neural networks framework to directly learn material properties from the connection of atoms in the crystal, providing a universal and interpretable representation of crystalline materials. Our method provides a highly accurate prediction of density functional theory calculated properties for eight different properties of crystals with various structure types and compositions after being trained with 104 data points. Further, our framework is interpretable because one can extract the contributions from local chemical environments to global properties. Using an example of perovskites, we show how this information can be utilized to discover empirical rules for materials design.

Multi-region sequencing allows the temporal order of some genomic changes in a tumor to be inferred, but the robust identification of repeated evolution across patients remains a challenge. We developed a machine-learning method based on transfer learning that allowed us to overcome the stochastic effects of cancer evolution and noise in data and identified hidden evolutionary patterns in cancer cohorts. When applied to multi-region sequencing datasets from lung, breast, renal, and colorectal cancer (768 samples from 178 patients), our method detected repeated evolutionary trajectories in subgroups of patients, which were reproduced in single-sample cohorts (n = 2,935). Our method provides a means of classifying patients on the basis of how their tumor evolved, with implications for the anticipation of disease progression.

LAMMPS-a flexible simulation tool for particle-based materials modeling at the atomic, meso, and continuum scales	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Molecular dynamics; Materials modeling; Parallel algorithms; LAMMPS	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; REACTIVE FORCE-FIELD; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; COARSE-GRAINED MODEL; ELECTRONEGATIVITY EQUALIZATION; SPIN DYNAMICS; EWALD SUMS; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; ALGORITHM	Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Stormer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code. References [1] S.

J	Jagtap, AD; Kharazmi, E; Karniadakis, GE				Jagtap, Ameya D.; Kharazmi, Ehsan; Karniadakis, George Em			Conservative physics-informed neural networks on discrete domains for conservation laws: Applications to forward and inverse problems	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						cPINN; Mortar PINN; Domain decomposition; Machine learning; Conservation laws; Inverse problems	EQUATIONS	We propose a conservative physics-informed neural network (cPINN) on discrete domains for nonlinear conservation laws. Here, the term discrete domain represents the discrete sub-domains obtained after division of the computational domain, where PINN is applied and the conservation property of cPINN is obtained by enforcing the flux continuity in the strong form along the sub-domain interfaces. In case of hyperbolic conservation laws, the convective flux contributes at the interfaces, whereas in case of viscous conservation laws, both convective and diffusive fluxes contribute. Apart from the flux continuity condition, an average solution (given by two different neural networks) is also enforced at the common interface between two sub-domains. One can also employ a deep neural network in the domain, where the solution may have complex structure, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in the sub-domains with relatively simple and smooth solutions. Another advantage of the proposed method is the additional freedom it gives in terms of the choice of optimization algorithm and the various training parameters like residual points, activation function, width and depth of the network etc. Various forms of errors involved in cPINN such as optimization, generalization and approximation errors and their sources are discussed briefly. In cPINN, locally adaptive activation functions are used, hence training the model faster compared to its fixed counterparts. Both, forward and inverse problems are solved using the proposed method. Various test cases ranging from scalar nonlinear conservation laws like Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations to systems of conservation laws, like compressible Euler equations are solved. The lid-driven cavity test case governed by incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is also solved and the results are compared against a benchmark solution. The proposed method enjoys the property of domain decomposition with separate neural networks in each sub-domain, and it efficiently lends itself to parallelized computation, where each sub-domain can be assigned to a different computational node.

A review of network-based approaches to drug repositioning	BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS			English	Review						drug repurposing; drug-target interaction; biological networks; network analysis; machine learning	TARGET INTERACTION PREDICTION; LABEL PROPAGATION; SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY; KERNELS; CANCER	Experimental drug development is time-consuming, expensive and limited to a relatively small number of targets. However, recent studies show that repositioning of existing drugs can function more efficiently than de novo experimental drug development to minimize costs and risks. Previous studies have proven that network analysis is a versatile platform for this purpose, as the biological networks are used to model interactions between many different biological concepts. The present study is an attempt to review network-based methods in predicting drug targets for drug repositioning. For each method, the preferred type of data set is described, and their advantages and limitations are discussed. For each method, we seek to provide a brief description, as well as an evaluation based on its performance metrics. We conclude that integrating distinct and complementary data should be used because each type of data set reveals a unique aspect of information about an organism. We also suggest that applying a standard set of evaluation metrics and data sets would be essential in this fast-growing research domain.

The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProtSub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.

Many outstanding studies have reported great results in providing sensible indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural stimulation) control over refractory seizures, some of which achieved high performance. However, to achieve high sensitivity and a low false prediction rate, many of these studies relied on handcraft feature extraction and/or tailored feature extraction, which is performed for each patient independently. This approach, however, is not generalizable, and requires significant modifications for each new patient within a new dataset. In this article, we apply convolutional neural networks to different intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and propose a generalized retrospective and patient-specific seizure prediction method. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 30-s EEG windows to extract information in both the frequency domain and the time domain. The algorithm automatically generates optimized features for each patient to best classify preictal and interictal segments. The method can be applied to any other patient from any dataset without the need for manual feature extraction. The proposed approach achieves sensitivity of 81.4%, 81.2%, and 75% and a false prediction rate of 0.06/h, 0.16/h, and 0.21/h on the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset, and the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge dataset, respectively. Our prediction method is also statistically better than an unspecific random predictor for most of the patients in all three datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reproducibility of radiomics studies in multicentre settings is an important criterion for clinical translation. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to investigate reproducibility of radiomics biomarkers in PET imaging and to obtain quantitative information regarding their sensitivity to variations in various imaging and radiomics-related factors as well as their inherent sensitivity. Additionally, we identify and describe data analysis pitfalls that affect the reproducibility and generalizability of radiomics studies. After a systematic literature search, 42 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and data from 21 were used for the quantitative meta-analysis. Data concerning measurement agreement and reliability were collected for 21 of 38 different factors associated with image acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation and radiomics-specific processing steps. Variations in voxel size, segmentation and several reconstruction parameters strongly affected reproducibility, but the level of evidence remained weak. Based on the meta-analysis, we also assessed inherent sensitivity to variations of 110 PET image biomarkers. SUVmean and SUVmax were found to be reliable, whereas image biomarkers based on the neighbourhood grey tone difference matrix and most biomarkers based on the size zone matrix were found to be highly sensitive to variations, and should be used with care in multicentre settings. Lastly, we identify 11 data analysis pitfalls. These pitfalls concern model validation and information leakage during model development, but also relate to reporting and the software used for data analysis. Avoiding such pitfalls is essential for minimizing bias in the results and to enable reproduction and validation of radiomics studies.

Seeking a deep learning-based solution, we design a neural network that has two branches for attention box prediction (ABP) and aesthetics assessment (AA), respectively. Given the input image, the ABP network predicts an attention bounding box as an initial minimum cropping window, around which a set of cropping candidates are generated with little loss of important information. Then, the AA network is employed to select the final cropping window with the best aesthetic quality among the candidates. The two sub-networks are designed to share the same full-image convolutional feature map, and thus are computationally efficient. By leveraging attention prediction and aesthetics assessment, the cropping model produces high-quality cropping results, even with the limited availability of training data for photo cropping. The experimental results on benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, our approach runs at 5 fps, outperforming most previous solutions.

Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Human Centricity and User Interaction	[Holzinger, Andreas; Mueller, Heimo] Med Univ Graz, Inst Med Informat Stat & Documentat, A-8036 Graz, Austria; [Langs, Georg] Med Univ Vienna, Computat Imaging Res Lab, Dept Biomed Imaging & Image Guided Therapy, Vienna, Austria; [Denk, Helmut; Zatloukal, Kurt; Mueller, Heimo] Med Univ Graz, Inst Pathol, Graz, Austria		Holzinger, A (corresponding author), Med Univ Graz, Inst Med Informat Stat & Documentat, A-8036 Graz, Austria.	andreas.holzinger@medunigraz.at	Holzinger, Andreas/E-9530-2010; Müller, Heimo/GQH-6478-2022	Holzinger, Andreas/0000-0002-6786-5194; Müller, Heimo/0000-0002-9691-4872	FeatureCloud [826078]; Hochschulraum-Infrastrukturmittelfonds; MEFO; Austrian Science Fund FWF [I2714-B31]; EU under H2020 [765148]	FeatureCloud; Hochschulraum-Infrastrukturmittelfonds; MEFO; Austrian Science Fund FWF(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); EU under H2020	FeatureCloud, Grant/Award Number: 826078 H2020 EU Project; Hochschulraum-Infrastrukturmittelfonds; MEFO, Grant/Award Number: MEFO-Graz; This work was partially supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF (I2714-B31) and the EU under H2020 (765148)		85	332	334	52	195	WILEY PERIODICALS, INC	SAN FRANCISCO	ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA	1942-4787	1942-4795		WIRES DATA MIN KNOWL	Wiley Interdiscip.

Here, shallow groundwater nitrate concentrations in the Yinchuan Region in central Yinchuan Plain were modeled during 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 using random forest. Multiple spatial environment factors were taken as predictor variables. The relative importance of these factors was also calculated using the constructed model. Remote sensing and GIS methods were used to compile various environmental factors to generate training and test sets for training and validation of the random forest model. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-2) between the observed and predicted groundwater nitrate concentrations were used to measure the model performance. As indicated by these metrics, the random forest model for groundwater nitrate prediction was performed well. The relative importance of the predictor variables computed by the model indicated groundwater nitrate was mainly affected by the distance to the Yellow River, meteorological elements (precipitation, evaporation, and mean air temperature), and water level elevation. Additionally, urban and arable land were the two land use/land cover types that mainly influenced groundwater nitrate concentration in the Yinchuan Region, of which urban land was more influential than arable land as a result of intense expansion of urban land from 2000 to 2015. Overall, the current study provides an approach to integrate multiple environmental factors for groundwater quality study and is also significant for sustainable groundwater management in the Yinchuan Region.

Metakaolin is a component extensively employed in recent decades as a means to reduce the requirement for cement in concrete. For the proposed models, six parameters are accounted for as input data. These are the age at testing, the metakaolin percentage in relation to the total binder, the water-to-binder ratio, the percentage of superplasticizer, the binder to sand ratio and the coarse to fine aggregate ratio. For training and verification of the developed models a database of 867 experimental specimens has been compiled, following a broad survey of the relevant published literature. A robust evaluation process has been utilized for the selection of the optimum model, which manages to estimate the concrete compressive strength, accounting for metakaolin usage, with remarkable accuracy. Using the developed model, a number of diagrams is produced that reveal the highly non-linear influence of mix components to the resulting concrete compressive strength.

Visual assessment by human raters is time-consuming, expensive, and error prone. Disease rating and plant protection need new and innovative techniques to address forthcoming challenges and trends in agricultural production that require more precision than ever before. Within this context, hyperspectral sensors and imaging techniques-intrinsically tied to efficient data analysis approaches-have shown an enormous potential to provide new insights into plant-pathogen interactions and for the detection of plant diseases. This article provides an overview of hyperspectral sensors and imaging technologies for assessing compatible and incompatible plant-pathogen interactions. Within the progress of digital technologies, the vision, which is increasingly discussed in the society and industry, includes smart and intuitive solutions for assessing plant features in plant phenotyping or for making decisions on plant protection measures in the context of precision agriculture.

To be specific, this paper uncovers IJCHM's latent topics and hidden patterns in published research and highlights the differences across three decades and before and after Social Sciences Citation indexing. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 1,573 documents published over 199 issues of IJCHM were analyzed using two computational tools, i.e. metaknowledge and structural topic modeling (STM), as the basis of the mixed method. STM was used to discover the evolution of topics over time. Moreover, bibliometrics (and network analysis) were used to highlight IJCHM's top researchers, top-cited references, the geographical networks of the researchers and differences in the collaborative networks. Findings - The number of papers published continually increased over time with changes of key researchers publishing in IJCHM. The co-authorship networks have also changed and revealed an increasing diversity of authorship and collaborations among authors in different countries. Moreover, the variety of topics and the relative weight of each topic have also changed. Research limitations/implications - Based on the findings of this study, theoretical and practical implications for hospitality and tourism researchers are provided. Originality/value - It is the first attempt to apply topic modeling to a leading academic journal in hospitality and tourism and explore the diversity in contemporary hospitality management research (topics and contributors) from 30 years of published research.

DARPA's Explainable Artificial Intelligence Program	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article							EXPLANATION	Dramatic success in machine learning has led to a new wave of AI applications (for example, transportation, security, medicine, finance, defense) that offer tremendous benefits but cannot explain their decisions and actions to human users. DARPA's explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) program endeavors to create AI systems whose learned models and decisions can be understood and appropriately trusted by end users. Realizing this goal requires methods for learning more explainable models, designing effective explanation interfaces, and understanding the psychologic requirements for effective explanations. The XAI developer teams are addressing the first two challenges by creating ML techniques and developing principles, strategies, and human-computer interaction techniques for generating effective explanations. Another XAI team is addressing the third challenge by summarizing, extending, and applying psychologic theories of explanation to help the XAI evaluator define a suitable evaluation framework, which the developer teams will use to test their systems. The XAI teams completed the first of this 4-year program in May 2018. In a series of ongoing evaluations, the developer teams are assessing how well their XAM systems' explanations improve user understanding, user trust, and user task performance.

COVID-19-related mobility reduction: heterogenous effects on sleep and physical activity rhythms	SLEEP			English	Article						COVID-19; mobility restrictions; wearables; sleep; rest-activity rhythms; machine learning	SOCIAL JETLAG; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; MENTAL-HEALTH; WORK; EXERCISE; TIME; CONSEQUENCES; VARIABILITY; ACTIGRAPHY; DURATION	Study Objectives: Mobility restrictions imposed to suppress transmission of COVID-19 can alter physical activity (PA) and sleep patterns that are important for health and well-being. Characterization of response heterogeneity and their underlying associations may assist in stratifying the health impact of the pandemic. Methods: We obtained wearable data covering baseline, incremental mobility restriction, and lockdown periods from 1,824 city-dwelling, working adults aged 21-40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038 days of PA. Distinct rest-activity rhythm (RAR) profiles were identified using k-means clustering, indicating participants' temporal distribution of step counts over the day. Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of days spent in each of these RAR profiles revealed four groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and during the lockdown. Results: Time in bed increased by 20 min during the lockdown without loss of sleep efficiency, while social jetlag measures decreased by 15 min. Resting heart rate declined by similar to 2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 42%. Four groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown. The least active group comprising similar to 51% of the sample, were younger and predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend differences. Conclusion: In the early aftermath of COVID-19 mobility restriction, PA appears to be more severely affected than sleep. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of responses to lockdown that could associate with different outcomes should the resolution of COVID-19 be protracted.

This field of research, broadly known as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling, has developed many important algorithms and has found a broad range of applications in physical organic and medicinal chemistry in the past 55+ years. This Perspective summarizes recent technological advances in QSAR modeling but it also highlights the applicability of algorithms, modeling methods, and validation practices developed in QSAR to a wide range of research areas outside of traditional QSAR boundaries including synthesis planning, nanotechnology, materials science, biomaterials, and clinical informatics. As modern research methods generate rapidly increasing amounts of data, the knowledge of robust data-driven modelling methods professed within the QSAR field can become essential for scientists working both within and outside of chemical research.

The key ingredient to the problem is how to exploit the temporal correlations of the MR sequence to resolve aliasing artifacts. Traditionally, such observation led to a formulation of an optimization problem, which was solved using iterative algorithms. Recently, however, deep learning-based approaches have gained significant popularity due to their ability to solve general inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a unique, novel convolutional recurrent neural network architecture which reconstructs high quality cardiac MR images from highly undersampled k-space data by jointly exploiting the dependencies of the temporal sequences as well as the iterative nature of the traditional optimization algorithms. In particular, the proposed architecture embeds the structure of the traditional iterative algorithms, efficiently modeling the recurrence of the iterative reconstruction stages by using recurrent hidden connections over such iterations. In addition, spatio-temporal dependencies are simultaneously learnt by exploiting bidirectional recurrent hidden connections across time sequences. The proposed method is able to learn both the temporal dependence and the iterative reconstruction process effectively with only a very small number of parameters, while outperforming current MR reconstruction methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and speed.

Many publications regarding these topics have been published, but they are primarily focused on larger enterprises. However, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered the economic backbone of many countries, which is why it is increasingly important that these kinds of companies also have easy access to these technologies and can make them operational. This paper presents a comprehensive survey and investigation of how widespread AI and IoT are among manufacturing SMEs, and discusses the current limitations and opportunities towards enabling predictive analytics. Firstly, an overview of the enablers for AI and IoT is provided along with the four analytics capabilities. Hereafter a comprehensive literature review is conducted and its findings showcased. Finally, emerging topics of research and development, making AI and IoT accessible technologies to SMEs, and the associated future trends and challenges are summarised.

Accurate 4mC site identification is fundamental to improve the understanding of 4mC biological functions and mechanisms. Hence, it is necessary to develop in silico approaches for efficient and high-throughput 4mC site identification. Although some bioinformatic tools have been developed in this regard, their prediction accuracy and generalizability require improvement to optimize their usability in practical applications. For this purpose, we here proposed Meta-4mCpred, a meta-predictor for 4mC site prediction. In Meta-4mCpred, we employed a feature representation learning scheme and generated 56 probabilistic features based on four different machine-learning algorithms and seven feature encodings covering diverse sequence information, including compositional, physicochemical, and position-specific information. Subsequently, the probabilistic features were used as an input to support vector machine and developed a final meta-predictor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-predictor for 4mC site prediction. Cross-validation results show that Meta-4mCpred achieved an overall average accuracy of 84.2% from six different species, which is similar to 2%-4% higher than those attainable using the state-of-the-art predictors. Furthermore, Meta-4mCpred achieved an overall average accuracy of 86% on independent datasets evaluation, which is over 4% higher than those yielded by the state-of-the-art predictors. The userfriendly webserver employed to implement the proposed Meta-4mCpred is freely accessible at http://thegleelab.org/Meta-4mCpred.

Its failure will lead to severe loss to personnel safety and the stability of the equipment system. It is a long way to investigate the relevant fault diagnosis method, especially the intelligent fault diagnosis method on the basis of deep learning. In consideration of the limitations of traditional fault diagnosis approaches based on shallow layer network structure, the methods based on deep neural network (DNN) are worthy of thorough exploration. As a common DNN with special structure, deep convolutional neural network is of great concern in intelligent fault diagnosis due to its advantages in processing nonlinear problems. This review will play an emphasis on convolutional neural network (CNN). The basic structure and principle are introduced. The applications of CNN-based fault diagnosis method in rotating machinery are summarized and analyzed. Furthermore, the diagnosis performance and potential mechanism from different CNN methods are discussed. In the end, this review is highlighted on the challenges and the potential key points in research on novel intelligent fault diagnosis strategies. The corresponding analysis and discussion will provide some references and lay the foundation for the investigation in related fields.

This paper presents an approach to multi-view subspace clustering that learns a joint subspace representation by constructing affinity matrix shared among all views. Relying on the importance of both low-rank and sparsity constraints in the construction of the affinity matrix, we introduce the objective that balances between the agreement across different views, while at the same time encourages sparsity and low-rankness of the solution. Related low-rank and sparsity constrained optimization problem, is for each view solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Furthermore, we extend our approach to cluster data drawn from nonlinear subspaces by solving the corresponding problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art niulti-view subspace clustering algorithms on one synthetic and four real-world datasets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While the experimental advancement toward realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e., qubits that are not error corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations within a limited coherence time. In the search for achieving quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. The overarching goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks.

Artificial intelligence (AI) advances could be used to increase mammography screening accuracy by reducing missed cancers and false positives. Objective To evaluate whether AI can overcome human mammography interpretation limitations with a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Design, Setting, and Participants In this diagnostic accuracy study conducted between September 2016 and November 2017, an international, crowdsourced challenge was hosted to foster AI algorithm development focused on interpreting screening mammography. More than 1100 participants comprising 126 teams from 44 countries participated. Analysis began November 18, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measurements Algorithms used images alone (challenge 1) or combined images, previous examinations (if available), and clinical and demographic risk factor data (challenge 2) and output a score that translated to cancer yes/no within 12 months. Algorithm accuracy for breast cancer detection was evaluated using area under the curve and algorithm specificity compared with radiologists' specificity with radiologists' sensitivity set at 85.9% (United States) and 83.9% (Sweden). An ensemble method aggregating top-performing AI algorithms and radiologists' recall assessment was developed and evaluated. Results Overall, 144 & x202f;231 screening mammograms from 85 & x202f;580 US women (952 cancer positive <= 12 months from screening) were used for algorithm training and validation. A second independent validation cohort included 166 & x202f;578 examinations from 68 & x202f;008 Swedish women (780 cancer positive). The top-performing algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.858 (United States) and 0.903 (Sweden) and 66.2% (United States) and 81.2% (Sweden) specificity at the radiologists' sensitivity, lower than community-practice radiologists' specificity of 90.5% (United States) and 98.5% (Sweden). Combining top-performing algorithms and US radiologist assessments resulted in a higher area under the curve of 0.942 and achieved a significantly improved specificity (92.0%) at the same sensitivity. Conclusions and Relevance While no single AI algorithm outperformed radiologists, an ensemble of AI algorithms combined with radiologist assessment in a single-reader screening environment improved overall accuracy. This study underscores the potential of using machine learning methods for enhancing mammography screening interpretation. Question How do deep learning algorithms perform compared with radiologists in screening mammography interpretation? Findings In this diagnostic accuracy study using 144 & x202f;231 screening mammograms from 85 & x202f;580 women from the United States and 166 & x202f;578 screening mammograms from 68 & x202f;008 women from Sweden, no single artificial intelligence algorithm outperformed US community radiologist benchmarks; including clinical data and prior mammograms did not improve artificial intelligence performance. However, combining best-performing artificial intelligence algorithms with single-radiologist assessment demonstrated increased specificity. Meaning Integrating artificial intelligence to mammography interpretation in single-radiologist settings could yield significant performance improvements, with the potential to reduce health care system expenditures and address resource scarcity experienced in population-based screening programs. This diagnostic accuracy study evaluates whether artificial intelligence can overcome human mammography interpretation limits with a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of machine learning algorithms.

However, existing MKC algorithms cannot efficiently address the situation where some rows and columns of base kernel matrices are absent. This paper proposes two simple yet effective algorithms to address this issue. Different from existing approaches where incomplete kernel matrices are first imputed and a standard MKC algorithm is applied to the imputed kernel matrices, our first algorithm integrates imputation and clustering into a unified learning procedure. Specifically, we perform multiple kernel clustering directly with the presence of incomplete kernel matrices, which are treated as auxiliary variables to be jointly optimized. Our algorithm does not require that there be at least one complete base kernel matrix over all the samples. Also, it adaptively imputes incomplete kernel matrices and combines them to best serve clustering. Moreover, we further improve this algorithm by encouraging these incomplete kernel matrices to mutually complete each other. The three-step iterative algorithm is designed to solve the resultant optimization problems. After that, we theoretically study the generalization bound of the proposed algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted on 13 benchmark data sets to compare the proposed algorithms with existing imputation-based methods. Our algorithms consistently achieve superior performance and the improvement becomes more significant with increasing missing ratio, verifying the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed joint imputation and clustering.

Intelligent Time-Adaptive Transient Stability Assessment System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article						Long short-term memory; phasor measurement units; recurrent neural network; transient stability assessment; voltage phasor	PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK	Online identification of postcontingency transient stability is essential in power system control, as it facilitates the grid operator to decide and coordinate system failure correction control actions. Utilizing machine learning methods with synchrophasor measurements for transient stability assessment has received much attention recently with the gradual deployment of wide-area protection and control systems. In this paper, we develop a transient stability assessment system based on the long short-term memory network. By proposing a temporal self-adaptive scheme, our proposed system aims to balance the trade-off between assessment accuracy and response time, both of which may be crucial in real-world scenarios. Compared with previous work, the most significant enhancement is that our system learns from the temporal data dependencies of the input data, which contributes to better assessment accuracy. In addition, the model structure of our system is relatively less complex, speeding up the model training process. Case studies on three power systems demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed transient stability as sessment system.	[Yu, James J. Q.; Hill, David J.; Lam, Albert Y. S.; Gu, Jiatao; Li, Victor O.

One of the major abiotic stresses, salinity, causes complex changes in plants by influencing the interactions of genes. The modulated genetic regulation perturbs metabolic balance, which may alter plant's physiology and eventually causing yield losses. To improve agricultural output, researchers have concentrated on identification, characterization and selection of salt tolerant varieties and genotypes, although, most of these varieties are less adopted for commercial production. Nowadays, phenotyping plants through Machine learning (deep learning) approaches that analyze the images of plant leaves to predict biotic and abiotic damage on plant leaves have increased. Here, we review salinity stress related markers on molecular, physiological and morphological levels for crops such as maize, rice, ryegrass, tomato, salicornia, wheat and model plant, Arabidopsis. The combined analysis of data from stress markers on different levels together with image data are important for understanding the impact of salt stress on plants.

However, data movement is costly in terms of time and energy and this problem is aggravated by the recent explosive growth in highly data-centric applications related to artificial intelligence. This calls for a radical departure from the traditional systems and one such non-von Neumann computational approach is in-memory computing. Hereby certain computational tasks are performed in place in the memory itself by exploiting the physical attributes of the memory devices. Both charge-based and resistance-based memory devices are being explored for in-memory computing. In this Review, we provide a broad overview of the key computational primitives enabled by these memory devices as well as their applications spanning scientific computing, signal processing, optimization, machine learning, deep learning and stochastic computing. This Review provides an overview of memory devices and the key computational primitives for in-memory computing, and examines the possibilities of applying this computing approach to a wide range of applications.

However, managing species-rich communities of plant-associated microbiomes remains a major challenge. Here, we propose interdisciplinary research strategies to optimize microbiome functions in agroecosystems. Informatics now allows us to identify members and characteristics of 'core microbiomes', which may be deployed to organize otherwise uncontrollable dynamics of resident microbiomes. Integration of microfluidics, robotics and machine learning provides novel ways to capitalize on core microbiomes for increasing resource-efficiency and stress-resistance of agroecosystems.

J	Dressel, J; Farid, H				Dressel, Julia; Farid, Hany			The accuracy, fairness, and limits of predicting recidivism	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							METAANALYSIS	Algorithms for predicting recidivism are commonly used to assess a criminal defendant's likelihood of committing a crime. These predictions are used in pretrial, parole, and sentencing decisions. Proponents of these systems argue that big data and advanced machine learning make these analyses more accurate and less biased than humans. We show, however, that the widely used commercial risk assessment software COMPAS is no more accurate or fair than predictions made by people with little or no criminal justice expertise. We further show that a simple linear predictor provided with only two features is nearly equivalent to COMPAS with its 137 features.

Robert			Three genetic-environmental networks for human personality	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; EPISODIC MEMORY; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; REGULATORY NETWORK; BASAL GANGLIA; HEALTHY TWIN; TEMPERAMENT; MODEL; DISSOCIATION	Phylogenetic, developmental, and brain-imaging studies suggest that human personality is the integrated expression of three major systems of learning and memory that regulate (1) associative conditioning, (2) intentionality, and (3) self-awareness. We have uncovered largely disjoint sets of genes regulating these dissociable learning processes in different clusters of people with (1) unregulated temperament profiles (i.e., associatively conditioned habits and emotional reactivity), (2) organized character profiles (i.e., intentional self-control of emotional conflicts and goals), and (3) creative character profiles (i.e., self-aware appraisal of values and theories), respectively. However, little is known about how these temperament and character components of personality are jointly organized and develop in an integrated manner. In three large independent genome-wide association studies from Finland, Germany, and Korea, we used a data-driven machine learning method to uncover joint phenotypic networks of temperament and character and also the genetic networks with which they are associated. We found three clusters of similar numbers of people with distinct combinations of temperament and character profiles. Their associated genetic and environmental networks were largely disjoint, and differentially related to distinct forms of learning and memory. Of the 972 genes that mapped to the three phenotypic networks, 72% were unique to a single network. The findings in the Finnish discovery sample were blindly and independently replicated in samples of Germans and Koreans. We conclude that temperament and character are integrated within three disjoint networks that regulate healthy longevity and dissociable systems of learning and memory by nearly disjoint sets of genetic and environmental influences.

Accordingly, in the proposed method, multivariate time series data which include hourly load data, hourly temperature time series and fuzzified version of load time series, was converted into multi-channel images to be fed to a proposed deep learning CNN model with proper architecture. By using images which have been created from the sequenced values of multivariate time series, the proposed CNN model could determine and extract related important parameters, in an implicit and automatic way, without any need for human interaction and expert knowledge, and all by itself. By following this strategy, it was shown how employing the proposed method is easier than some traditional STLF models. Therefore it could be seen as one of the big difference between the proposed method and some state-of-the-art methodologies of STLF. Moreover, using fuzzy logic had great contribution to control over-fitting by expressing one dimension of time series by a fuzzy space, in a spectrum, and a shadow instead of presenting it with exact numbers.

J	Zheng, JD; Pan, HY; Tong, JY; Liu, QY				Zheng, Jinde; Pan, Haiyang; Tong, Jinyu; Liu, Qingyun			Generalized refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy and multi-cluster feature selection based intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearing	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Rolling bearing; Fault diagnosis; Complexity; Generalized refined composite multiscale; entropy; Multiscale fuzzy entropy	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; VECTOR MACHINE; TIME-SERIES; COMPLEXITY; TOOL	Extracting the failure related information from vibration signals is a very important aspect of vibrationbased fault detection for rolling bearing Multiscale entropy and its improvement, multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE), are significant complexity measure tools of time series. They have been successfully applied to extract vibration failure features for rolling bearing condition monitoring . However, MFE over different scales will fluctuate with increase of scale factor. A new nonlinear dynamic parameter termed generalized refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy (GRCMFE) is firstly developed to enhance the performance of MSE and MFE in data complexity measurement. Then three algorithms are developed and compared with MSE and MFE, as well as two algorithms of generalized MFE to verify the availability and superiority by analyzing two kinds of noise signals. In addition, based on three algorithms of GRCMFE, a novel fault diagnosis approach for rolling bearing is proposed with linking multi-cluster feature selection for supervised learning and the gravitational search algorithm optimized support vector machine for failure pattern recognition. Last, the proposed fault diagnostic approach was utilized to analyze two kinds of bearing test data sets. Analysis results indicate that our proposed fault diagnosis approach could effectively extract nonlinear dynamic complexity information and gets the highest identifying rate and the best performance among the comparative approaches.

Deep physical neural networks trained with backpropagation	NATURE			English	Article								Deep-learning models have become pervasive tools in science and engineering. However, their energy requirements now increasingly limit their scalability(1). Deep-learning accelerators(2-9) aim to perform deep learning energy-efficiently, usually targeting the inference phase and often by exploiting physical substrates beyond conventional electronics. Approaches so far(10-22) have been unable to apply the backpropagation algorithm to train unconventional novel hardware in situ. The advantages of backpropagation have made it the de facto training method for large-scale neural networks, so this deficiency constitutes a major impediment. Here we introduce a hybrid in situ-in silico algorithm, called physics-aware training, that applies backpropagation to train controllable physical systems. Just as deep learning realizes computations with deep neural networks made from layers of mathematical functions, our approach allows us to train deep physical neural networks made from layers of controllable physical systems, even when the physical layers lack any mathematical isomorphism to conventional artificial neural network layers. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, we train diverse physical neural networks based on optics, mechanics and electronics to experimentally perform audio and image classification tasks. Physics-aware training combines the scalability of backpropagation with the automatic mitigation of imperfections and noise achievable with in situ algorithms. Physical neural networks have the potential to perform machine learning faster and more energy-efficiently than conventional electronic processors and, more broadly, can endow physical systems with automatically designed physical functionalities, for example, for robotics(23-26), materials(27-29) and smart sensors(30-32).

The aim of this systematic review was to identify the development of AI applications that are widely employed in dentistry and evaluate their performance in terms of diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and predicting the prognosis of the treatment. Materials and methods: The literature for this paper was identified and selected by perform-ing a thorough search in the electronic data bases like PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google scholar, Scopus, Web of science, and Saudi digital library published over the past two decades (January 2000eMarch 15, 2020).After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 43 articles were read in full and critically analyzed. Quality analysis was performed using QUA-DAS-2. Results: AI technologies are widely implemented in a wide range of dentistry specialties. Most of the documented work is focused on AI models that rely on convolutional neural net-works (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). These AI models have been used in detec-tion and diagnosis of dental caries, vertical root fractures, apical lesions, salivary gland diseases, maxillary sinusitis, maxillofacial cysts, cervical lymph nodes metastasis, osteopo-rosis, cancerous lesions, alveolar bone loss, predicting orthodontic extractions, need for or-thodontic treatments, cephalometric analysis, age and gender determination. Conclusion: These studies indicate that the performance of an AI based automated system is excellent. They mimic the precision and accuracy of trained specialists, in some studies it was found that these systems were even able to outmatch dental specialists in terms of per-formance and accuracy.

To address it, many efforts have been made on training sophisticated models with few labeled data in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion. In this paper, we will review the recent progresses on these two major categories of methods. A wide spectrum of models will be categorized in a big picture, where we will show how they interplay with each other to motivate explorations of new ideas. We will review the principles of learning the transformation equivariant, disentangled, self-supervised and semi-supervised representations, all of which underpin the foundation of recent progresses. Many implementations of unsupervised and semi-supervised generative models have been developed on the basis of these criteria, greatly expanding the territory of existing autoencoders, generative adversarial nets (GANs) and other deep networks by exploring the distribution of unlabeled data for more powerful representations. We will discuss emerging topics by revealing the intrinsic connections between unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, and propose in future directions to bridge the algorithmic and theoretical gap between transformation equivariance for unsupervised learning and supervised invariance for supervised learning, and unify unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning. We will also provide a broader outlook of future directions to unify transformation and instance equivariances for representation learning, connect unsupervised and semi-supervised augmentations, and explore the role of the self-supervised regularization for many learning problems.

Few-shot segmentation is thus proposed to tackle this problem by learning a model that quickly adapts to new classes with a few labeled support samples. Theses frameworks still face the challenge of generalization ability reduction on unseen classes due to inappropriate use of high-level semantic information of training classes and spatial inconsistency between query and support targets. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Prior Guided Feature Enrichment Network (PFENet). It consists of novel designs of (1) a training-free prior mask generation method that not only retains generalization power but also improves model performance and (2) Feature Enrichment Module (FEM) that overcomes spatial inconsistency by adaptively enriching query features with support features and prior masks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5(i) and COCO prove that the proposed prior generation method and FEM both improve the baseline method significantly. Our PFENet also outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without efficiency loss. It is surprising that our model even generalizes to cases without labeled support samples.

Clustering of single omic datasets has proven invaluable for biological and medical research. The decreasing cost and development of additional high throughput methods now enable measurement of multi-omic data. Clustering multi-omic data has the potential to reveal further systems-level insights, but raises computational and biological challenges. Here, we review algorithms for multiomics clustering, and discuss key issues in applying these algorithms. Our review covers methods developed specifically for omic data as well as generic multi-view methods developed in the machine learning community for joint clustering of multiple data types. In addition, using cancer data from TCGA, we perform an extensive benchmark spanning ten different cancer types, providing the first systematic comparison of leading multi-omics and multi-view clustering algorithms. The results highlight key issues regarding the use of single-versus multi-omics, the choice of clustering strategy, the power of generic multi-view methods and the use of approximated pvalues for gauging solution quality. Due to the growing use of multi-omics data, we expect these issues to be important for future progress in the field.

J	Shen, HT; Zhu, YH; Zheng, W; Zhu, XF				Shen, Heng Tao; Zhu, Yonghua; Zheng, Wei; Zhu, Xiaofeng			Half-Quadratic Minimization for Unsupervised Feature Selection on Incomplete Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Data models; Minimization; Data analysis; Robustness; Analytical models; Machine learning; Feature selection; half-quadratic minimization; incomplete data; robust statistics; sparse learning		Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is a popular technique of reducing the dimensions of high-dimensional data. Previous UFS methods were often designed with the assumption that the whole information in the data set is observed. However, incomplete data sets that contain unobserved information can be often found in real applications, especially in industry. Thus, these existing UFS methods have a limitation on conducting feature selection on incomplete data. On the other hand, most existing UFS methods did not consider the sample importance for feature selection, i.e., different samples have various importance. As a result, the constructed UFS models easily suffer from the influence of outliers. This article investigates a new UFS method for conducting UFS on incomplete data sets to investigate the abovementioned issues. Specifically, the proposed method deals with unobserved information by using an indicator matrix to filter it out the process of feature selection and reduces the influence of outliers by employing the half-quadratic minimization technique to automatically assigning outliers with small or even zero weights and important samples with large weights. This article further designs an alternative optimization strategy to optimize the proposed objective function as well as theoretically and experimentally prove the convergence of the proposed optimization strategy. Experimental results on both real and synthetic incomplete data sets verified the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with previous methods, in terms of clustering performance on the low-dimensional space of the high-dimensional data.

J	Kobak, D; Berens, P				Kobak, Dmitry; Berens, Philipp			The art of using t-SNE for single-cell transcriptomics	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DIVERSITY; NEURONS	Single-cell transcriptomics yields ever growing data sets containing RNA expression levels for thousands of genes from up to millions of cells. Common data analysis pipelines include a dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.

Objective To develop and validate a machine-learning model based on clinical features for severity risk assessment and triage for COVID-19 patients at hospital admission. Method: 725 patients were used to train and validate the model. This included a retrospective cohort from Wuhan, China of 299 hospitalised COVID-19 patients from 23 December 2019 to 13 February 2020, and five cohorts with 426 patients from eight centres in China, Italy and Belgium from 20 February 2020 to 21 March 2020. The main outcome was the onset of severe or critical illness during hospitalisation. Model performances were quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and metrics derived from the confusion matrix. Results: In the retrospective cohort, the median age was 50 years and 137 (45.8%) were male. In the five test cohorts, the median age was 62 years and 236 (55.4%) were male. The model was prospectively validated on five cohorts yielding AUCs ranging from 0.84 to 0.93, with accuracies ranging from 74.4% to 87.5%, sensitivities ranging from 75.0% to 96.9%, and specificities ranging from 55.0% to 88.0%, most of which performed better than the pneumonia severity index. The cut-off values of the low-, medium- and high-risk probabilities were 0.21 and 0.80. The online calculators can be found at www.covid19risk.ai. Conclusion: The machine-learning model, nomogram and online calculator might be useful to access the onset of severe and critical illness among COVID-19 patients and triage at hospital admission.

We aimed to develop and validate a combined intratumoural and peritumoural radiomics model based on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for preoperative prediction of MVI in primary HCC patients. Methods This study included a training cohort of 110 HCC patients and a validating cohort of 50 HCC patients. All the patients underwent preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI examination and curative hepatectomy. The volumes of interest (VOIs) around the hepatic lesions including intratumoural and peritumoural regions were manually delineated in the hepatobiliary phase of MRI images, from which quantitative features were extracted and analysed. In the training cohort, machine-learning method was applied for dimensionality reduction and selection of the extracted features. Results The proportion of MVI-positive patients was 38.2% and 40.0% in the training and validation cohort, respectively. Supervised machine learning selected ten features to establish a predictive model for MVI. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity of the combined intratumoural and peritumoural radiomics model in the training and validation cohort were 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.93), 88.2%, 76.2%, and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71-0.95), 90.0%, 75.0%, respectively. Conclusions We evaluate quantitative Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI image features of both intratumoural and peritumoural regions and provide an effective radiomics-based model for the prediction of MVI in HCC patients, and may therefore help clinicians make precise decisions regarding treatment before the surgery.

The machine learning methods with signal processing algorithms have been used for automated diagnosis of cardiac health using ECG signals. In this article, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coupled with novel 1-dimensional hexadecimal local pattern (1D-HLP) technique are employed for automated detection of arrhythmia detection. The ECG signals of 10 s duration are subjected to DWT to decompose up to five levels. The 1D-HLP extracts 512 dimensional features from each level of the five levels of low pass filter. Then, these extracted features are concatenated to obtain 512 x 6 = 3072 dimensional feature set. These fused features are subjected to neighborhood component analysis (NCA) feature reduction technique to obtain 64, 128 and 256 features. Finally, these features are subjected to 1 nearest neighborhood (1NN) classifier for classification with 4 distance metrics namely city block, Euclidean, spearman and cosine. We have obtained a classification accuracy of 95.0% in classifying 17 arrhythmia classes using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia ECG dataset. Our results show that the proposed method is more superior than other already reported classical ensemble learning and deep learning methods for arrhythmia detection using ECG signals.

Radiologic screening of high-risk adults reduces lung-cancer-related mortality(1,2); however, a small minority of eligible individuals undergo such screening in the United States(3,4). The availability of blood-based tests could increase screening uptake. Here we introduce improvements to cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq)(5), a method for the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), to better facilitate screening applications. We show that, although levels are very low in early-stage lung cancers, ctDNA is present prior to treatment in most patients and its presence is strongly prognostic. We also find that the majority of somatic mutations in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with lung cancer and of risk-matched controls reflect clonal haematopoiesis and are non-recurrent. Compared with tumour-derived mutations, clonal haematopoiesis mutations occur on longer cfDNA fragments and lack mutational signatures that are associated with tobacco smoking. Integrating these findings with other molecular features, we develop and prospectively validate a machine-learning method termed 'lung cancer likelihood in plasma' (Lung-CLiP), which can robustly discriminate early-stage lung cancer patients from risk-matched controls. This approach achieves performance similar to that of tumour-informed ctDNA detection and enables tuning of assay specificity in order to facilitate distinct clinical applications. Our findings establish the potential of cfDNA for lung cancer screening and highlight the importance of risk-matching cases and controls in cfDNA-based screening studies.

Recently, all-optical diffractive deep neural networks have been created that are based on passive structures and can perform complicated functions designed by computer-based neural networks. However, once a passive diffractive deep neural network architecture is fabricated, its function is fixed. Here we report a programmable diffractive deep neural network that is based on a multi-layer digital-coding metasurface array. Each meta-atom on the metasurfaces is integrated with two amplifier chips and acts an active artificial neuron, providing a dynamic modulation range of 35 dB (from -22 dB to 13 dB). We show that the system, which we term a programmable artificial intelligence machine, can handle various deep learning tasks for wave sensing, including image classification, mobile communication coding-decoding and real-time multi-beam focusing. We also develop a reinforcement learning algorithm for on-site learning and a discrete optimization algorithm for digital coding. Using a multi-layer metasurface array in which each meta-atom of the metasurface acts as an active artificial neuron, a programmable diffractive deep neural network can be created that directly processes electromagnetic waves in free space for wave sensing and wireless communications.

A two-layer Stacking framework is proposed in this study to predict the crash injury severity: The fist layer integrates advantages of three base classification methods: RF (Random Forests), AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), and GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree); the second layer completes classification of crash injury severity based on a Logistic Regression model. A total of 5538 crashes were recorded at 326 freeway diverge areas. In the model calibration, several parameters including the number of trees in three base classification methods, learning rate, and regularization coefficient are optimized via a systematic grid search approach. In the model validation, the performance of the Stacking model is compared with several traditional models including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forests (RF) in the multi classification experiments. The prediction results show that Stacking model achieves superior performance evaluated by two indicators: accuracy and recall. Furthermore, all the factors used in severity prediction are classified into different categories according to their influence on the results, and sensitivity analysis of several significant factors is finally implemented to explore the impact of their value variation on the prediction accuracy.

It is highly desired to predict the medication responses to control the degree of pain for herpes zoster patients. The present study is aimed to elucidate the relationship between medication outcome and neural activity using EEG and to establish a machine learning model for early prediction of the medication responses from EEG. Methods: The authors acquired and analyzed eye-closed resting-state EEG data 1 to 2 days after medication from 70 herpes zoster patients with different drug treatment outcomes (measured 5-6 days after medication): 45 medication-sensitive pain patients and 25 medication-resistant pain patients. EEG power spectral entropy of each frequency band was compared at each channel between medication-sensitive pain and medication-resistant pain patients, and those features showing significant difference between two groups were used to predict medication outcome with different machine learning methods. Results: Medication-sensitive pain patients showed significantly weaker beta-band power spectral entropy in the central-parietal regions than medication-resistant pain patients. Based on these EEG power spectral entropy features and a k-nearest neighbors classifier, the medication outcome can be predicted with 80% +/- 11.7% accuracy, 82.5% +/- 14.7% sensitivity, 77.7% +/- 27.3% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85. Conclusions: EEG beta-band power spectral entropy in the central-parietal region is predictive of the effectiveness of drug treatment on herpes zoster patients, and it could potentially be used for early pain management and therapeutic prognosis.

J	Yildirim, O				Yildirim, Ozal			A novel wavelet sequence based on deep bidirectional LSTM network model for ECG signal classification	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Long-short term memory; Recurrent neural networks; Deep learning; ECG signals	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; BEAT CLASSIFICATION; AUTOMATED DETECTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; TRANSFORM; RECOGNITION; INTEGRATION; ALGORITHM; MACHINE; PCA	Long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), which have recently emerged in sequential data analysis, are the most widely used type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) architecture. Progress on the topic of deep learning includes successful adaptations of deep versions of these architectures. In this study, a new model for deep bidirectional LSTM network-based wavelet sequences called DBLSTM-WS was proposed for classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. For this purpose, a new wavelet-based layer is implemented to generate ECG signal sequences. The ECG signals were decomposed into frequency sub-bands at different scales in this layer. These sub-bands are used as sequences for the input of LSTM networks. New network models that include unidirectional (ULSTM) and bidirectional (BLSTM) structures are designed for performance comparisons. Experimental studies have been performed for five different types of heartbeats obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. These five types are Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Ventricular Premature Contraction (VPC), Paced Beat (PB), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), and Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB). The results show that the DBLSTM-WS model gives a high recognition performance of 99.39%. It has been observed that the wavelet-based layer proposed in the study significantly improves the recognition performance of conventional networks. This proposed network structure is an important approach that can be applied to similar signal processing problems.

However, the vast number of potential catalysts requires pruning of the candidate space by efficient property prediction with quantitative structure-property relationships. Data-driven workflows embedded in a library of potential catalysts can be used to build predictive models for catalyst performance and serve as a blueprint for novel catalyst designs. Herein we introduce kraken, a discovery platform covering monodentate organophosphorus(III) ligands providing comprehensive physicochemical descriptors based on representative conformer ensembles. Using quantum-mechanical methods, we calculated descriptors for 1558 ligands, including commercially available examples, and trained machine learning models to predict properties of over 300000 new ligands. We demonstrate the application of kraken to systematically explore the property space of organophosphorus ligands and how existing data sets in catalysis can be used to accelerate ligand selection during reaction optimization.

With the shift toward sustainable living, it is anticipated that the development of functional materials will continue to be vital for sustaining life on our planet. In the recent decades, rapid progress has been made in materials science and chemistry owing to the advances in experimental, analytical, and computational methods, thereby producing several novel and useful materials. However, most problems in material development are highly complex. Here, the best strategy for the development of functional materials via the implementation of three key concepts is discussed: nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super-accelerator. Discussions from conceptual viewpoints and example recent developments, chiefly focused on nanoporous materials, are presented. It is anticipated that coupling these three strategies together will open advanced routes for the swift design and exploratory search of functional materials truly useful for solving real-world problems. These novel strategies will result in the evolution of nanoporous functional materials.

Among the candidate communications schemes for future wireless networks are non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes that allow serving more than one user in the same resource block by multiplexing users in other domains than frequency or time. In this way, NOMA schemes tend to offer several advantages over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes such as improved user fairness and spectral efficiency, higher cell-edge throughput, massive connectivity support, and low transmission latency. With these merits, NOMA-enabled transmission schemes are being increasingly looked at as promising multiple access schemes for future wireless networks. When the power domain is used to multiplex the users, it is referred to as the power domain NOMA (PD-NOMA). In this paper, we survey the integration of PD-NOMA with the enabling communications schemes and technologies that are expected to meet the various requirements of B5G networks. In particular, this paper surveys the different rate optimization scenarios studied in the literature when PD-NOMA is combined with one or more of the candidate schemes and technologies for B5G networks including multiple-input-single-output (MISO), multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (mMIMO), advanced antenna architectures, higher frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications, advanced coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception schemes, cooperative communications, cognitive radio (CR), visible light communications (VLC), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communications and others. The considered system models, the optimization methods utilized to maximize the achievable rates, and the main lessons learnt on the optimization and the performance of these NOMA-enabled schemes and technologies are discussed in detail along with the future research directions for these combined schemes. Moreover, the role of machine learning in optimizing these NOMA-enabled technologies is addressed.

For this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs and latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed, which ensures full coverage for a given space with a minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from an optimal transport theory. The simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs compared with the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency compared with the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D wireless cellular network of drones.

In fact, several organizations from different sectors depend increasingly on knowledge extracted from huge volumes of data. However, in Big Data context, traditional data techniques and platforms are less efficient. They show a slow responsiveness and lack of scalability, performance and accuracy. To face the complex Big Data challenges, much work has been carried out. As a result, various types of distributions and technologies have been developed. This paper is a review that survey recent technologies developed for Big Data. It aims to help to select and adopt the right combination of different Big Data technologies according to their technological needs and specific applications' requirements. It provides not only a global view of main Big Data technologies but also comparisons according to different system layers such as Data Storage Layer, Data Processing Layer, Data Querying Layer, Data Access Layer and Management Layer. It categorizes and discusses main technologies features, advantages, limits and usages. (C) 2017 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

This paper proposes a homogeneous ensemble approach, i.e., use of Random Forest (RF), for hourly building energy prediction. The approach was adopted to predict the hourly electricity usage of two educational buildings in North Central Florida. The RF models trained with different parameter settings were compared to investigate the impact of parameter setting on the prediction performance of the model. The results indicated that RF was not very sensitive to the number of variables (mtry) and using empirical mtry is preferable because it saves time and is more accurate. RF was compared with regression tree (RT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to validate the superiority of RF in building energy prediction. The prediction performances of RF measured by performance index (PI) were 14-25% and 5-5.5% better than RT and SVR, respectively, indicating that RF was the best prediction model in the comparison. Moreover, an analysis based on the variable importance of RF was performed to identify the most influential features during different semesters. The results showed that the most influential features vary depending on the semester, indicating the existence of different operational conditions for the tested buildings. A further comparison between RF trained with yearly and monthly data indicated that the energy usage prediction for educational buildings could be improved by taking into consideration their energy behavior changes during different semesters.

In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process regression (GPR), a well-known nonparametric, and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. However, they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this article is devoted to reviewing state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations that distillate the entire data and local approximations that divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations that modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations that retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations that exploit specific structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.

The study introduces a novel hybrid integration approach based on J48 Decision Trees (J48), AdaBoost (AB), Bagging (Bag), RandomSubSpace (RS), Dagging (Dag) and Rotation Forest (RF) algorithms for constructing a groundwater spring potential map. The performance of the ensemble models were evaluated at the Wuqi County in Shaanxi Province, China. At first, a groundwater spring inventory map with 235 groundwater springs was constructed. The groundwater spring database was randomly divided into a training (70% of the total number of groundwater springs) and validating subset (remaining 30%). Secondly, sixteen groundwater spring related variables were selected and analyzed, such as elevation, slope, aspect, planform and profile curvature, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream transport and stream power indexes, distance from river network, lithology, soil and landuse cover, normalized difference vegetation index, mean annual rainfall and distance from road network. The contribution of each groundwater spring related variable so as to identify the most predictive was based on the correlation attribute evaluation method. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and several statistical indexes (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity). The outcomes revealed that all models had a good predictive performance, having AUC values greater than 0.74. Specifically, RF-J48 model appeared with the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.797), followed by the AB-J48 model (0.793), the Bag-J48 (0.768), the RS-J48 (0.766) and the Dag-J48 (0.748), respectively. The study highlights that the proposed ensemble methodology is efficient and highly accurate appropriate for groundwater spring potential mapping.

However, it suffers from a known criticism of extensive computational requirements and poor efficiency, which hinders its application in the reliability analysis of earth dam slope stability. Until now, the effects of spatially variable soil properties on the earth dam slope reliability remain unclear. This calls for a novel method to perform reliability analysis of earth dam slope stability accounting for the spatial variability of soil properties. This paper develops an efficient extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based reliability analysis approach for evaluating the earth dam slope failure probability. With the aid of the proposed approach, the failure probability of earth dam slope can be evaluated rationally and efficiently. The proposed approach is illustrated using a practical case adapted from Ashigong earth dam. Results show that the XGBoost-based reliability analysis approach is able to predict the earth dam slope failure probability with reasonable accuracy and efficiency. The coefficient of variations and scale of fluctuations of soil properties affect the earth dam slope failure probability significantly. Moreover, the earth dam slope failure probability is highly dependent on the selection of auto-correlation function (ACF), and the widely used single exponential ACF tends to provide an unconservative estimate in this study.

This paper proposes a novel feature selection method, called AOAGA, using an improved metaheuristic optimization method that combines the conventional Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) operators. The AOA is a recently proposed optimizer; it has been employed to solve several benchmark and engineering problems and has shown a promising performance. The main aim behind the modification of the AOA is to enhance its search strategies. The conventional version suffers from weaknesses, the local search strategy, and the trade-off between the search strategies. Therefore, the operators of the GA can overcome the shortcomings of the conventional AOA. The proposed AOAGA was evaluated with several well-known benchmark datasets, using several standard evaluation criteria, namely accuracy, number of selected features, and fitness function. Finally, the results were compared with the state-of-the-art techniques to prove the performance of the proposed AOAGA method. Moreover, to further assess the performance of the proposed AOAGA method, two real-world problems containing gene datasets were used.

Many popular methods, such as antibody labeling, are used to add physical fluorescent labels to specific cellular constituents. However, these approaches have significant drawbacks, including inconsistency; limitations in the number of simultaneous labels because of spectral overlap; and necessary perturbations of the experiment, such as fixing the cells, to generate the measurement. Here, we show that a computational machine- learning approach, which we call "in silico labeling'' (ISL), reliably predicts some fluorescent labels from transmitted- light images of unlabeled fixed or live biological samples. ISL predicts a range of labels, such as those for nuclei, cell type (e.g., neural), and cell state (e.g., cell death). Because prediction happens in silico, the method is consistent, is not limited by spectral overlap, and does not disturb the experiment. ISL generates biological measurements that would otherwise be problematic or impossible to acquire.	[Christiansen, Eric M.; Yang, Samuel J.; Ando, D.

Unfortunately, user click frequency data are usually absent in practice. It remains challenging to predict the click feature from the visual feature, because the user click frequency vector of an image is always noisy and sparse. In this paper, we devise a Hierarchical Deep Word Embedding (HDWE) model by integrating sparse constraints and an improved RELU operator to address click feature prediction from visual features. HDWE is a coarse-to-fine click feature predictor that is learned with the help of an auxiliary image dataset containing click information. It can therefore discover the hierarchy of word semantics. We evaluate HDWE on three dog and one bird image datasets, in which Clickture-Dog and Clickture-Bird are utilized as auxiliary datasets to provide click data, respectively. Our empirical studies show that HDWE has 1) higher recognition accuracy, 2) a larger compression ratio, and 3) good one-shot learning ability and scalability to unseen categories.

The accuracies of the best model ranged between 74% for spruce and 87% for deciduous forest. An overall accuracy of 90% was found on stand level using independent data from more than 42 000 stands. Errors mostly resulting from a forest mask reduced the model accuracies by similar to 10%. The produced map was subsequently used to generate model-assisted (MA) and poststratified (PS) estimates of species-specific forest area. At the national level, efficiencies of the estimates increased by 20% to 50% for MA and up to 90% for PS. Greater minimum numbers of observations constrained the use of PS. For MA estimates of municipalities, efficiencies improved by up to a factor of 8 but were sometimes also less than 1. PS estimates were always equally as or more precise than direct and MA estimates but were applicable in fewer municipalities. The tree species prediction map is part of the Norwegian forest resource map and is used, among others, to improve maps of other variables of interest such as timber volume and biomass.

However, it is generally difficult or expensive to label the monitoring data in practical engineering due to its complex working conditions. Therefore, an unsupervised fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper for rolling bearings, which incorporates short-time Fourier transform (STFT) as well as categorical generative adversarial networks (CatGAN). The proposed method first adopts STFT to transform raw 1-D vibration signals into 2-D time-frequency maps to serve as the input of CatGAN. Then, it obtains a CatGAN model via an adversarial training process to generate fake samples with a similar distribution to the maps extracted by STFT and cluster the input samples into certain categories. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed ST-CatGAN method is verified using a classic rotating machinery dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate its high diagnosis accuracy and strong robustness against the motor load changes.

Compared with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest computed tomography (CT) imaging may be a significantly more trustworthy, useful, and rapid technique to classify and evaluate COVID-19, specifically in the epidemic region. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals' precious time. In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (-ve). Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the proposed and the competitive machine learning techniques on the chest CT images. Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the chest CT images at a good accuracy rate.

Although l(2,1) norm based NMF improves the robustness, it is still affected easily by large noises. Second, for most graph regularized NMF, the performance highly depends on the initial similarity graph. Third, many graph-based NMF models perform the graph construction and matrix factorization in two separated steps. Thus the learned graph structure may not be optimal. To overcome the above drawbacks, we propose a robust bi-stochastic graph regularized matrix factorization (RBSMF) framework for data clustering. Specifically, we present a general loss function, which is more robust than the commonly used L-2 and L-1 functions. Besides, instead of keeping the graph fixed, we learn an adaptive similarity graph. Furthermore, the graph updating and matrix factorization are processed simultaneously, which can make the learned graph more appropriate for clustering. Extensive experiments have shown the proposed RBSMF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

J	Li, X; Zhang, W; Ding, Q				Li, Xiang; Zhang, Wei; Ding, Qian			Cross-Domain Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Element Bearings Using Deep Generative Neural Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Deep learning; domain adaptation (DA); fault diagnosis; generative model	FEATURES	Despite the recent advances on intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, existing research works mostly assume training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, due to variation of operating condition, domain shift phenomenon generally exists, which results in significant diagnosis performance deterioration. To address cross-domain problems, latest research works preferably apply domain adaptation techniques on marginal data distributions. However, it is usually assumed that sufficient testing data are available for training, that is not in accordance with most transfer tasks in real industries where only data inmachine healthy condition can be collected in advance. This paper proposes a novel cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on deep generative neural networks. By artificially generating fake samples for domain adaptation, the proposed method is able to provide reliable cross-domain diagnosis results when testing data in machine fault conditions are not available for training. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach for industrial applications.

J	Wexler, R				Wexler, Rebecca			Life, Liberty, and Trade Secrets: Intellectual Property in the Criminal Justice System	STANFORD LAW REVIEW			English	Article							EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES; SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE; DUE-PROCESS; LAW; MACHINE; DEFENDANTS; DNA; 4TH-AMENDMENT; 6TH-AMENDMENT; ALGORITHMS	The criminal justice system is becoming automated. At every stage, from policing to evidence to parole, machine learning and other computer systems guide outcomes. Widespread debates over the pros and cons of these technologies have overlooked a crucial issue: ownership. Developers often claim that details about how their tools work are trade secrets and refuse to disclose that information to criminal defendants or their attorneys. The introduction of intellectual property claims into the criminal justice system raises undertheorized tensions between life, liberty, and property interests. This Article offers the first wide-ranging account of trade secret evidence in criminal cases and develops a framework to address the problems that result. In sharp contrast to the general view among trial courts, legislatures, and scholars alike, this Article argues that trade secrets should not be privileged in criminal proceedings. A criminal trade secret privilege is ahistorical, harmful to defendants, and unnecessary to protect the interests of the secret holder. Meanwhile, compared to substantive trade secret law, the privilege overprotects intellectual property. Further, privileging trade secrets in criminal proceedings fails to serve the theoretical purposes behind either trade secret law or privilege law. The trade secret inquiry sheds new light on how evidence rules do, and should, function differently in civil and criminal cases.

Critical review of the literature was performed to understand the state of research in utilizing biochars for industrial wastewater remediation with emphasis on pollutants that co-exist in wastewater from several industrial activities, such as textile, pharmaceutical and mining industries. Such pollutants include organic (such as synthetic dyes, phenolic compounds) and inorganic contaminants (such as cadmium, lead). Multiple correspondence analyses suggest that through batch equilibrium, columns or constructed wetlands, researchers have used mechanistic modelling of isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics to evaluate contaminant removal in either synthetic or real industrial wastewaters. The removal of organic and inorganic contaminants in wastewater by biochar follows several mechanisms: precipitation, surface complexation, ion exchange, cation-p interaction, and electrostatic attraction. Biochar production and modifications promote good adsorption capacity for those pollutants because biochar properties stemming from production were linked to specific adsorption mechanisms, such as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. For instance, adsorption capacity of malachite green ranged from 30.2 to 4066.9 mg g(-1) depending on feedstock type, pyrolysis temperature, and chemical modifications. Pyrolyzing biomass at above 500 degrees C might improve biochar quality to target co-existing pollutants. Treating biochars with acids can also improve pollutant removal, except that the contribution of precipitation is reduced for potentially toxic elements. Studies on artificial intelligence and machine learning are still in their infancy in wastewater remediation with biochars. Meanwhile, a framework for integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning into biochar wastewater remediation systems is proposed. The reutilization and disposal of spent biochar and the contaminant release from spent biochar are important areas that need to be further studied. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Performance degradation assessment is an important work in bearing condition-based maintenance (CBM) and predictive maintenance. In this paper, a data-driven bearing performance degradation assessment method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed to comprehensively utilize the fault propagation information. Firstly, universal degradation simulation model based on vibration response mechanism is constructed for feature verification. A new proposed indicator "waveform entropy (WFE)" is developed and validated by this simulation model. Then waveform entropy and other conventional indicators are input into the LSTM RNN to identify the bearing running state, while particle swarm optimization method is applied to optimize the network structure parameters simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that LSTM RNN can effectively identify the bearing degradation states and accurately predict the remaining useful life. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R-2) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R-2 and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.

A total of 219 slide inventories and 17 slide conditioning variables were obtained for modelling. The data showed a complex scenario. Some past slides have spread over steep lands, while others have spread through flat terrain. Random forest (RF) served to keep only important factors for further analysis as a preprocessing measure. To select CNN hyperparameters, Bayesian optimization was used. Three methods contributed to overcoming the overfitting issue owing to small training data in our research. The selection of key factors by RF helped first of all to reduce information dimensionality. Second, the CNN model with 1D convolutions was intended to considerably decrease the number of its parameters. Third, a high rate of drop-out (0.66) helped reduce the CNN parameters. Overall accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) and 5-fold cross-validation were used to evaluate the models. CNN performance was compared to ANN and SVM. CNN achieved the highest accuracy on testing dataset (83.11%) and AUROC (0.880, 0.893, using testing and 5-fold CV, respectively). Bayesian optimization enhanced CNN accuracy by similar to 3% (compared with default configuration). CNN could outperform ANN and SVM owing to its complicated architecture and handling of spatial correlations through convolution and pooling operations. In complex situations where some variables make a non-linear contribution to the occurrence of landslides, the method suggested could thus help develop landslide susceptibility maps.

Using data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify innovations by their underlying technologies. We find that most FinTech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable. For the overall financial sector, internet of things (IoT), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types. Innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

A new, high-order neuron was developed for the deep neural network model to improve the performance of the model. Moreover, the cross-entropy cost function and rectified linear unit activation function were employed to enhance the performance of the model. The present model was then applied to predict the compressive strength of foamed concrete through a given data set, and the obtained results were compared with other machine learning methods including conventional artificial neural network (C-ANN) and second-order artificial neural network (SO-ANN). To further validate the proposed model, a new data set from the laboratory and a given data set of high-performance concrete were used to obtain a higher degree of confidence in the prediction. It is shown that the proposed model obtained a better prediction, compared to other methods. In contrast to C-ANN and SO-ANN, the proposed model can genuinely improve its performance when training a deep neural network model with multiple hidden layers. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of the input variables on the compressive strength. The results indicated that the compressive strength of foamed concrete is greatly affected by density, followed by the water-to-cement and sand-to-cement ratios. By providing a reliable prediction tool, the proposed model can aid researchers and engineers in mixture design optimization of foamed concrete.

Here, we approach this problem by modeling a neural network architecture after the human physical reasoning process, which has similarities to representation learning. This allows us to make progress towards the long-term goal of machine-assisted scientific discovery from experimental data without making prior assumptions about the system. We apply this method to toy examples and show that the network finds the physically relevant parameters, exploits conservation laws to make predictions, and can help to gain conceptual insights, e.g., Copernicus' conclusion that the solar system is heliocentric.

However, their application in machine learning have largely been limited to very shallow neural network architectures for simple problems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic technique for generating an SNN with a deep architecture, and demonstrate its effectiveness on complex visual recognition problems such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Our technique applies to both VGG and Residual network architectures, with significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art. Finally, we present analysis of the sparse event-driven computations to demonstrate reduced hardware overhead when operating in the spiking domain.

DNA methylation modification affects a series of biological processes, such as eukaryotic cell growth, differentiation, and transformation mechanisms, by regulating gene expression. In this review, we systematically summarized the DNA methylation databases, prediction tools for DNA methylation modification, machine learning algorithms for predicting DNA methylation modification, and the relationship between DNA methylation modification and diseases such as hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, diabetic nephropathy, and cancer. An in-depth understanding of DNA methylation mechanisms can promote accurate prediction of DNA methylation modifications and the treatment and diagnosis of related diseases.

Moreover, there are a very limited number of subjects available, which cannot guarantee to find informative and discriminative patterns for achieving high diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse regression method to fuse the auxiliary data into the predictor data for the pMCI/sMCI classification, where the predictor data is structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) information of both pMCI and sMCI subjects and the auxiliary data includes the ages of the subjects, the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) information of the predictor data, and the structural MRI information of AD and Normal Controls (NC). Specifically, we incorporate the auxiliary data and the predictor data into a unified framework to jointly achieve the following objectives: i) jointly selecting informative features from both the auxiliary data and the predictor data; ii) robust to outliers from both the auxiliary data and the predictor data; and iii) reducing the aging effect due to the possible cause of brain atrophy induced by both the normal aging and the disease progression. As a result, our proposed method jointly selects the useful features from the auxiliary data and the predictor data by taking into account the influence of outliers and the age of the two kinds of data, i.e., the pMCI and sMCI subjects as well as the AD and NC subjects. We further employ the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the selected features of the predictor data to conduct the pMCI/sMCI classification. Experimental results on the public data of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show the proposed method achieved the best classification performance, compared to the best comparison method, in terms of four evaluation metrics.

The rapid development of machine-learning techniques and artificial intelligence in particular has promised to revolutionize medical practice from the allocation of resources to the diagnosis of complex diseases. But with big data comes big risks and challenges, among them significant questions about patient privacy. Here, we outline the legal and ethical challenges big data brings to patient privacy. We discuss, among other topics, how best to conceive of health privacy; the importance of equity, consent, and patient governance in data collection; discrimination in data uses; and how to handle data breaches. We close by sketching possible ways forward for the regulatory system.	[Price, W. Nicholson] Univ Michigan, Law Sch, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Price, W. Nicholson; Cohen, I.

To answer this question, we investigate data on over 1200 travel and leisure companies in 52 countries. We consider 80 characteristics, such as company financial ratios, macroeconomic variables, and government policy responses. Using regressions and machine learning tools, we demonstrate that firms with low valuations, limited leverage, and high investments have been more immune to the pandemic-induced crash. We also find a beneficial effect of stringent containment and closure policies. Finally, our results indicate that countries with less individualism may be better positioned to cope with the pandemic. Our findings have implications for regulatory bodies, managers, and investors concerning future pandemic outbreaks.

Unsupervised neural network models of the ventral visual stream	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						ventral visual stream; deep neural networks; unsupervised algorithms	RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; AREA V4; RECOGNITION; INFANTS; INFORMATION; SELECTIVITY; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; FEATURES; PATHWAY	Deep neural networks currently provide the best quantitative models of the response patterns of neurons throughout the primate ventral visual stream. However, such networks have remained implausible as a model of the development of the ventral stream, in part because they are trained with supervised methods requiring many more labels than are accessible to infants during development. Here, we report that recent rapid progress in unsupervised learning has largely closed this gap. We find that neural network models learned with deep unsupervised contrastive embedding methods achieve neural prediction accuracy in multiple ventral visual cortical areas that equals or exceeds that of models derived using today's best supervised methods and that the mapping of these neural network models' hidden layers is neuroanatomically consistent across the ventral stream. Strikingly, we find that these methods produce brainlike representations even when trained solely with real human child developmental data collected from head-mounted cameras, despite the fact that these datasets are noisy and limited. We also find that semisupervised deep contrastive embeddings can leverage small numbers of labeled examples to produce representations with substantially improved error-pattern consistency to human behavior. Taken together, these results illustrate a use of unsupervised learning to provide a quantitative model of a multiarea cortical brain system and present a strong candidate for a biologically plausible computational theory of primate sensory learning.

This article presents a new semisupervised method for medical image segmentation, where the network is optimized by a weighted combination of a common supervised loss only for the labeled inputs and a regularization loss for both the labeled and unlabeled data. To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under different perturbations. With the semisupervised segmentation tasks, we introduce a transformation-consistent strategy in the self-ensembling model to enhance the regularization effect for pixel-level predictions. To further improve the regularization effects, we extend the transformation in a more generalized form including scaling and optimize the consistency loss with a teacher model, which is an averaging of the student model weights. We extensively validated the proposed semisupervised method on three typical yet challenging medical image segmentation tasks: 1) skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images in the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 data set; 2) optic disk (OD) segmentation from fundus images in the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE) data set; and 3) liver segmentation from volumetric CT scans in the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) data set. Compared with state-of-the-art, our method shows superior performance on the challenging 2-D/3-D medical images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our semisupervised method for medical image segmentation.

Materials and Methods: PubMed MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched to identify original research articles published between January 1, 2018 and August 17, 2018 that investigated the performance of AI algorithms that analyze medical images to provide diagnostic decisions. Eligible articles were evaluated to determine 1) whether the study used external validation rather than internal validation, and in case of external validation, whether the data for validation were collected, 2) with diagnostic cohort design instead of diagnostic case-control design, 3) from multiple institutions, and 4) in a prospective manner. These are fundamental methodologic features recommended for clinical validation of AI performance in real-world practice. The studies that fulfilled the above criteria were identified. We classified the publishing journals into medical vs. non-medical journal groups. Then, the results were compared between medical and non-medical journals Results: Of 516 eligible published studies, only 6% (31 studies) performed external validation. None of the 31 studies adopted all three design features: diagnostic cohort design, the inclusion of multiple institutions, and prospective data collection for external validation. No significant difference was found between medical and non-medical journals. Conclusion: Nearly all of the studies published in the study period that evaluated the performance of AI algorithms for diagnostic analysis of medical images were designed as proof-of-concept technical feasibility studies and did not have the design features that are recommended for robust validation of the real-world clinical performance of AI algorithms.

For correct action recognition, various local and global points are requires known as features. These features modified during the variation in human movement. But due to a bit change in several human actions, the features of these actions are mixed that degrade the recognition performance. In this article, we design a new 26-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for accurate complex action recognition. The features are extracted from the global average pooling layer and fully connected (FC) layer, and fused by a proposed high entropy-based approach. Further, we propose a feature selection method name Poisson distribution along with Univariate Measures (PDaUM). Few of fused CNN features are irrelevant, and few of them are redundant that makes the incorrect prediction among complex human actions. Therefore, the proposed PDaUM based approach selects only the strongest features that later passed to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Softmax for final recognition. Four datasets are using for experimental analysis - HMDB51 (51 classes), UCF Sports (10 classes), KTH (6 classes), and Weizmann (10 classes). On these datasets, the ELM classifier gives an improved performance as compared to a Softmax classifier. The achieved accuracy on each dataset is 81.4%, 99.2%, 98.3%, and 98.7%, respectively. Comparison with existing techniques, it is shown that the proposed architecture gives better performance in terms of accuracy and testing time.				sanghyun@cau.ac.kr	Tariq, Usman/AAE-8037-2022; Freienberg, Selina/AAV-8829-2021; Tariq, Usman/AAF-8954-2020; Javed, Abdul Rehman/ABB-2826-2020; Khan, Junaid Ali/ABG-2756-2020; Khan, Dr. Muhammad Attique/AAX-2644-2021; Javed, Abdul Rehman/AAR-7021-2020; Zhang, Yudong/I-7633-2013	Tariq, Usman/0000-0001-7672-1187; Khan, Junaid Ali/0000-0003-2630-1744; Khan, Dr. Muhammad Attique/0000-0002-6347-4890; Javed, Abdul Rehman/0000-0002-0570-1813; Zhang, Yudong/0000-0002-4870-1493; Abbasi, Aaqif Afzaal/0000-0002-9982-1321; habib, usman/0000-0003-4793-6239; Ihsan, Mansoor/0000-0002-8753-7884	National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [NRF-2019R1F1A1058715]	National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of KoreaMinistry of Science & ICT (MSIT), Republic of Korea)	This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (NRF-2019R1F1A1058715).		44	95	95	23	44	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	1380-7501	1573-7721		MULTIMED TOOLS APPL	Multimed.

FS can be considered as an optimisation problem. Due to the difficulty of this problem and having a large number of local solutions, stochastic optimisation algorithms are promising techniques to solve this problem. As a seminal attempt, binary variants of the recent Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (GOA) are proposed in this work and employed to select the optimal feature subset for classification purposes within a wrapper-based framework. Two mechanisms are employed to design a binary GOA, the first one is based on Sigmoid and V-shaped transfer functions, and will be indicated by BGOA-S and BGOA-V, respectively. While the second mechanism uses a novel technique that combines the best solution obtained so far. In addition, a mutation operator is employed to enhance the exploration phase in BGOA algorithm (BGOA-M). The proposed methods are evaluated using 25 standard UCI datasets and compared with 8 well-regarded metaheuristic wrapper-based approaches, and six well known filter-based (e.g., correlation FS) approaches. The comparative results show the superior performance of the BGOA and BGOA-M methods compared to other similar techniques in the literature. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At traintime the quantized weights and activations are used for computing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass, QNNs drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations. As a result, power consumption is expected to be drastically reduced. We trained QNNs over the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet datasets. The resulting QNNs achieve prediction accuracy comparable to their 32-bit counterparts. For example, our quantized version of AlexNet with 1-bit weights and 2-bit activations achieves 51% top-1 accuracy. Moreover, we quantize the parameter gradients to 6-bits as well which enables gradients computation using only bit-wise operation. Quantized recurrent neural networks were tested over the Penn Treebank dataset, and achieved comparable accuracy as their 32-bit counterparts using only 4-bits. Last but not least, we programmed a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST QNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification accuracy. The QNN code is available online.

Good quality disease severity data should be accurate (close to the true value). Earliest quantification of disease severity was by visual estimates. Sensor-based image analysis including visible spectrum and hyperspectral and multispectral sensors are established technologies that promise to substitute, or complement visual ratings. Indeed, these technologies have measured disease severity accurately under controlled conditions but are yet to demonstrate their full potential for accurate measurement under field conditions. Sensor technology is advancing rapidly, and artificial intelligence may help overcome issues for automating severity measurement under hyper-variable field conditions. The adoption of appropriate scales, training, instruction and aids (standard area diagrams) has contributed to improved accuracy of visual estimates. The apogee of accuracy for visual estimation is likely being approached, and any remaining increases in accuracy are likely to be small. Due to automation and rapidity, sensor-based measurement offers potential advantages compared with visual estimates, but the latter will remain important for years to come. Mobile, automated sensor-based systems will become increasingly common in controlled conditions and, eventually, in the field for measuring plant disease severity for the purpose of research and decision making.

J	Singh, D; Kumar, V; Yadav, V; Kaur, M				Singh, Dilbag; Kumar, Vijay; Yadav, Vaishali; Kaur, Manjit			Deep Neural Network-Based Screening Model for COVID-19-Infected Patients Using Chest X-Ray Images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Chest X-ray; COVID-19; classification; deep neural networks		There are limited coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing kits, therefore, development of other diagnosis approaches is desirable. The doctors generally utilize chest X-rays and Computed Tomography (CT) scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes. Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, therefore, X-ray images are utilized in this paper, to classify the patients with infected (COVID-19 +ve) and uninfected (COVID-19 -ve) lungs. Almost all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, therefore, the chest X-ray images can be used to test for COVID-19 without utilizing any kind of dedicated test kits. However, the chest X-ray-based COVID-19 classification requires a radiology expert and significant time, which is precious when COVID-19 infection is increasing at a rapid rate. Therefore, the development of an automated analysis approach is desirable to save the medical professionals' valuable time. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach is designed and implemented. Besides, the hyper-parameters of CNN are tuned using Multi-objective Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the benchmark COVID-19 dataset. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed technique outperforms the competitive machine learning models in terms of various performance metrics.

The challenged aims to detect signals of new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using unsupervised machine learning algorithms. First, we propose how an anomaly score could be implemented to define model-independent signal regions in LHC searches. We define and describe a large benchmark dataset, consisting of > 1 billion simulated LHC events corresponding to 10 fb(-1) of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. We then review a wide range of anomaly detection and density estimation algorithms, developed in the context of the data challenge, and we measure their performance in a set of realistic analysis environments. We draw a number of useful conclusions that will aid the development of unsupervised new physics searches during the third run of the LHC, and provide our benchmark dataset for future studies at https://www.phenoMLdata.org.

Pyroptosis, a kind of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death, has been linked to cancer in recent studies. However, the value of pyroptosis in the diagnosis and prognosis of SKCM is not clear. In this study, it was discovered that 20 pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) differed in expression between SKCM and normal tissues, which were related to diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, based on these genes, nine machine-learning algorithms were shown to perform well in constructing diagnostic classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Secondly, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was applied and the prognostic model was constructed based on 9 PRGs. Subgroups in low and high risks determined by the prognostic model were shown to have different survival. Thirdly, functional enrichment analyses were performed by applying the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and results suggested that the risk was related to immune response. In conclusion, the expression signatures of pyroptosis-related genes are effective and robust in the diagnosis and prognosis of SKCM, which is related to immunity.

The approximate multiplication can reduce the cost of the underlying circuits so that CNN inferences can be performed more efficiently in hardware accelerators. The study identifies the critical factors in the convolution, fully-connected, and batch normalization layers that allow more accurate CNN predictions despite the errors from approximate multiplication. The same factors also provide an arithmetic explanation of why bfloat16 multiplication performs well on CNNs. The experiments are performed with recognized network architectures to show that the approximate multipliers can produce predictions that are nearly as accurate as the FP32 references, without additional training. For example, the ResNet and Inception-v4 models with Mitch-w6 multiplication produces Top-5 errors that are within 0.2 percent compared to the FP32 references. A brief cost comparison of Mitch-w6 against bfloat16 is presented where a MAC operation saves up to 80 percent of energy compared to the bfloat16 arithmetic. The most far-reaching contribution of this article is the analytical justification that multiplications can be approximated while additions need to be exact in CNN MAC operations.

Large gradients via correlation in random parameterized quantum circuits	QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						variational quantum algorithms; quantum machine learning; quantum alternating operator ansatz; Grover's algorithm	ALGORITHM	Scaling of variational quantum algorithms to large problem sizes requires efficient optimization of random parameterized quantum circuits. For such circuits with uncorrelated parameters, the presence of exponentially vanishing gradients in cost function landscapes is an obstacle to optimization by gradient descent methods. In this work, we prove that reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space by utilizing circuit modules containing spatially or temporally correlated gate layers can allow one to circumvent the vanishing gradient phenomenon. Examples are drawn from random separable circuits and asymptotically optimal variational versions of Grover's algorithm based on the quantum alternating operator ansatz. In the latter scenario, our bounds on cost function variation imply a transition between vanishing gradients and efficient trainability as the number of layers is increased toward O(2n/2)<i, the optimal oracle complexity of quantum unstructured search.

In solving many real-world optimization problems, however, such objective functions may not exist. Instead, computationally expensive numerical simulations or costly physical experiments must be performed for fitness evaluations. In more extreme cases, only historical data are available for performing optimization and no new data can be generated during optimization. Solving evolutionary optimization problems driven by data collected in simulations, physical experiments, production processes, or daily life are termed data-driven evolutionary optimization.

Deva			MolGPT: Molecular Generation Using a Transformer-Decoder Model	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							PREDICTION; DATABASE	Application of deep learning techniques for de novo generation of molecules, termed as inverse molecular design, has been gaining enormous traction in drug design. The representation of molecules in SMILES notation as a string of characters enables the usage of state of the art models in natural language processing, such as Transformers, for molecular design in general. Inspired by generative pre-training (GPT) models that have been shown to be successful in generating meaningful text, we train a transformer-decoder on the next token prediction task using masked self-attention for the generation of druglike molecules in this study. We show that our model, MolGPT, performs on par with other previously proposed modern machine learning frameworks for molecular generation in terms of generating valid, unique, and novel molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can be trained conditionally to control multiple properties of the generated molecules. We also show that the model can be used to generate molecules with desired scaffolds as well as desired molecular properties by conditioning the generation on scaffold SMILES strings of desired scaffolds and property values. Using saliency maps, we highlight the interpretability of the generative process of the model.	[Bagal, Viraj; Aggarwal, Rishal; Vinod, P. K.; Priyakumar, U.

The expensively learning recognition model for big data analysis is typically an obstacle for most traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms, whereas the convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep neural network, can automatically extract features for accurate classification. In this study, we propose an approach using a dense CNN model for underwater target recognition. The network architecture is designed to cleverly reuse all former feature maps to optimize classification rates under various impaired conditions while satisfying low computational cost. In addition, instead of using time-frequency spectrogram images, the proposed scheme allows directly utilizing the original audio signal in the time domain as the network input data. Based on the experimental results evaluated on the real-world data set of passive sonar, our classification model achieves the overall accuracy of 98.85% at 0-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and outperforms traditional ML techniques, as well as other state-of-the-art CNN models.

It is difficult to develop a robust method to detect faults in bearings based on signal processing techniques. In this paper, convolutional neural network based hidden Markov models (CNN-HMMs) are presented to classify multi-faults in mechanical systems. In CNN-HMMs, a CNN model is first employed to learn data features automatically from raw vibration signals. By utilizing the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) technique, feature visualization is constructed to manifest the powerful learning ability of CNN. Then, HMMs are employed as a strong stability tool to classify faults. Both the benchmark data and experimental data are applied to the CNN-HMMs. Classification results confirm the superior performance of the present combination model by comparing with CNN model alone, support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation (BP) neural network. It is shown that the average classification accuracy ratios are 98.125% and 98% for two data series with agreeable error rate reductions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, identifying therapeutic peptides and exploring their properties are important. Although several studies have proposed different machine learning methods to predict peptides as being therapeutic peptides, most do not explain the decision factors of model in detail. In this work, an Interpretable Therapeutic Peptide Prediction (ITP-Pred) model based on efficient feature fusion was developed. First, we proposed three kinds of feature descriptors based on sequence and physicochemical property encoded, namely amino acid composition (AAC), group AAC and coding autocorrelation, and concatenated them to obtain the feature representation of therapeutic peptide. Then, we input it into the CNN-Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to automatically learn recognition of therapeutic peptides. The cross-validation and independent verification experiments results indicated that ITP-Pred has a higher prediction performance on the benchmark dataset than other comparison methods. Finally, we analyzed the output of the model from two aspects: sequence order and physical and chemical properties, mining important features as guidance for the design of better models that can complement existing methods.

However, this problem becomes more challenging for a mixed type of data or while there is overlapping between classes. Classimbalance prob-lem requires a robust learning system which can timely predict and classify the data. We propose a new adversarial network for simultaneous classification and fault detection. In particular, we restore the balance in the imbalanced dataset by generating faulty samples from the proposed mixture of data distribution. We designed the discriminator of our model to handle the generated faulty samples to prevent outlier and overfitting. We empirically demonstrate that; (i) the discriminator trained with a generator to generates samples from a mixture of normal and faulty data distribution which can be considered as a fault detector; (ii), the quality of the generated faulty samples outperforms the other synthetic resampling techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed model performs well when comparing to other fault diagnosis methods across several evaluation metrics; in particular, coalescing of generative adversarial network (GAN) and feature matching function is effective at recognizing faulty samples.

Hybrid Fruit-Fly Optimization Algorithm with K-Means for Text Document Clustering	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						machine learning; text document clustering; metaheuristic algorithms; fruit-fly optimization algorithm; K-means		The fast-growing Internet results in massive amounts of text data. Due to the large volume of the unstructured format of text data, extracting relevant information and its analysis becomes very challenging. Text document clustering is a text-mining process that partitions the set of text-based documents into mutually exclusive clusters in such a way that documents within the same group are similar to each other, while documents from different clusters differ based on the content. One of the biggest challenges in text clustering is partitioning the collection of text data by measuring the relevance of the content in the documents. Addressing this issue, in this work a hybrid swarm intelligence algorithm with a K-means algorithm is proposed for text clustering. First, the hybrid fruit-fly optimization algorithm is tested on ten unconstrained CEC2019 benchmark functions. Next, the proposed method is evaluated on six standard benchmark text datasets. The experimental evaluation on the unconstrained functions, as well as on text-based documents, indicated that the proposed approach is robust and superior to other state-of-the-art methods.

The approach makes use of big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and nowcast data corresponding to time-dependent traffic situations and hydro-meteorological conditions respectively. An Avoidance Behavior-based Collision Detection Model (ABCD-M) is introduced to identify potential collision scenarios and Collision Risk Indices (CRIs) are quantified when evasive actions are taken for each detected collision scenario in various voyages. The method is applied on Ro-Pax ships operating over 13 months of the ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that collision risk estimates may be extremely diverse among voyages, and in 97.5% of potential collision scenarios the evasive actions are triggered only when risk is at 45% or more of its maximum value. The overall CRI for ships operating over the given area tends to be lower for adverse hydro-meteorological conditions. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may assist with the (1) identification of critical scenarios in various voyages not currently accounted for by existing accident databases, (2) definition of commonly agreed risk criteria to set off alarms, (3) the estimation of risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations.

J	An, P; Wang, ZY; Zhang, CJ				An, Peng; Wang, Zhiyuan; Zhang, Chunjiong			Ensemble unsupervised autoencoders and Gaussian mixture model for cyberattack detection	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Multidomain data; Cyberattacks; Deep autoencoder; GMM		Previous studies have adopted unsupervised machine learning with dimension reduction functions for cyberattack detection, which are limited to performing robust anomaly detection with high-dimensional and sparse data. Most of them usually assume homogeneous parameters with a specific Gaussian distribution for each domain, ignoring the robust testing of data skewness. This paper proposes to use unsupervised ensemble autoencoders connected to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to adapt to multiple domains regardless of the skewness of each domain. In the hidden space of the ensemble autoencoder, the attention-based latent representation and reconstructed features of the minimum error are utilized. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the sample density in the GMM. When the estimated sample density exceeds the learning threshold obtained in the training phase, the sample is identified as an outlier related to an attack anomaly. Finally, the ensemble autoencoder and the GMM are jointly optimized, which transforms the optimization of objective function into a Lagrangian dual problem. Experiments conducted on three public data sets validate that the performance of the proposed model is significantly competitive with the selected anomaly detection baselines.

The emerging renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics (PVs) introduce new potential vulnerabilities. Based on the electric waveform data measured by waveform sensors in the distribution power networks, in this article, we propose a novel high-dimensional data-driven cyber physical attack detection and identification (HCADI) approach. First, we analyze the cyber and physical attack impacts (including cyber attacks on the solar inverter causing unusual harmonics) on electric waveforms in the distribution power grids. Then, we construct a high-dimensional streaming data feature matrix based on signal analysis of multiple sensors in the network. Next, we propose a novel mechanism including leverage score-based attack detection and binary matrix factorization-based attack diagnosis. By leveraging the data structure and binary coding, our HCADI approach does not need the training stage for both detection and the root cause diagnosis, which is needed for machine learning/deep learning-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to use raw electrical waveform data to detect and identify the power electronics cyber/physical attacks in distribution power grids with PVs.

Recently, social media have become an increasingly important source of information on human-nature interactions. However, the use of advanced methods for analysing social media is still limited, and social media data are not used to their full potential. In this article, we present available sources of social media data and approaches to mining and analysing these data for conservation science. Specifically, we (i) describe what kind of relevant information can be retrieved from social media platforms, (ii) provide a detailed overview of advanced methods for spatio-temporal, content and network analyses, (iii) exemplify the potential of these approaches for real-world conservation challenges, and (iv) discuss the limitations of social media data analysis in conservation science. Combined with other data sources and carefully considering the biases and ethical issues, social media data can provide a complementary and cost-efficient information source for addressing the grand challenges of biodiversity conservation in the Anthropocene epoch.

J	Chen, QY; Allot, A; Lu, ZY				Chen, Qingyu; Allot, Alexis; Lu, Zhiyong			LitCovid: an open database of COVID-19 literature	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article								Since the outbreak of the current pandemic in 2020, there has been a rapid growth of published articles on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, with about 10 000 new articles added each month. This is causing an increasingly serious information overload, making it difficult for scientists, healthcare professionals and the general public to remain up to date on the latest SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research. Hence, we developed LitCovid (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ research/ coronavirus/), a curated literature hub, to track up-to-date scientific information in PubMed. Lit-Covid is updated daily with newly identified relevant articles organized into curated categories. To support manual curation, advanced machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms have been developed, evaluated and integrated into the curation workflow. To the best of our knowledge, LitCovid is the first-of-its-kind COVID-19-specific literature resource, with all of its collected articles and curated data freely available. Since its release, LitCovid has been widely used, with millions of accesses by users worldwide for various information needs, such as evidence synthesis, drug discovery and text and data mining, among others.

In order to improve the performance of machine vision in fruit detection for a strawberry harvesting robot, Mask Region Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN) was introduced. Resnet50 was adopted as backbone network, combined with the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture for feature extraction. The Region Proposal Network (RPN) was trained end-to-end to create region proposals for each feature map. After generating mask images of ripe fruits from Mask R-CNN, a visual localization method for strawberry picking points was performed. Fruit detection results of 100 test images showed that the average detection precision rate was 95.78%, the recall rate was 95.41% and the mean intersection over union (MIoU) rate for instance segmentation was 89.85%. The prediction results of 573 ripe fruit picking points showed that the average error was +/- 1.2 mm. Compared with four traditional methods, the method proposed demonstrates improved universality and robustness in a non-structural environment, particularly for overlapping and hidden fruits, and those under varying illumination.

For this purpose, three soil quality indices (SQIs: additive soil quality index (SQI(a)), nemoro soil quality index (SQI(n)) and weighted additive soil quality index (SQI(w))) and two datasets (the total data set (TDS) and minimum data set (MDS)) were determined. The linear (L) and non-linear (NL) scoring systems were also used to calculate each SQI. Eight soil properties, including pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), electrical conductivity (EC), bulk density (BD), soil microbial respiration (SMR), total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), were measured in 108 locations (0-30 cm depth). The MDS was determined by the principal component analysis. A digital soil mapping (DSM) method, more specifically the random forest technique, was applied to produce the SQI maps. The maximum and minimum values of the SQIs were obtained in the natural forest (NF) and the dry farming (DR) land uses, respectively. The results indicated that both methods (i.e., TDS and MDS) properly could describe SQ in this area but MDS can be recommended as an appropriate method because it was able to classify the SQ using a lower number of the soil properties without losing information to SQ assessment. In addition, NF and the more-than-ten-year-old commercial garden (G10 +) land uses had the highest proportions of SQ grades I and II, respectively. Conversely, DR and the lessthan-ten-year-old commercial gardens (G10) land uses had the highest proportions of the SQ grade V (very low quality) among the six SQIs. The findings indicated that the L scoring system had higher agreement values for all SQIs compared to the NL scoring system, and also SQI(n) (R-2 = 0.874) could provide a better estimation compared to the SQI(a) (R-2 = 0.864) and SQI(w) (R-2 = 0.865). The spatial distribution of the SQ grades using DSM indicated that the land use conversion could decrease SQIs, suggesting that close attention should be paid to the sustainable use of the agricultural lands to increase the SQ.

J	Zhou, YY; Cheng, G; Jiang, SQ; Dai, M				Zhou, Yuyang; Cheng, Guang; Jiang, Shanqing; Dai, Mian			Building an efficient intrusion detection system based on feature selection and ensemble classifier	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Cyber security; Intrusion detection system; Data mining; Feature selection; Ensemble classifier	ALGORITHM; FOREST; MODEL; ATTACKS; IDS	Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of extensively used techniques in a network topology to safeguard the integrity and availability of sensitive assets in the protected systems. Although many supervised and unsupervised learning approaches from the field of machine learning have been used to increase the efficacy of IDSs, it is still a problem for existing intrusion detection algorithms to achieve good performance. First, lots of redundant and irrelevant data in high-dimensional datasets interfere with the classification process of an IDS. Second, an individual classifier may not perform well in the detection of each type of attacks. Third, many models are built for stale datasets, making them less adaptable for novel attacks. Thus, we propose a new intrusion detection framework in this paper, and this framework is based on the feature selection and ensemble learning techniques. In the first step, a heuristic algorithm called CFS-BA is proposed for dimensionality reduction, which selects the optimal subset based on the correlation between features. Then, we introduce an ensemble approach that combines C4.5, Random Forest (RF), and Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) algorithms. Finally, voting technique is used to combine the probability distributions of the base learners for attack recognition. The experimental results, using NSL-KDD, AWID, and CIC-IDS2017 datasets, reveal that the proposed CFS-BA-Ensemble method is able to exhibit better performance than other related and state of the art approaches under several metrics.

It is a serious form of cancer caused by uncontrollable brain cell growth inside the skull. Tumor cells are notoriously difficult to classify due to their heterogeneity. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely used machine learning algorithm for visual learning and brain tumor recognition. This study proposed a CNN-based dense EfficientNet using min-max normalization to classify 3260 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance images into four categories (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor). The developed network is a variant of EfficientNet with dense and drop-out layers added. Similarly, the authors combined data augmentation with min-max normalization to increase the contrast of tumor cells. The benefit of the dense CNN model is that it can accurately categorize a limited database of pictures. As a result, the proposed approach provides exceptional overall performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model was 99.97% accurate during training and 98.78% accurate during testing. With high accuracy and a favorable F1 score, the newly designed EfficientNet CNN architecture can be a useful decision-making tool in the study of brain tumor diagnostic tests.

We found that mice exhibit stereotyped facial expressions in response to emotionally salient events, as well as upon targeted manipulations in emotion-relevant neuronal circuits. Facial expressions were classified into distinct categories using machine learning and reflected the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus encountered under different homeostatic or affective conditions. Facial expressions revealed emotion features such as intensity, valence, and persistence. Two-photon imaging uncovered insular cortical neuron activity that correlated with specific facial expressions and may encode distinct emotions. Facial expressions thus provide a means to infer emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice.

J	Aljarah, I; Faris, H; Mirjalili, S				Aljarah, Ibrahim; Faris, Hossam; Mirjalili, Seyedali			Optimizing connection weights in neural networks using the whale optimization algorithm	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Optimization; Whale optimization algorithm; WOA; Multilayer perceptron; MLP; Training neural network; Evolutionary algorithm	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; BACKPROPAGATION; IMPLEMENTATION	The learning process of artificial neural networks is considered as one of the most difficult challenges in machine learning and has attracted many researchers recently. The main difficulty of training a neural network is the nonlinear nature and the unknown best set of main controlling parameters (weights and biases). The main disadvantages of the conventional training algorithms are local optima stagnation and slow convergence speed. This makes stochastic optimization algorithm reliable alternative to alleviate these drawbacks. This work proposes a new training algorithm based on the recently proposed whale optimization algorithm (WOA). It has been proved that this algorithm is able to solve a wide range of optimization problems and outperform the current algorithms. This motivated our attempts to benchmark its performance in training feedforward neural networks. For the first time in the literature, a set of 20 datasets with different levels of difficulty are chosen to test the proposed WOA-based trainer. The results are verified by comparisons with back-propagation algorithm and six evolutionary techniques. The qualitative and quantitative results prove that the proposed trainer is able to outperform the current algorithms on the majority of datasets in terms of both local optima avoidance and convergence speed.

As one of the most important components in the cell, miRNAs play a growing important role in various essential and important biological processes. For the recent few decades, amounts of experimental methods and computational models have been designed and implemented to identify novel miRNA-disease associations. In this review, the functions of miRNAs, miRNA-target interactions, miRNA-disease associations and some important publicly available miRNA-related databases were discussed in detail. Specially, considering the important fact that an increasing number of miRNA-disease associations have been experimentally confirmed, we selected five important miRNA-related human diseases and five crucial disease-related miRNAs and provided corresponding introductions. Identifying disease-related miRNAs has become an important goal of biomedical research, which will accelerate the understanding of disease pathogenesis at the molecular level and molecular tools design for disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Computational models have become an important means for novel miRNA-disease association identification, which could select the most promising miRNA-disease pairs for experimental validation and significantly reduce the time and cost of the biological experiments. Here, we reviewed 20 state-of-the-art computational models of predicting miRNA-disease associations from different perspectives. Finally, we summarized four important factors for the difficulties of predicting potential disease-related miRNAs, the framework of constructing powerful computational models to predict potential miRNA-disease associations including five feasible and important research schemas, and future directions for further development of computational models.

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.

In this study, a novel hybrid integration approach of Fisher's linear discriminant function (FLDA) with rotation forest (RFLDA) and bagging (BFLDA) ensembles was used for groundwater potential assessment at the Ningtiaota area in Shaanxi, China. A spatial database with 66 groundwater spring locations and 14 groundwater spring contributing factors was prepared; these factors were elevation, aspect, slope, plan and profile curvatures, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance to roads and streams, land use, lithology, soil and normalized difference vegetation index. The classifier attribute evaluation method based on the FLDA model was implemented to test the predictive competence of the mentioned contributing factors. The area under curve, confidence interval at 95%, standard error, Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare and validate the success and prediction competence of the three applied models. According to the achieved results, the BFLDA model showed the most prediction competence, followed by the RFLDA and FLDA models, respectively. The resulting groundwater spring potential maps can be used for groundwater development plans and land use planning.

J	Ribeiro, MHD; Coelho, LD				Dal Molin Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique; Coelho, Leandro dos Santos			Ensemble approach based on bagging, boosting and stacking for short-term prediction in agribusiness time series	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Bagging; Boosting; Agricultural commodity; Ensemble regression; Stacking; Time series	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; GOLD-PRICE FLUCTUATIONS; MODELS; SYSTEM; METHODOLOGY; CONSUMPTION; VOLATILITY; ALGORITHMS; PARAMETERS	The investigation of the accuracy of methods employed to forecast agricultural commodities prices is an important area of study. In this context, the development of effective models is necessary. Regression ensembles can be used for this purpose. An ensemble is a set of combined models which act together to forecast a response variable with lower error. Faced with this, the general contribution of this work is to explore the predictive capability of regression ensembles by comparing ensembles among themselves, as well as with approaches that consider a single model (reference models) in the agribusiness area to forecast prices one month ahead. In this aspect, monthly time series referring to the price paid to producers in the state of Parana, Brazil for a 60 kg bag of soybean (case study 1) and wheat (case study 2) are used. The ensembles bagging (random forests - RF), boosting (gradient boosting machine - GBM and extreme gradient boosting machine - XGB), and stacking (STACK) are adopted. The support vector machine for regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) are adopted as reference models. Performance measures such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) are used for models comparison. Friedman and Wilcoxon signed rank tests are applied to evaluate the models' absolute percentage errors (APE). From the comparison of test set results, MAPE lower than 1% is observed for the best ensemble approaches. In this context, the XGB/STACK (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-KNN-XGB-SVR) and RF models showed better performance for short-term forecasting tasks for case studies 1 and 2, respectively. Better APE (statistically smaller) is observed for XGB/STACK and RF in relation to reference models. Besides that, approaches based on boosting are consistent, providing good results in both case studies. Alongside, a rank according to the performances is: XGB, GBM, RF, STACK, MLP, SVR and KNN. It can be concluded that the ensemble approach presents statistically significant gains, reducing prediction errors for the price series studied. The use of ensembles is recommended to forecast agricultural commodities prices one month ahead, since a more assertive performance is observed, which allows to increase the accuracy of the constructed model and reduce decision-making risk.

Both the needs and limitations have changed in the twenty-first, and so has the methodology. Large-scale prediction algorithms-neural nets, deep learning, boosting, support vector machines, random forests-have achieved star status in the popular press. They are recognizable as heirs to the regression tradition, but ones carried out at enormous scale and on titanic datasets. How do these algorithms compare with standard regression techniques such as ordinary least squares or logistic regression? Several key discrepancies will be examined, centering on the differences between prediction and estimation or prediction and attribution (significance testing). Most of the discussion is carried out through small numerical examples.

While it is possible to simulate with a classical computer, the time and memory requirements generally scale exponentially with the system size. Conversely, quantum computers can efficiently simulate quantum systems, but not non-unitary imaginary time evolution. We propose a variational algorithm for simulating imaginary time evolution on a hybrid quantum computer. We use this algorithm to find the ground-state energy of many-particle systems; specifically molecular hydrogen and lithium hydride, finding the ground state with high probability. Our method can also be applied to general optimisation problems and quantum machine learning. As our algorithm is hybrid, suitable for error mitigation and can exploit shallow quantum circuits, it can be implemented with current quantum computers.

Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sus- tainability.

J	Hidalgo, CA				Hidalgo, Cesar A.			Economic complexity theory and applications	NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS			English	Review							GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION; GROWTH EVIDENCE; RESEARCH SPACE; KNOWLEDGE; RELATEDNESS; INNOVATION; INDUSTRY; MOBILITY; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION	Keywords Economic complexity involves the use of machine learning and network techniques to predict and explain the economic trajectories of countries, cities and regions. Measures of relatedness - which estimate the affinity between economies and activities - anticipate changes in specialization patterns and explain labour market outcomes, such as income loss and unemployment. Economic complexity measures are reduced-dimensionality representations of specialization matrices that explain the geography of hundreds of economic activities. Measures of economic complexity explain and predict international and regional variations in income, economic growth, income inequality, gender inequality and greenhouse emissions. Economic complexity methods have been validated by studies at multiple geographic scales (from countries to cities) and a variety of economic activities (products, industries, occupations, patents, research papers). Relatedness metrics can be unpacked into multiple channels (such as industry, occupation and location-specific knowledge) to understand the drivers of regional diversification. Economic complexity methods predict changes in the geography of economic activities and explain differences in economic growth, inequality, greenhouse emissions and labour market outcomes. This Review summarizes a decade of research on economic complexity and its applications. Economic complexity methods have become popular tools in economic geography, international development and innovation studies. Here, I review economic complexity theory and applications, with a particular focus on two streams of literature: the literature on relatedness, which focuses on the evolution of specialization patterns, and the literature on metrics of economic complexity, which uses dimensionality reduction techniques to create metrics of economic sophistication that are predictive of variations in income, economic growth, emissions and income inequality.

Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) can help operators timely detect and diagnose abnormal situations, and take right actions to avoid adverse consequences. However, FDD is still far from widely practical applications. Over the past few years, deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has shown excellent performance on machine-learning tasks. In this paper, a fault diagnosis method based on a DCNN model consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout, fully connected layers is proposed for chemical process fault diagnosis. The benchmark Tennessee Eastman (TE) process is utilized to verify the outstanding performance of the fault diagnosis method. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications, such as enhancer analysis and genome-wide chromatin state annotation, enables systematic analysis of how the epigenomic landscape contributes to cell identity, development, lineage specification, and disease. In this review, we first present a typical ChIP-seq analysis workflow, from quality assessment to chromatin-state annotation. We focus on practical, rather than theoretical, approaches for biological studies. Next, we outline various advanced ChIP-seq applications and introduce several state-of-the-art methods, including prediction of gene expression level and chromatin loops from epigenome data and data imputation.

In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that a PAF-only refinement rather than both PAF and body part location refinement results in a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an internal annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually. This work has culminated in the release of Open Pose, the first open-source realtime system for multi-person 2D pose detection, including body, foot, hand, and facial keypoints.

Here we review the treatment approach and the evidence base, arguing that ICBT can be viewed as a vehicle for innovation. ICBT has been developed and tested for several psychiatric and somatic conditions, and direct comparative studies suggest that therapist-guided ICBT is more effective than a waiting list for anxiety disorders and depression, and tends to be as effective as face-to-face CBT. Studies on the possible harmful effects of ICBT are also reviewed: a significant minority of people do experience negative effects, although rates of deterioration appear similar to those reported for face-to-face treatments and lower than for control conditions. We further review studies on change mechanisms and conclude that few, if any, consistent moderators and mediators of change have been identified. A recent trend to focus on knowledge acquisition is considered, and a discussion on the possibilities and hurdles of implementing ICBT is presented. The latter includes findings suggesting that attitudes toward ICBT may not be as positive as when using modern information technology as an adjunct to face-to-face therapy (i.e., blended treatment). Finally, we discuss future directions, including the role played by technology and machine learning, blended treatment, adaptation of treatment for minorities and non-Western settings, other therapeutic approaches than ICBT (including Internet-delivered psychodynamic and interpersonal psychotherapy as well as acceptance and commitment therapy), emerging regulations, and the importance of reporting failed trials.

The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various EEG decoding algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with targeted patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems with EEG-based BCI systems are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed.

For full assistance of radiologists and better analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multi-grade classification of brain tumor is an essential procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-grade brain tumor classification system. Firstly, tumor regions from an MR image are segmented using a deep learning technique. Secondly, extensive data augmentation is employed to effectively train the proposed system, avoiding the lack of data problem when dealing with MRI for multi-grade brain tumor classification. Finally, a pre-trained CNN model is fine-tuned using augmented data for brain tumor grade classification. The proposed system is experimentally evaluated on both augmented and original data and results show its convincing performance compared to existing methods. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Color fundus photography (CFP) is the most cost-effective imaging modality to screen for retinal disorders. However, its application to glaucoma has been limited to the computation of a few related biomarkers such as the vertical cup-to-disc ratio. Deep learning approaches, although widely applied for medical image analysis, have not been extensively used for glaucoma assessment due to the limited size of the available data sets. Furthermore, the lack of a standardize benchmark strategy makes difficult to compare existing methods in a uniform way. In order to overcome these issues we set up the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge, REFUGE (https://refuge.grand-challenge.org), held in conjunction with MIC-CAI 2018. The challenge consisted of two primary tasks, namely optic disc/cup segmentation and glaucoma classification. As part of REFUGE, we have publicly released a data set of 1200 fundus images with ground truth segmentations and clinical glaucoma labels, currently the largest existing one. We have also built an evaluation framework to ease and ensure fairness in the comparison of different models, encouraging the development of novel techniques in the field. 12 teams qualified and participated in the online challenge. This paper summarizes their methods and analyzes their corresponding results. In particular, we observed that two of the top-ranked teams outperformed two human experts in the glaucoma classification task. Furthermore, the segmentation results were in general consistent with the ground truth annotations, with complementary outcomes that can be further exploited by ensembling the results.

Accordingly, mobile edge computing (MEC) came into picture as novel emerging solutions to overcome many cloud computing issues. In this contemporary technology, the computation server and processing units are nearby edge servers to reduce latency, increase the network bandwidth and reduce energy consumption in user devices. These features can integrate with several domains such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence (AI), federated learning (FL) and fog computing, etc., to make the system more robust, elastic, efficient, and accurate. Regardless of the advantages, MEC faces several challenges, including security and privacy, deployment protocols, and offloading management. Although, various studies have been found tuning MEC to solve such challenges, the literature provide more ideas for smart developments toward applications particularly using FL and AI. Most researches miss combining interesting aspects of MEC, such as machine learning and deep learning approaches limiting works to only single aspect. Thus, a literature work is needed to focus on all the aspects of MEC together. This study aims to present a comprehensive survey on MEC by providing all necessary information, including network architecture, advantages, objectives, access technologies, deployment templates, characteristics, and many more. The work is not limited to only MEC background but also covers the AI and FL approaches used within MEC, allowing mobile phones to learn a shared predictive model collaboratively. This survey also provides information regarding security and privacy challenges as well as attacks on MEC and their solutions. The applications of MEC illustrate different sectors where MEC is applicable further highlighting open issues and challenges to be investigated.

J	Abdel-Basset, M; Chang, V; Mohamed, R				Abdel-Basset, Mohamed; Chang, Victor; Mohamed, Reda			HSMA_WOA: A hybrid novel Slime mould algorithm with whale optimization algorithm for tackling the image segmentation problem of chest X-ray images	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Image segmentation problem; Slime mould algorithm (SMA); Whale optimization algorithm; Kapur's entropy; X-ray images; COVID-19	ENTROPY	Recently, a novel virus called COVID-19 has pervasive worldwide, starting from China and moving to all the world to eliminate a lot of persons. Many attempts have been experimented to identify the infection with COVID-19. The X-ray images were one of the attempts to detect the influence of COVID-19 on the infected persons from involving those experiments. According to the X-ray analysis, bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities can be caused by COVID-19 - sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution. But unfortunately, the specification or if the person infected with COVID-19 or not is so hard under the X-ray images. X-ray images could be classified using the machine learning techniques to specify if the person infected severely, mild, or not infected. To improve the classification accuracy of the machine learning, the region of interest within the image that contains the features of COVID-19 must be extracted. This problem is called the image segmentation problem (ISP). Many techniques have been proposed to overcome ISP. The most commonly used technique due to its simplicity, speed, and accuracy are threshold-based segmentation. This paper proposes a new hybrid approach based on the thresholding technique to overcome ISP for COVID-19 chest X-ray images by integrating a novel meta-heuristic algorithm known as a slime mold algorithm (SMA) with the whale optimization algorithm to maximize the Kapur's entropy. The performance of integrated SMA has been evaluated on 12 chest X-ray images with threshold levels up to 30 and compared with five algorithms: Lshade algorithm, whale optimization algorithm (WOA), FireFly algorithm (FFA), Harris-hawks algorithm (HHA), salp swarm algorithms (SSA), and the standard SMA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms SMA under Kapur's entropy for all the metrics used and the standard SMA could perform better than the other algorithms in the comparison under all the metrics.

Our study used an ensemble model that integrated multiple machine learning algorithms and predictor variables to estimate daily PM(2.5 )at a resolution of 1 km x 1 km across the contiguous United States. We used a generalized additive model that accounted for geographic difference to combine PM2.5 estimates from neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting. The three machine learning algorithms were based on multiple predictor variables, including satellite data, meteorological variables, land-use variables, elevation, chemical transport model predictions, several reanalysis datasets, and others. The model training results from 2000 to 2015 indicated good model performance with a 10-fold cross-validated R-2 of 0.86 for daily PM2.5 predictions. For annual PM2.5 estimates, the cross-validated R-2 was 0.89. Our model demonstrated good performance up to 60 mu g/m(3). Using trained PM2.5 model and predictor variables, we predicted daily PM2.5 from 2000 to 2015 at every 1 km x 1 km grid cell in the contiguous United States. We also used localized land-use variables within 1 km x 1 km grids to downscale PM2.5 predictions to 100 m x 100 m grid cells. To characterize uncertainty, we used meteorological variables, land-use variables, and elevation to model the monthly standard deviation of the difference between daily monitored and predicted PM2.5 for every 1 km x 1 km grid cell. This PM2.5 prediction dataset, including the downscaled and uncertainty predictions, allows epidemiologists to accurately estimate the adverse health effect of PM2.5. Compared with model performance of individual base learners, an ensemble model would achieve a better overall estimation. It is worth exploring other ensemble model formats to synthesize estimations from different models or from different groups to improve overall performance.

J	Niu, MT; Lin, Y; Zou, Q				Niu, Mengting; Lin, Yuan; Zou, Quan			sgRNACNN: identifying sgRNA on-target activity in four crops using ensembles of convolutional neural networks	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						sgRNA high on-target activity; One-hot encoding; k-mer; Convolutional neural networks	WEB SERVER; IDENTIFICATION; SEQUENCE; PREDICTION; GENERATION; ENHANCERS; SOFTWARE; DELIVERY; MACHINE; DISEASE	Key message We proposed an ensemble convolutional neural network model to identify sgRNA high on-target activity in four crops and we used one-hot encoding and k-mers for sequence encoding. As an important component of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, single-guide RNA (sgRNA) plays an important role in gene redirection and editing. sgRNA has played an important role in the improvement of agronomic species, but there is a lack of effective bioinformatics tools to identify the activity of sgRNA in agronomic species. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method based on machine learning to identify sgRNA high on-target activity. In this work, we proposed a simple convolutional neural network method to identify sgRNA high on-target activity. Our study used one-hot encoding and k-mers for sequence data conversion and a voting algorithm for constructing the convolutional neural network ensemble model sgRNACNN for the prediction of sgRNA activity. The ensemble model sgRNACNN was used for predictions in four crops: Glycine max, Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and Triticum aestivum. The accuracy rates of the four crops in the sgRNACNN model were 82.43%, 80.33%, 78.25% and 87.49%, respectively. The experimental results showed that sgRNACNN realizes the identification of high on-target activity sgRNA of agronomic data and can meet the demands of sgRNA activity prediction in agronomy to a certain extent. These results have certain significance for guiding crop gene editing and academic research.

Natl COVID Cohor	Clinical Characterization and Prediction of Clinical Severity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among US Adults Using Data From the US National COVID Cohort Collaborative	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article								IMPORTANCE The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository that is the largest, most representative COVID-19 cohort to date. This multicenter data set can support robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and inform clinical care and policy. OBJECTIVES To evaluate COVID-19 severity and risk factors over time and assess the use of machine learning to predict clinical severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a retrospective cohort study of 1 926 526 US adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction >99% or antigen <1%) and adult patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection who served as controls from 34 medical centers nationwide between January 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020, patients were stratified using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographic characteristics. Differences between groups over time were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Random forest and XGBoost models were used to predict severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilatory support, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patient demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity using the World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS The cohort included 174 568 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2% female) and 1 133 848 adult controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1% female). Of the 174 568 adults with SARS-CoV-2, 32 472 (18.6%) were hospitalized, and 6565 (20.2%) of those had a severe clinical course (invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death, or discharge to hospice). Of the hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March to April 2020 to 8.6% in September to October 2020 (P = .002 for monthly trend). Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, this study predicted a severe clinical course using random forest and XGBoost models (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87 for both) that were stable over time. The factor most strongly associated with clinical severity was pH; this result was consistent across machine learning methods. In a separate multivariable logistic regression model built for inference, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04), male sex (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.51-1.69), liver disease (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34), dementia (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13-1.41), African American (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20) and Asian (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.57) race, and obesity (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.27-1.46) were independently associated with higher clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study found that COVID-19 mortality decreased over time during 2020 and that patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were associated with higher clinical severity. The machine learning models accurately predicted ultimate clinical severity using commonly collected clinical data from the first 24 hours of a hospital admission.

J	Drautz, R				Drautz, Ralf			Atomic cluster expansion for accurate and transferable interatomic potentials	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							TIGHT-BINDING; ELECTRON-GAS; ORDER; ALGORITHM; SILICON; STATES	The atomic cluster expansion is developed as a complete descriptor of the local atomic environment, including multicomponent materials, and its relation to a number of other descriptors and potentials is discussed. The effort for evaluating the atomic cluster expansion is shown to scale linearly with the number of neighbors, irrespective of the order of the expansion. Application to small Cu clusters demonstrates smooth convergence of the atomic cluster expansion to meV accuracy. By introducing nonlinear functions of the atomic cluster expansion an interatomic potential is obtained that is comparable in accuracy to state-of-the-art machine learning potentials. Because of the efficient convergence of the atomic cluster expansion relevant subspaces can be sampled uniformly and exhaustively. This is demonstrated by testing against a large database of density functional theory calculations for copper.

J	Tong, W; Chen, WT; Han, W; Li, XJ; Wang, LZ				Tong, Wei; Chen, Weitao; Han, Wei; Li, Xianju; Wang, Lizhe			Channel-Attention-Based DenseNet Network for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Remote sensing; Smoothing methods; Machine learning; Semantics; Traffic control; Attention mechanism; deep learning; DenseNet; remote sensing; scene classification	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FEATURES; MODEL	Remote sensing image scene classification has been widely applied and has attracted increasing attention. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in scene classification. However, scene images have complex semantic relationships between multiscale ground objects, and the traditional stacked network structure lacks the ability to effectively extract multiscale and key features, resulting in limited feature representation capabilities. By simulating the way that humans understand and perceive images, attention mechanisms can be beneficial for quickly and accurately acquiring key features. In our study, we propose a channel-attention-based DenseNet (CAD) network for scene classification. First, the lightweight DenseNet121 is selected as the backbone for the spatial relationship between multiscale ground objects. In the spatial domain, densely connected CNN layers can extract spatial features at multiple scales and correlate with each other. Second, in the channel domain, a channel attention mechanism is introduced to strengthen the weights of the important feature channels adaptively and to suppress the secondary feature channels. Third, the cross-entropy loss function based on label smoothing is used to reduce the impact of interclass similarity upon feature representations. The proposed CAD network is evaluated on three public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the CAD network can achieve performance comparable to those of other state-of-the-art methods. The visualization through the Grad-CAM ++ algorithm also reflects the effectiveness of channel attention and the powerful feature representation capabilities of the CAD network.

Group sparsity is used to ensure parsimonious representations of observed dynamics in the form of a parametric PDE, while also allowing the coefficients to have arbitrary time series, or spatial dependence. This work builds on previous methods for the identification of constant coefficient PDEs, expanding the field to include a new class of equations which until now have eluded machine learning based identification methods. We show that group sequentially thresholded ridge regression outperforms group LASSO in identifying the fewest terms in the PDE along with their parametric dependency. The method is demonstrated on four canonical models with and without the introduction of noise.	[Rudy, Samuel; Kutz, J.

We find novel versions of the Hermite-Hadamard and Ostrowski type inequalities for the n-polynomial s-type convex functions in the frame of fractional calculus. Taking into account the new concept, we derive some generalizations that capture novel results under investigation. We present two different general techniques, for the functions whose first and second derivatives in absolute value at certain powers are n-polynomial s-type convex functions by employing K-fractional integral operators have yielded intriguing results. Applications and motivations of presented results are briefly discussed that generate novel variants related to quadrature rules that will be helpful for in-depth investigation in fractal theory, optimization and machine learning.

Or are they an opportunity, and, if so, how would news recommenders need to be designed to advance values and goals that we consider essential in a democratic society? These are central questions in the ongoing academic and policy debate about the likely implications of data analytics and machine learning for the democratic role of the media and the shift from traditional mass-media modes of distribution towards more personalised news and platforms Building on democratic theory and the growing body of literature about the digital turn in journalism, this article offers a conceptual framework for assessing the threats and opportunities around the democratic role of news recommenders, and develops a typology of different 'democratic recommenders'.

As vehicular connectivity soars, and new on-road mobile applications and technologies emerge, VANETs are generating an ever-increasing amount of data, requiring fast and reliable transmissions through VANETs. On the other hand, a variety of VANETs related data can be analyzed and utilized to improve the performance of VANETs. In this article, we first review VANETs technologies to efficiently and reliably transmit big data. Then, the methods employing big data for studying VANETs characteristics and improving VANETs performance are discussed.

Because of the fundamental differences in their formulations and coding schemes, these two approaches rely on distinct and incompatible platforms(2-8), retarding the development of AGI. A general platform that could support the prevailing computer-science-based artificial neural networks as well as neuroscience-inspired models and algorithms is highly desirable. Here we present the Tianjic chip, which integrates the two approaches to provide a hybrid, synergistic platform. The Tianjic chip adopts a many-core architecture, reconfigurable building blocks and a streamlined dataflow with hybrid coding schemes, and can not only accommodate computer-science-based machine-learning algorithms, but also easily implement brain-inspired circuits and several coding schemes. Using just one chip, we demonstrate the simultaneous processing of versatile algorithms and models in an unmanned bicycle system, realizing real-time object detection, tracking, voice control, obstacle avoidance and balance control. Our study is expected to stimulate AGI development by paving the way to more generalized hardware platforms.

Conventional approaches for BBB permeability measurement are expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive. BBB permeability is associated with diverse chemical properties of compounds. However, BBB permeability prediction models have been developed using small datasets and limited features, which are usually not practical due to their low coverage of chemical diversity of compounds. Aim of this study is to develop a BBB permeability prediction model using a large dataset for practical applications. This model can be used for facilitated compound screening in the early stage of brain drug discovery. Results: A dataset of 7162 compounds with BBB permeability (5453 BBB+ and 1709 BBB-) was compiled from the literature, where BBB+ and BBB- denote BBB-permeable and non-permeable compounds, respectively. We trained a machine learning model based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm and achieved an overall accuracy of 89%, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, specificity of 0.77 and sensitivity of 0.93, when 10-fold cross-validation was performed. The model was further evaluated using 74 central nerve system compounds (39 BBB+ and 35 BBB-) obtained from the literature and showed an accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 0.94. Our model outperforms over existing BBB permeability prediction models.

J	Yuan, ZZ; He, K; Yang, Y				Yuan, Zhenzhou; He, Kun; Yang, Yang			A Roadway Safety Sustainable Approach: Modeling for Real-Time Traffic Crash with Limited Data and Its Reliability Verification	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							INJURY-SEVERITY; ORDERED PROBIT; HETEROGENEITY; FREQUENCY; TOBIT	With the development of freeway system informatization, it is easier to obtain the traffic flow data of freeway, which are widely used to study the relationship between traffic flow state and traffic safety. However, as the development degree of the freeway system is different in different regions, the sample size of traffic data collected in some regions is insufficient, and the precision of data is relatively low. In order to study the influence of limited data on the real-time freeway traffic crash risk modeling, three data sets including high precision data, small sample data, and low precision data were considered. Firstly, Bayesian Logistic regression was used to identify and predict the risk of three data sets. Secondly, based on the Bayesian updating method, the migration test towards high and low precision data sets was established. Finally, the applicability of machine learning and statistical methods to low precision data set was compared. The results show that the prediction performance of Bayesian Logistic regression improves with the increasing of sample size. Bayesian Logistic regression can identify various significant risk factors when data sets are of different precision. Comparatively, the prediction performance of the support vector machine is better than that of Bayesian Logistic. In addition, Bayesian updating method can improve the prediction performance of the transplanted model.

Together with Landsat, these sensors provide the scientific community with a wide range of spatial, spectral, and temporal properties. This study compared and explored the synergistic use of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data in mapping land use and land cover (LULC) in rural Burkina Faso. Specifically, contribution of the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 in improving LULC mapping was examined. Three machine-learning algorithms - random forest, stochastic gradient boosting, and support vector machines - were employed to classify different data configurations. Classification of all Sentinel-2 bands as well as Sentinel-2 bands common to Landsat-8 produced an overall accuracy, that is 5% and 4% better than Landsat-8. The combination of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 red-edge bands resulted in a 4% accuracy improvement over that of Landsat-8. It was found that classification of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands alone produced better and comparable results to Landsat-8 and the other Sentinel-2 bands, respectively. Results of this study demonstrate the added value of the Sentinel-2 red-edge bands and encourage multi-sensoral approaches to LULC mapping in West Africa.

The accurate prediction of hemolytic peptides (HLPs) and its activity from the given peptides is one of the challenging tasks in immunoinformatics, which is essential for drug development and basic research. Although there are a few computational methods that have been proposed for this aspect, none of them are able to identify HLPs and their activities simultaneously. Results: In this study, we proposed a two-layer prediction framework, called HLPpred-Fuse, that can accurately and automatically predict both hemolytic peptides (HLPs or non-HLPs) as well as HLPs activity (high and low). More specifically, feature representation learning scheme was utilized to generate 54 probabilistic features by integrating six different machine learning classifiers and nine different sequence-based encodings. Consequently, the 54 probabilistic features were fused to provide sufficiently converged sequence information which was used as an input to extremely randomized tree for the development of two final prediction models which independently identify HLP and its activity. Performance comparisons over empirical cross-validation analysis, independent test and case study against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that HLPpred-Fuse consistently outperformed these methods in the identification of hemolytic activity.

Multiple networks provide rich information for inferring the function of genes or proteins. To extract functional patterns of genes based on multiple heterogeneous networks, network embedding-based methods, aiming to capture non-linear and low-dimensional feature representation based on network biology, have recently achieved remarkable performance in gene function prediction. However, existing methods do not consider the shared information among different networks during the feature learning process. Results: Taking the correlation among the networks into account, we design a novel semi-supervised autoencoder method to integrate multiple networks and generate a low-dimensional feature representation. Then we utilize a convolutional neural network based on the integrated feature embedding to annotate unlabeled gene functions. We test our method on both yeast and human datasets and compare with three state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. We not only provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the newly proposed algorithm but also provide a tool for extracting features of genes based on multiple networks, which can be used in the downstream machine learning task.

We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues. Single-cell methods record molecule expressions of cells in a given tissue, but understanding interactions between cells remains challenging. Here the authors show by applying systems biology and machine learning approaches that they can infer and analyze cell-cell communication networks in an easily interpretable way.

Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.

Accurate brain age prediction with lightweight deep neural networks	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Neuroimaging; Brain age prediction; Predictive analysis; Convolutional neural networks	PATTERNS; DISEASE	Deep learning has huge potential for accurate disease prediction with neuroimaging data, but the prediction performance is often limited by training-dataset size and computing memory requirements. To address this, we propose a deep convolutional neural network model, Simple Fully Convolutional Network (SFCN), for accurate prediction of brain age using Tl-weighted structural MRI data. Compared with other popular deep network architectures, SFCN has fewer parameters, so is more compatible with small dataset size and 3D volume data. The network architecture was combined with several techniques for boosting performance, including data augmentation, pre-training, model regularization, model ensemble and prediction bias correction. We compared our overall SFCN approach with several widely-used machine learning models. It achieved state-of-the-art performance in UK Biobank data (N = 14,503), with mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.14y in brain age prediction and 99.5% in sex classification. SFCN also won (both parts of) the 2019 Predictive Analysis Challenge for brain age prediction, involving 79 competing teams (N = 2,638, MAE = 2.90y). We describe here the details of our approach, and its optimisation and validation. Our approach can easily be generalised to other tasks using different image modalities, and is released on GitHub.

With its specific features, unlabeled EEG is not well addressed by conventional unsupervised time-series learning methods. In this article, we handle the problem of unlabeled EEG time-series clustering and propose a novel EEG clustering algorithm, that we call mwcEEGc. The idea is to map the EEG clustering to the maximum-weight clique (MWC) searching in an improved Frechet similarity-weighted EEG graph. The mwcEEGc considers the weights of both vertices and edges in the constructed EEG graph and clusters EEG based on their similarity weights instead of calculating the cluster centroids. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to cluster unlabeled EEG trials using MWC searching. The mwcEEGc achieves high-quality clusters with respect to intracluster compactness as well as intercluster scatter. We demonstrate the superiority of mwcEEGc over ten state-of-the-art unsupervised learning/clustering approaches by conducting detailed experimentations with the standard clustering validity criteria on 14 real-world brain EEG datasets. We also present that mwcEEGc satisfies the theoretical properties of clustering, such as richness, consistency, and order independence.

J	Sagheer, A; Kotb, M				Sagheer, Alaa; Kotb, Mostafa			Time series forecasting of petroleum production using deep LSTM recurrent networks	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Time series forecasting; Deep neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Long-short term memory; Petroleum production forecasting	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SELECTION	Time series forecasting (TSF) is the task of predicting future values of a given sequence using historical data. Recently, this task has attracted the attention of researchers in the area of machine learning to address the limitations of traditional forecasting methods, which are time-consuming and full of complexity. With the increasing availability of extensive amounts of historical data along with the need of performing accurate production forecasting, particularly a powerful forecasting technique infers the stochastic dependency between past and future values is highly needed. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach capable to address the limitations of traditional forecasting approaches and show accurate predictions. The proposed approach is a deep long-short term memory (DLSTM) architecture, as an extension of the traditional recurrent neural network. Genetic algorithm is applied in order to optimally configure DLSTM's optimum architecture. For evaluation purpose, two case studies from the petroleum industry domain are carried out using the production data of two actual oilfields. Toward a fair evaluation, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with several standard methods, either statistical or soft computing. Using different measurement criteria, the empirical results show that the proposed DLSTM model outperforms other standard approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hospitals cannot quickly provide treatment for chronic diseases for the elderly. This article discusses a mobile-medical-based system that uses effective data decision-making and wireless network communication to assist the elderly in implementing remote medical services and proposes a deep learning model-combined sparse autoencoder (CSAE) in the decision-making module. The model uses sparse autoencoders to process patient detection data and monitoring data collaboratively to achieve multisource data association and fusion. The prediction probability of diseases is obtained through deep neural networks and a classifier, and the best disease prediction sequence is output to realize the prediction and early warning of chronic diseases. In the experimental part, we compare CSAE with the other four machine learning classification algorithms in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results prove that CSAE is superior to other algorithms in the single-disease prediction, with the accuracy and specificity exceeding 85%, and the sensitivity not lower than 75%. When predicting multiple diseases, our proposed algorithm's performance is the most stable, with an accuracy higher than other algorithms by more than 10%.

J	Chen, YC; Zhu, XT; Zheng, WS; Lai, JH				Chen, Ying-Cong; Zhu, Xiatian; Zheng, Wei-Shi; Lai, Jian-Huang			Person Re-Identification by Camera Correlation Aware Feature Augmentation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Person re-identification; adaptive feature augmentation; view-specific transformation	ADAPTATION; NETWORK	The challenge of person re-identification (re-id) is to match individual images of the same person captured by different non-overlapping camera views against significant and unknown cross-view feature distortion. While a large number of distance metric/subspace learning models have been developed for re-id, the cross-view transformations they learned are view-generic and thus potentially less effective in quantifying the feature distortion inherent to each camera view. Learning view-specific feature transformations for re-id (i.e., view-specific re-id), an under-studied approach, becomes an alternative resort for this problem. In this work, we formulate a novel view-specific person re-identification framework from the feature augmentation point of view, called Camera coRrelation Aware Feature augmenTation (CRAFT). Specifically, CRAFT performs cross-view adaptation by automatically measuring camera correlation from cross-view visual data distribution and adaptively conducting feature augmentation to transform the original features into a new adaptive space. Through our augmentation framework, view-generic learning algorithms can be readily generalized to learn and optimize view-specific sub-models whilst simultaneously modelling view-generic discrimination information. Therefore, our framework not only inherits the strength of view-generic model learning but also provides an effective way to take into account view specific characteristics. Our CRAFT framework can be extended to jointly learn view-specific feature transformations for person re-id across a large network with more than two cameras, a largely under-investigated but realistic re-id setting. Additionally, we present a domain-generic deep person appearance representation which is designed particularly to be towards view invariant for facilitating cross-view adaptation by CRAFT. We conducted extensively comparative experiments to validate the superiority and advantages of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art competitors on contemporary challenging person re-id datasets.

Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing communications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an overview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.

Quantum Monte Carlo methods are a possible way out: they scale well for large molecules, they can be parallelized and their accuracy has, as yet, been only limited by the flexibility of the wavefunction ansatz used. Here we propose PauliNet, a deep-learning wavefunction ansatz that achieves nearly exact solutions of the electronic Schrodinger equation for molecules with up to 30 electrons. PauliNet has a multireference Hartree-Fock solution built in as a baseline, incorporates the physics of valid wavefunctions and is trained using variational quantum Monte Carlo. PauliNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art variational ansatzes for atoms, diatomic molecules and a strongly correlated linear H-10, and matches the accuracy of highly specialized quantum chemistry methods on the transition-state energy of cyclobutadiene, while being computationally efficient.

However, model uncertainties are still a major obstacle for the predictive capability of RANS simulations. This review examines both the parametric and structural uncertainties in turbulence models. We review recent literature on data-free (uncertainty propagation) and data-driven (statistical inference) approaches for quantifying and reducing model uncertainties in BANS simulations. Moreover, the fundamentals of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian inference are introduced in the context of BANS model uncertainty quantification. Finally, the literature on uncertainties in scale-resolving simulations is briefly reviewed with particular emphasis on large eddy simulations.

In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed.

J	McLean, G; Osei-Frimpong, K				McLean, Graeme; Osei-Frimpong, Kofi			Hey Alexa ... examine the variables influencing the use of artificial intelligent in-home voice assistants	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Voice assistants; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Technology adoption; Social presence; Uses and gratification theory	TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE; SOCIAL PRESENCE; GRATIFICATIONS; PERSONALITY; RESPONSES; ADOPTION; PRIVACY; TELEVISION	Artificial Intelligent (AI) In-home Voice Assistants have seen unprecedented growth. However, we have little understanding on the factors motivating individuals to use such devices. Given the unique characteristics of the technology, in the main hands free, controlled by voice, and the presentation of a voice user interface, the current technology adoption models are not comprehensive enough to explain the adoption of this new technology. Focusing on voice interactions, this research combines the theoretical foundations of U&GT with technology theories to gain a clearer understanding on the motivations for adopting and using in-home voice assistants. This research presents a conceptual model on the use of voice controlled technology and an empirical validation of the model through the use of Structural Equation Modelling with a sample of 724 in-home voice assistant users. The findings illustrate that individuals are motivated by the (1) utilitarian benefits, (2) symbolic benefits and (3) social benefits provided by voice assistants, the results found that hedonic benefits only motivate the use of in-home voice assistants in smaller households. Additionally, the research establishes a moderating role of perceived privacy risks in dampening and negatively influencing the use of in-home voice assistants.

These methods have been applied mostly using data from observed crashes, but this can create a problem in uncovering causality since individuals that are inherently riskier than the population as a whole may be over-represented in the data. In addition, when and where individuals choose to drive could affect data analyses that use real-time data since the population of observed drivers could change over time. This issue, the nature of the data, and the implementation target of the analysis imply that analysts must often tradeoff the predictive capability of the resulting analysis and its ability to uncover the underlying causal nature of crash-contributing factors. The selection of the data-analysis method is often made without full consideration of this tradeoff, even though there are potentially important implications for the development of safety countermeasures and policies. This paper provides a discussion of the issues involved in this tradeoff with regard to specific methodological alternatives and presents researchers with a better understanding of the trade-offs often being inherently made in their analysis.

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

Operational Research - the ubiquitous 'science of better' - plays a vital role in supporting this decision-making process. To that end, using data from the USA, India, UK, Germany, and Singapore up to mid-April 2020, we provide predictive analytics tools for forecasting and planning during a pandemic. We forecast COVID-19 growth rates with statistical, epidemiological, machine- and deep-learning models, and a new hybrid forecasting method based on nearest neighbors and clustering. We further model and forecast the excess demand for products and services during the pandemic using auxiliary data (google trends) and simulating governmental decisions (lockdown). Our empirical results can immediately help policymakers and planners make better decisions during the ongoing and future pandemics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data-driven predictive control for unlocking building energy flexibility: A review	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Review; Building energy flexibility; Data-driven; Machine learning; Model predictive control (MPC); Smart grid	OF-THE-ART; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DEMAND RESPONSE; THERMAL COMFORT; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY RESERVES; CONTROL STRATEGY; SMART BUILDINGS; COOLING SYSTEMS; MODEL-REDUCTION	Managing supply and demand in the electricity grid is becoming more challenging due to the increasing penetration of variable renewable energy sources. As significant end-use consumers, and through better grid integration, buildings are expected to play an expanding role in the future smart grid. Predictive control allows buildings to better harness available energy flexibility from the building passive thermal mass. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of the building stock, developing computationally tractable control-oriented models, which adequately represent the complex and nonlinear thermal-dynamics of individual buildings, is proving to be a major hurdle. Data-driven predictive control, coupled with the "Internet of Things", holds the promise for a scalable and transferrable approach, with data-driven models replacing traditional physics-based models. This review examines recent work utilising data-driven predictive control for demand side management application with a special focus on the nexus of model development and control integration, which to date, previous reviews have not addressed. Further topics examined include the practical requirements for harnessing passive thermal mass and the issue of feature selection. Current research gaps are outlined and future research pathways are suggested to identify the most promising data-driven predictive control techniques for grid integration of buildings.

We created a global prediction map of groundwater arsenic exceeding 10 micrograms per liter using a random forest machine-learning model based on 11 geospatial environmental parameters and more than 50,000 aggregated data points of measured groundwater arsenic concentration. Our global prediction map includes known arsenic-affected areas and previously undocumented areas of concern. By combining the global arsenic prediction model with household groundwater-usage statistics, we estimate that 94 million to 220 million people are potentially exposed to high arsenic concentrations in groundwater, the vast majority (94%) being in Asia. Because groundwater is increasingly used to support growing populations and buffer against water scarcity due to changing climate, this work is important to raise awareness, identify areas for safe wells, and help prioritize testing.

This paper aims to list and examine the magnitude and significance of individual difference in the preferred/neutral/comfort temperature through reviewing previous climate chamber and field studies. Causal factors for individual differences are investigated, including sex, age and etc. There is no clear and consistent conclusions as to the significance and size of inter-group differences in thermal comfort (between females and males, or the young and the old). To address the issue of individual difference, a paradigm shift from centralized to personalized air condition is on the way with the following three steps: first, collecting individual physiological and psychological response; second, predict individual comfort with machine learning algorithms; and third, accommodating individual difference with Personalized Comfort Systems.

J	Luo, LQ; Li, HM; Wang, JZ; Hu, JC				Luo, Liangqing; Li, Hongmin; Wang, Jianzhou; Hu, Juncheng			Design of a combined wind speed forecasting system based on decomposition-ensemble and multi-objective optimization approach	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Combined forecasting system; Multi-objective optimization; Wind-speed forecasting; Volterra forecasting model	NEURAL-NETWORK; HYBRID MODEL; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; STRATEGY; MULTISTEP; SELECTION	Wind-speed forecasting plays an important role in the efficient utilization of wind energy. However, accurate and stable forecasting of wind-speed series is challenging, considering the nonlinearity and chaotic characteristics of wind. Moreover, the limitations of individual forecasting models are ignored, which invariably leads to poor forecasting precision. Therefore, here, a wind-speed forecasting system based on two types of machine learning approaches (decomposition-ensemble and multi-objective optimization) is proposed, which addresses the nonlinearity and chaotic characteristics of wind-speed series well. In this system, the advanced optimization algorithm and no negative constraint theory determine the weights of results decomposed and forecasted by the sub-models. An empirical study using 10 min and 30 min interval datasets shows that the combined forecasting system outperforms comparison models and has advantages for wind-speed forecasting.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Xai; Black-box; Ethics; Challenges; Transparency; Autonomy	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; ALGORITHM; HEALTH; BIAS	Our title alludes to the three Christmas ghosts encountered by Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, who guide Ebenezer through the past, present, and future of Christmas holiday events. Similarly, our article takes readers through a journey of the past, present, and future of medical AI. In doing so, we focus on the crux of modern machine learning: the reliance on powerful but intrinsically opaque models. When applied to the healthcare domain, these models fail to meet the needs for transparency that their clinician and patient end-users require. We review the implications of this failure, and argue that opaque models (1) lack quality assurance, (2) fail to elicit trust, and (3) restrict physician-patient dialogue. We then discuss how upholding transparency in all aspects of model design and model validation can help ensure the reliability and success of medical AI.

J	Chang, SS; Wen, CF; Yao, JC				Chang, Shih-Sen; Wen, Ching-Feng; Yao, Jen-Chih			Zero Point Problem of Accretive Operators in Banach Spaces	BULLETIN OF THE MALAYSIAN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES SOCIETY			English	Article						Accretive operator; Maximal monotone operator; Banach space; Splitting method; Forward-backward algorithm	STRONG-CONVERGENCE THEOREMS; MAXIMAL MONOTONE-OPERATORS; NONEXPANSIVE-MAPPINGS; ALGORITHMS; SUM	Splitting methods have recently received much attention due to the fact that many nonlinear problems arising in applied areas such as image recovery, signal processing and machine learning are mathematically modeled as a nonlinear operator equation and this operator is decomposed as the sum of two (possibly simpler) nonlinear operators. Most of the investigation on splitting methods is however carried out in the framework of Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we consider these methods in the setting of Banach spaces. We shall introduce a viscosity iterative forward-backward splitting method with errors to find zeros of the sum of two accretive operators in Banach spaces. We shall prove the strong convergence of the method under mild conditions. We also discuss applications of these methods to monotone variational inequalities, convex minimization problem and convexly constrained linear inverse problem.

The EEG signal contains information about the electrical activity of the brain. Traditionally, neurologists employ direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. This technique can be time-consuming, limited by technical artifact, provides variable results secondary to reader expertise level, and is limited in identifying abnormalities. Therefore, it is essential to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to automatically distinguish the class of these EEG signals using machine learning techniques. This is the first study to employ the convolutional neural network (CNN) for analysis of EEG signals. In this work, a 13-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm is implemented to detect normal, preictal, and seizure classes. The proposed technique achieved an accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 88.67%, 90.00% and 95.00%, respectively.	[Acharya, U.

STRATOS Initiative	Calibration: the Achilles heel of predictive analytics	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article						Calibration; Risk prediction models; Predictive analytics; Overfitting; Heterogeneity; Model performance	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS; OVARIAN-CANCER; VALIDATION; IMPACT; IVF	Background: The assessment of calibration performance of risk prediction models based on regression or more flexible machine learning algorithms receives little attention. Main text: Herein, we argue that this needs to change immediately because poorly calibrated algorithms can be misleading and potentially harmful for clinical decision-making. We summarize how to avoid poor calibration at algorithm development and how to assess calibration at algorithm validation, emphasizing balance between model complexity and the available sample size. At external validation, calibration curves require sufficiently large samples. Algorithm updating should be considered for appropriate support of clinical practice. Conclusion: Efforts are required to avoid poor calibration when developing prediction models, to evaluate calibration when validating models, and to update models when indicated. The ultimate aim is to optimize the utility of predictive analytics for shared decision-making and patient counseling.

Pertinent parameters, including the base liquid thermal conductivity, particle thermal conductivity, particle size, particle volume fraction, and temperature, have been shown to have significant but complex effects on thermal performance of nanofluids, which is commonly characterized by the thermal conductivity enhancement, E%. In this work, machine learning is used to develop the Gaussian process regression model to find statistical correlations between E% and aforementioned physical parameters among various types of nanofluids. Nearly 300 nanofluid samples, dispersions of metal and ceramic nanoparticles in water, ethylene glycol, and transformer oil, are explored for this purpose. The modeling approach demonstrates a high degree of accuracy and stability, contributing to efficient and low-cost estimations of E%. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The combination of these models with visual attention techniques can assist with the identification of the most representative parts of the data from a visual standpoint, obtained through more detailed filtering of the features extracted by the operational layers of the network. This is of significant interest for analyzing remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs), characterized by their very high spectral dimensionality. However, few efforts have been conducted in the literature in order to adapt visual attention methods to remotely sensed HSI data analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new visual attention-driven technique for the HSI classification. Specifically, we incorporate attention mechanisms to a ResNet in order to better characterize the spectral-spatial information contained in the data. Our newly proposed method calculates a mask that is applied to the features obtained by the network in order to identify the most desirable ones for classification purposes. Our experiments, conducted using four widely used HSI data sets, reveal that the proposed deep attention model provides competitive advantages in terms of classification accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Given the high computational demands of CNNs, custom hardware accelerators are vital for boosting their performance. The high energy efficiency, computing capabilities and reconfigurability of FPGA make it a promising platform for hardware acceleration of CNNs. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques for implementing and optimizing CNN algorithms on FPGA. We organize the works in several categories to bring out their similarities and differences. This paper is expected to be useful for researchers in the area of artificial intelligence, hardware architecture and system design.

Numerous imaging schemes exist for BT detection, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), generally utilized because of the better quality of images and the reality of depending on non-ionizing radiation. This paper proposes an approach to detect distinctive BT types using Gaussian Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) on two datasets. One of the datasets is used to classify tumors into pituitary, glioma, and meningioma. The other one separates the three grades of glioma, i.e., Grade-two, Grade-three, and Grade-four. These datasets have '233' and '73' victims with a total of '3064' and '516' images on T1-weighted complexity improved pictures for the first and second datasets, separately. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 99.8% and 97.14% for the two datasets. The experimental results highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach for BT multi-class categorization.

By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases(1,2), which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing(3-10), which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings(11-13) (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure-property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.

Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, screening or standard diagnostic noncontrast CT images were collected for 290 patients (mean age, 68 years; range, 18-92 years; 125 men [mean age, 67 years; range, 18-90 years] and 165 women [mean age, 68 years; range, 33-92 years]) from two institutions between 2007 and 2013. Histopathologic analysis was available for one nodule per patient. Corresponding nodule of interest was identified on axial CT images by a radiologist with manual annotation. Nodule shape, wavelet (Gabor), and texture-based (Haralick and Laws energy) features were extracted from intra- and perinodular regions. Features were pruned to train machine learning classifiers with 145 patients. In a test set of 145 patients, classifier results were compared against a convolutional neural network (CNN) and diagnostic readings of two radiologists. Results: Support vector machine classifier with intranodular radiomic features achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 on the test set. Combining radiomics of intranodular with perinodular regions improved the AUC to 0.80. On the same test set, CNN resulted in an AUC of 0.76. Radiologist readers achieved AUCs of 0.61 and 0.60, respectively. Conclusion: Radiomic features from intranodular and perinodular regions of nodules can distinguish non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas from benign granulomas at noncontrast CT.

L.; Chan, Garnet Kin-Lic			Determining eigenstates and thermal states on a quantum computer using quantum imaginary time evolution	NATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							COMPUTATION	The accurate computation of Hamiltonian ground, excited and thermal states on quantum computers stands to impact many problems in the physical and computer sciences, from quantum simulation to machine learning. Given the challenges posed in constructing large-scale quantum computers, these tasks should be carried out in a resource-efficient way. In this regard, existing techniques based on phase estimation or variational algorithms display potential disadvantages; phase estimation requires deep circuits with ancillae, that are hard to execute reliably without error correction, while variational algorithms, while flexible with respect to circuit depth, entail additional high-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, which are analogues of classical algorithms for finding ground and excited states. Compared with their classical counterparts, they require exponentially less space and time per iteration, and can be implemented without deep circuits and ancillae, or high-dimensional optimization. We furthermore discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analogue of minimally entangled typical thermal states. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms via an implementation using exact classical emulation as well as through prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit. The quantum imaginary time evolution and Lanczos algorithms offer a resource-efficient way to compute ground or excited states of target Hamiltonians on quantum computers. This offers promise for quantum simulation on near-term noisy devices.

J	Song, HM; Woo, J; Kim, HK				Song, Hyun Min; Woo, Jiyoung; Kim, Huy Kang			In-vehicle network intrusion detection using deep convolutional neural network	VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						In-vehicle network; Controller area network (CAN); Intrusion detection; Convolutional neural network (CNN)	SYSTEMS	The implementation of electronics in modern vehicles has resulted in an increase in attacks targeting invehicle networks; thus, attack detection models have caught the attention of the automotive industry and its researchers. Vehicle network security is an urgent and significant problem because the malfunctioning of vehicles can directly affect human and road safety. The controller area network (CAN), which is used as a de facto standard for in-vehicle networks, does not have sufficient security features, such as message encryption and sender authentication, to protect the network from cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to protect the CAN bus of the vehicle. The DCNN learns the network traffic patterns and detects malicious traffic without hand-designed features. We designed the DCNN model, which was optimized for the data traffic of the CAN bus, to achieve high detection performance while reducing the unnecessary complexity in the architecture of the Inception-ResNet model. We performed an experimental study using the datasets we built with a real vehicle to evaluate our detection system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDS has significantly low false negative rates and error rates when compared to the conventional machine-learning algorithms.

The past decade has witnessed an increased use of user-generated content (UGC) analysis as a marketing tool to make better informed decisions. Likewise, textual data analysis of UGC has gained much attention among tourism and hospitality scholars. Nonetheless, most of the scholarly works have focused on the singular application of an existing method or technique rather than using a multi-method approach. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel Web analytics methodology to examine online reviews posted by tourists in real time and assist decision-makers tasked with marketing strategy and intelligence. Design/methodology/approach For illustration, the case of tourism campaign in India was undertaken. A total of 305,298 reviews were collected, and after filtering, 276,154 reviews were qualified for analysis using a string of models. Descriptive charts, sentiment analysis, clustering, topic modeling and machine learning algorithms for real-time classification were applied. Findings Using big data from TripAdvisor, a total of 145 tourist destinations were clustered based on tourists' perceptions. Further exploration of each cluster through topic modeling was conducted, which revealed interesting insights into satisfiers and dissatisfiers of different clusters of destinations. The results supported the use of the proposed multi-method Web-analytics approach. Practical implications The proposed machine learning model demonstrated that it could provide real-time information on the sentiments in each incoming review about a destination. This information might be useful for taking timely action for improvisation or controlling a service situation. Originality/value In terms of Web-analytics and UGC, a comprehensive analytical model to perform an end-to-end understanding of tourist behavior patterns and offer the potential for real-time interpretation is rarely proposed. The current study not only proposes such a model but also offers empirical evidence for a successful application. It contributes to the literature by providing scholars interested in textual analytics a step-by-step guide to implement a multi-method approach.

Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years. Only a few of them support optimization of multiple conflicting objectives at a time, but do not provide comprehensive tools for a complete multi-objective optimization task. To address this issue, we have developed <italic>pymoo</italic>, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multi-objective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of <italic>pymoo</italic> to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi- and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, <italic>pymoo</italic> addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

With the rapid advancement of high-throughput technologies and the explosion of various biological data and medical data, computational drug repositioning methods have been appealing and powerful techniques to systematically identify potential drug-target interactions and drug-disease interactions. In this review, we first summarize the available biomedical data and public databases related to drugs, diseases and targets. Then, we discuss existing drug repositioning approaches and group them based on their underlying computational models consisting of classical machine learning, network propagation, matrix factorization and completion, and deep learning based models. We also comprehensively analyze common standard data sets and evaluation metrics used in drug repositioning, and give a brief comparison of various prediction methods on the gold standard data sets. Finally, we conclude our review with a brief discussion on challenges in computational drug repositioning, which includes the problem of reducing the noise and incompleteness of biomedical data, the ensemble of various computation drug repositioning methods, the importance of designing reliable negative samples selection methods, new techniques dealing with the data sparseness problem, the construction of large-scale and comprehensive benchmark data sets and the analysis and explanation of the underlying mechanisms of predicted interactions.

Our intent is to understand the current state of research in Industry 4.0 in different disciplines and deduce insights and opportunities for future research in operations management. In this paper, we provide a focused analysis to examine the state-of-the-art research in Industry 4.0. To learn about researchers' perspectives about Industry 4.0, we conducted a large-scale, cross-disciplinary and global survey on Industry 4.0 topics among researchers in industrial engineering, operations management, operations research, control and data science at the 9th IFAC MIM 2019 Conference in Berlin in August 2019. By using our survey findings and literature analysis, we build structural and conceptual frameworks to understand the current state of knowledge and to propose future research opportunities for operations management scholars.

However, modeling these reactions is difficult when water directly participates in the reaction, since it requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the system. Ab-initio molecular dynamics is the ideal candidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a high computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics simulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set of quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is difficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition state config-urations. In this study we used an active learning procedure accelerated by enhanced sampling to harvest such structures and to build a neural-network potential to study the urea decomposition process in water. This allowed us to obtain the free energy profiles of this important reaction in a wide range of temperatures, to discover several novel metastable states, and improve the accuracy of the kinetic rates calculations. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the zwitterionic intermediate has the same probability of occurring via an acidic or a basic pathway, which could be the cause of the insensitivity of reaction rates to the solution pH.

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.

Various research studies indicate that the performance of action recognition is highly dependent on the type of features being extracted and how the actions are represented. Since the release of the Kinect camera, a large number of Kinect-based human action recognition techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, there still does not exist a thorough comparison of these Kinect-based techniques under the grouping of feature types, such as handcrafted versus deep learning features and depth-based versus skeleton-based features. In this paper, we analyze and compare 10 recent Kinect-based algorithms for both cross-subject action recognition and crass-view action recognition using six benchmark datasets. In addition, we have implemented and improved some of these techniques and included their variants in the comparison. Our experiments show that the majority of methods perform better on crass-subject action recognition than crass-view action recognition, that the skeleton-based features are more robust for cross-view recognition than the depth-based features, and that the deep learning features are suitable for large datasets.

With a minority of sites having optimal properties that dominate the catalysis, the overall catalytic activity can increase. In this article, we focus on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We present density functional theory (DFT) calculated *OH and *O adsorption energies on a random subset of available binding sites on the surface of the HEA IrPdPtRhRu. Employing a simple machine learning algorithm, we predict remaining adsorption energies, finding good agreement between calculated and predicted values. With a full catalog of available adsorption energies, an appropriate expression for predicting catalytic activity was used to optimize the HEA composition. The HEA then becomes a design platform for the unbiased discovery of new alloys by promoting sites with exceptional catalytic activity. Setting different optimization constraints led to a new HEA composition and binary alloy IrPt, showing significant enhancements over pure Pt(111).	[Batchelor, Thomas A.

J	Liu, Z; Wu, XJ; Shu, ZQ				Liu, Zhen; Wu, Xiao-Jun; Shu, Zhenqiu			Sparsity augmented discriminative sparse representation for face recognition	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sparse representation; Discriminative sparse representation; Collaborative representation; Face recognition	SIGNAL RECOVERY; SUPERRESOLUTION; CLASSIFICATION	Sparse representation-based classification (SRC) has acquired prominent capability in fields of machine learning and pattern recognition. Collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) has achieved a comparable recognition performance with higher speed compared to SRC, which has attracted much attention because it enables to forgo the computationally quite expensive l(1)-norm sparsity constraint. However, the traditional CRC method neglects the discriminability of representation and recent study has claimed that the sparsity should not be completely neglected for computational costs. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-augmented discriminative sparse representation-based classification method which considers the discriminability and sparsity of representation via augmenting an l(2)-norm regularization discriminative sparse representation with a computationally inexpensive sparse representation.

Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network (RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural network (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining an LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the ICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters (in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the discriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters.

Various research papers have been devoted to thermophysical properties of various hybrid nanofluids. However, a few of them focused on the simultaneous effects of nanoparticles, base fluids, and other factors on the density of hybrid nanofluids. In this research, a comparative study was conducted on non parametric and evolutionary machine learning paradigms, namely, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) and Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR) models to accurately predict the density of a wide variety type of nanofluids in thermal energy applications. Here, for providing the predictive models, 501 data points were collected from the reliable recent literature. Besides, the Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) models were examined for validating the outcomes of MARS and EPR models. The comprehensive assessment demonstrated that the MARS outperformed the other models.

Amazon rainforest photosynthesis increases in response to atmospheric dryness	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; PLANT HYDRAULICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEAF WETNESS; DROUGHT; SEASONALITY; WATER; TRANSPIRATION	Earth system models predict that increases in atmospheric and soil dryness will reduce photosynthesis in the Amazon rainforest, with large implications for the global carbon cycle. Using in situ observations, solar-induced fluorescence, and nonlinear machine learning techniques, we show that, in reality, this is not necessarily the case: In many of the wettest parts of this region, photosynthesis and biomass tend to increase with increased atmospheric dryness, despite the associated reductions in canopy conductance to CO2. These results can be largely explained by changes in canopy properties, specifically, new leaves flushed during the dry season have higher photosynthetic capacity than the leaves they replace, compensating for the negative stomatal response to increased dryness. As atmospheric dryness will increase with climate change, our study highlights the importance of reframing how we represent the response of ecosystem photosynthesis to atmospheric dryness in very wet regions, to accurately quantify the land carbon sink.

This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based energy management strategy for a hybrid electric bus (HEB), with an emphasized consciousness of both thermal safety and degradation of the onboard lithium-ion battery (LIB) system. Firstly, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is combined with an expert-assistance system, for the first time, to enhance the "cold start" performance and optimize the power allocation of HEB. Secondly, in the framework of the proposed algorithm, the penalties to over-temperature and LIB degradation are embedded to improve the management quality in terms of the thermal safety enforcement and overall driving cost reduction. The proposed strategy is tested under different road missions to validate its superiority over state-of-the-art techniques in terms of training efficiency and optimization performance.

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.

How Well Do We Know the Neutron-Matter Equation of State at the Densities Inside Neutron Stars? A Bayesian Approach with Correlated Uncertainties	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								We introduce a new framework for quantifying correlated uncertainties of the infinite-matter equation of state derived from chiral effective field theory (chi EFT). Bayesian machine learning via Gaussian processes with physics-based hyperparameters allows us to efficiently quantify and propagate theoretical uncertainties of the equation of state, such as chi EFT truncation errors, to derived quantities. We apply this framework to state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory calculations with nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions up to fourth order in the chi EFT expansion. This produces the first statistically robust uncertainty estimates for key quantities of neutron stars. We give results up to twice nuclear saturation density for the energy per particle, pressure, and speed of sound of neutron matter, as well as for the nuclear symmetry energy and its derivative. At nuclear saturation density, the predicted symmetry energy and its slope are consistent with experimental constraints.

Unlocking the next generation of phage therapy: the key is in the receptors	CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review							HOST-RANGE; RESISTANCE; TWORT	Phage therapy, the clinical use of viruses that kill bacteria, is a promising strategy in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Before administration, phages under go a careful examination of their safety and interactions with target bacteria. This characterization seldom includes identifying the receptor on the bacterial surface involved in phage adsorption. In this perspective article, we propose that understanding the function and location of these phage receptors can open the door to improved and innovative ways to use phage therapy. With knowledge of phage receptors, we can design intelligent phage cocktails, discover new phage-derived antimicrobials, and steer the evolution of phage-resistance towards clinically exploitable phenotypes. In an effort to jump-start this initiative, we recommend priority groups of hosts and phages. Finally, were view modern approaches for the identification of phage receptors, including molecular platforms for high-throughput mutagenesis, synthetic biology, and machine learning.

Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consor	Genome-wide identification of the genetic basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	NEURON			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION; ANALYSES IDENTIFY; CAUSAL VARIANTS; RISK VARIANTS; ASSOCIATION; PROTEINS; CELLS; RECONSTRUCTION; DEGENERATION; ARCHITECTURE	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex disease that leads to motor neuron death. Despite heritability estimates of 52%, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered relatively few loci. We developed a machine learning approach called RefMap, which integrates functional genomics with GWAS summary statistics for gene discovery. With transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of motor neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), RefMap identified 690 ALS-associated genes that represent a 5-fold increase in recovered heritability. Extensive conservation, transcriptome, network, and rare variant analyses demonstrated the functional significance of candidate genes in healthy and diseased motor neurons and brain tissues. Genetic convergence between common and rare variation highlighted KANK1 as a new ALS gene. Reproducing KANK1 patient mutations in human neurons led to neurotoxicity and demonstrated that TDP-43 mislocalization, a hallmark pathology of ALS, is downstream of axonal dysfunction. RefMap can be readily applied to other complex diseases.

GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Industry 4.0.; Responsible research and innovation; Mission oriented innovation policy; Agricultural innovation systems; Sustainability transitions	DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS; GREEN-REVOLUTION; INNOVATION SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY TRANSITIONS; SECURITY; DESIGN; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE; PATTERNS; TYPOLOGY	Agriculture 4.0 is comprised of different already operational or developing technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, synthetic protein, cellular agriculture, gene editing technology, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning, which may have pervasive effects on future agriculture and food systems and major transformative potential. These technologies underpin concepts such as vertical farming and food systems, digital agriculture, bioeconomy, circular agriculture, and aquaponics. In this perspective paper, we argue that more attention is needed for the inclusion and exclusion effects of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, and for reflection on how they relate to diverse transition pathways towards sustainable agricultural and food systems driven by mission-oriented innovation systems. This would require processes of responsible innovation, anticipating the potential impacts of Agriculture 4.0 through inclusive processes, and reflecting on and being responsive to emerging effects and where needed adjusting the direction and course of transition pathways.

The variable projection (VP) method is a very powerful tool for solving such problems. In this paper, we consider the regularization of ill-conditioned SNLLS problems based on the VP method. Selecting an appropriate regularization parameter is difficult because of the nonlinear optimization procedure. We propose to determine the regularization parameter using the weighted generalized cross-validation method at every iteration. This makes the original objective function changing during the optimization procedure. To circumvent this problem, we use an inequation to produce a consistent demand of decreasing at successive iterations. The approximation of the Jacobian of the regularized problem is also discussed. The proposed regularized VP algorithm is tested by the parameter estimation problem of several statistical models. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

With the rapid development of urban data and machine learning, we can discover the patterns of human mobility with these data and technology to guide commercial district discovery. In this article, we propose an unsupervised commercial district discovery framework via embedding space clustering on graph convolution networks to solve the problem of commercial district discovery. Specifically, the proposed framework aggregates human mobility features according to geographic similarity by graph convolution networks. Based on the graph convolution network embedding space, we apply hierarchical clustering to mine the latent functional regions hidden in different human patterns. Then, with the kernel density estimation, we can obtain the semantic labels for the clustering results to discover commercial districts. Finally, we analyze the multisource data of the Xiaoshan District and Chengdu City, and experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework.

As opposed to popular algorithms such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering or k-means which return a single clustering solution, Bayesian nonparametric models provide a posterior over the entire space of partitions, allowing one to assess statistical properties, such as uncertainty on the number of clusters. However, an important problem is how to summarize the posterior; the huge dimension of partition space and difficulties in visualizing it add to this problem. In a Bayesian analysis, the posterior of a real-valued parameter of interest is often summarized by reporting a point estimate such as the posterior mean along with 95% credible intervals to characterize uncertainty. In this paper, we extend these ideas to develop appropriate point estimates and credible sets to summarize the posterior of the clustering structure based on decision and information theoretic techniques.

Its stable operation will directly affect the safety and reliability of the whole equipment. It is very significant to realize its health status monitoring and intelligent fault diagnosis. In view of the restrictions of traditional mechanical fault diagnosis in the dependence on a large number of signal processing technologies and expert diagnosis experience, as well as the time-consuming of data preprocessing, it is very meaningful to explore new ideas and methods to realize intelligent fault diagnosis of hydraulic piston pump. Based on the standard LeNet-5 model, the kernel size and kernel number are improved, and the batch normalization layers are added to the network architecture. Based on the Improve-LeNet-5 model, the recognition accuracy is chosen as the target value of the fitness function, the hyperparameters of the Improve-LeNet-5 model are automatically optimized via particle swarm optimization (PSO), including the learning rate, the number of convolution kernels, batch size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. Finally, the PSO-Improve-CNN diagnostic model is constructed. And it is employed to classify and identify five signals data of hydraulic piston pump: normal state, swash plate wear, sliding slipper wear, loose slipper and center spring failure. Research result indicates that the recognition accuracy of PSO-Improve-CNN model can reach 98.71%, and the highest recognition accuracy can reach 99.06%, which are respectively higher than the standard LeNet- 5 and Improve-LeNet-5 about 5.23% and 2.25%. By comparing with AlexNet, VGG11, VGG13, VGG16, and GoogleNet, the PSO-Improve-CNN model presents the highest diagnostic accuracy, less time in training and testing, and greater robustness. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model is demonstrated to be much stronger. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Peterson, RA				Peterson, Ryan A.			Finding Optimal Normalizing Transformations via bestNormalize	R JOURNAL			English	Article							FAMILY	The bestNormalize R package was designed to help users find a transformation that can effectively normalize a vector regardless of its actual distribution. Each of the many normalization techniques that have been developed has its own strengths and weaknesses, and deciding which to use until data are fully observed is difficult or impossible. This package facilitates choosing between a range of possible transformations and will automatically return the best one, i.e., the one that makes data look the most normal. To evaluate and compare the normalization efficacy across a suite of possible transformations, we developed a statistic based on a goodness of fit test divided by its degrees of freedom. Transformations can be seamlessly trained and applied to newly observed data and can be implemented in conjunction with caret and recipes for data preprocessing in machine learning workflows.

After lecturing several editions of introductory courses on ENMs and reviewing numerous manuscripts on this subject, we frequently faced some recurrent mistakes: 1) presence-background modelling methods, such as Maxent or ENFA, are used as if they were pseudo-absence methods; 2) spatial autocorrelation is confused with clustering of species records; 3) environmental variables are used with a higher spatial resolution than species records; 4) correlations between variables are not taken into account; 5) machine-learning models are not replicated; 6) topographical variables are calculated from unprojected coordinate systems, and; 7) environmental variables are downscaled by resampling. Some of these mistakes correspond to student misunderstandings and are corrected before publication. However, other errors can be found in published papers. We explain here why these approaches are erroneous and we propose ways to improve them.	[Sillero, Neftali; Barbosa, A.

J	Yu, J; Li, J; Yu, Z; Huang, QM				Yu, Jun; Li, Jing; Yu, Zhou; Huang, Qingming			Multimodal Transformer With Multi-View Visual Representation for Image Captioning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Visualization; Feature extraction; Hidden Markov models; Adaptation models; Task analysis; Decoding; Computational modeling; Image captioning; multi-view learning; deep learning		Image captioning aims to automatically generate a natural language description of a given image, and most state-of-the-art models have adopted an encoder-decoder framework. The framework consists of a convolution neural network (CNN)-based image encoder that extracts region-based visual features from the input image, and an recurrent neural network (RNN) based caption decoder that generates the output caption words based on the visual features with the attention mechanism. Despite the success of existing studies, current methods only model the co-attention that characterizes the inter-modal interactions while neglecting the self-attention that characterizes the intra-modal interactions. Inspired by the success of the Transformer model in machine translation, here we extend it to a Multimodal Transformer (MT) model for image captioning. Compared to existing image captioning approaches, the MT model simultaneously captures intra- and inter-modal interactions in a unified attention block. Due to the in-depth modular composition of such attention blocks, the MT model can perform complex multimodal reasoning and output accurate captions. Moreover, to further improve the image captioning performance, multi-view visual features are seamlessly introduced into the MT model. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our approach using the benchmark MSCOCO image captioning dataset and conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the reasons behind its effectiveness. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods. With an ensemble of seven models, our solution ranks the 1st place on the real-time leaderboard of the MSCOCO image captioning challenge at the time of the writing of this paper.

Retinal layer segmentation is very crucial for doctors to diagnose and study retinal diseases. However, manual segmentation is often a time-consuming and subjective process. In this work, we propose a new method for automatically segmenting retinal OCT images, which integrates deep features and hand-designed features to train a structured random forests classifier. The deep convolutional features are learned from deep residual network. With the trained classifier, we can get the contour probability graph of each layer; finally, the shortest path is employed to achieve the final layer segmentation. The experimental results show that our method achieves good results with the mean layer contour error of 1.215 pixels, whereas that of the state of the art was 1.464 pixels, and achieves an F1-score of 0.885, which is also better than 0.863 that is obtained by the state of the art method.

Various design methods have been developed to determine the optimal compositions of the cement grouting material. However, it is a challenging task to determine the compositions of the materials due to the complexity of cement grouting. In this study, a novel intelligent optimal method by combing the simplicial homology global optimization method (SHGO), Adaptive Boosting algorithm (AdaBoost), and laboratory experiments were developed to determine the optimal composition of the cement grouting material. The AdaBoost presented the complex interrelations of different material compositions and their properties. The SHGO was adopted to search for a reasonable and optimal composition to improve the performance. Compared to the compositions determined by the traditional method, the optimal composition determined by the developed method provides improved strength, especially for the early strength. The flexural/ compressive strengths of the grouting material determined by the proposed method are 3.90/ 12.12 MPa, 9.71/28.86 MPa, 12.11/38.12 MPa at the curing age of 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day, respectively, which are 1.27/1.12 times, 1.17/1.09 times, and 1.11/1.08 times higher than the grouting material determined the traditional method. The developed intelligent optimal framework provides a helpful, valuable, and promising tool for determining the optimal composition of cement-based materials.

J	Pang, GF; Lu, L; Karniadakis, GEM				Pang, Guofei; Lu, Lu; Karniadakis, George E. M.			fPINNs: FRACTIONAL PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL NETWORKS	SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						physics-informed learning machines; fractional advection-diffusion; fractional inverse problem; parameter identification; numerical error analysis	ADVECTION-DISPERSION EQUATIONS; FINITE-DIFFERENCE METHOD; DIFFUSION-EQUATIONS; APPROXIMATIONS; MODELS; MEDIA	Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), introduced in [M. Raissi, P. Perdikaris, and G. Karniadakis, T. Comput. Phys., 378 (2019), pp. 686-707], are effective in solving integer-order partial differential equations (PDEs) based on scattered and noisy data. PINNs employ standard feedforward neural networks (NNs) with the PDEs explicitly encoded into the NN using automatic differentiation, while the sum of the mean-squared PDE residuals and the mean-squared error in initial-boundary conditions is minimized with respect to the NN parameters. Here we extend PINNs to fractional PINNs (fPINNs) to solve space-time fractional advection-diffusion equations (fractional ADEs), and we study systematically their convergence, hence explaining both fPINNs and PINNs for the first time. Specifically, we demonstrate their accuracy and effectiveness in solving multidimensional forward and inverse problems with forcing terms whose values are only known at randomly scattered spatio-temporal coordinates (black-box (BB) forcing terms). A novel element of the fPINNs is the hybrid approach that we introduce for constructing the residual in the loss function using both automatic differentiation for the integer-order operators and numerical discretization for the fractional operators. This approach bypasses the difficulties stemming from the fact that automatic differentiation is not applicable to fractional operators because the standard chain rule in integer calculus is not valid in fractional calculus. To discretize the fractional operators, we employ the Griinwald-Letnikov (GL) formula in one-dimensional fractional ADEs and the vector GL formula in conjunction with the directional fractional Laplacian in two- and three-dimensional fractional ADEs. We first consider the one-dimensional fractional Poisson equation and compare the convergence of the fPINNs against the finite difference method (FDM). We present the solution convergence using both the mean L-2 error as well as the standard deviation due to sensitivity to NN parameter initializations. Using different GL formulas we observe first-, second-, and third-order convergence rates for small size training sets but the error saturates for larger training sets. We explain these results by analyzing the four sources of numerical errors due to discretization, sampling, NN approximation, and optimization. The total error decays monotonically (below 10(-5) for a third-order GL formula) but it saturates beyond that point due to the optimization error. We also analyze the relative balance between discretization and sampling errors and observe that the sampling size and the number of discretization points (auxiliary points) should be comparable to achieve the highest accuracy. As we increase the depth of the NN up to certain value, the mean error decreases and the standard deviation increases, whereas the width has essentially no effect unless its value is either too small or too large. We next consider time-dependent fractional ADEs and compare white-box (WB) and BB forcing. We observe that for the WB forcing, our results are similar to the aforementioned cases; however, for the BB forcing fPINNs outperform FDM. Subsequently, we consider multidimensional time-, space-, and space-time-fractional ADEs using the directional fractional Laplacian and we observe relative errors of 10(-3) similar to 10(-4). Finally, we solve several inverse problems in one, two, and three dimensions to identify the fractional orders, diffusion coefficients, and transport velocities and obtain accurate results given proper initializations even in the presence of significant noise.

Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data can answer targeted biological questions regarding the expression of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, independently, but a systematic multi-omics integration (MOI) can comprehensively assimilate, annotate, and model these large data sets. Previous MOI studies and reviews have detailed its usage and practicality on various organisms including human, animals, microbes, and plants. Plants are especially challenging due to large poorly annotated genomes, multi-organelles, and diverse secondary metabolites. Hence, constructive and methodological guidelines on how to perform MOI for plants are needed, particularly for researchers newly embarking on this topic. In this review, we thoroughly classify multi-omics studies on plants and verify workflows to ensure successful omics integration with accurate data representation. We also propose three levels of MOI, namely element-based (level 1), pathway-based (level 2), and mathematical-based integration (level 3). These MOI levels are described in relation to recent publications and tools, to highlight their practicality and function. The drawbacks and limitations of these MOI are also discussed for future improvement toward more amenable strategies in plant systems biology.

Combining multi-modal data for classification can better realize the complementarity of valuable information. In order to improve the classification performance of feature selection on multi-modal data, we propose a multi-modal feature selection algorithm using feature correlation and feature structure fusion (FC2FS). First, we construct feature correlation regularization by fusing a similarity matrix between multi-modal feature nodes. Then, based on manifold learning, we employ feature matrix fusion to construct feature structure regularization, and learn the local geometric structure of the feature nodes. Finally, the two regularizations are embedded in a multi-task learning model that introduces low-rank constraint, the multi-modal features are selected, and the final features are linearly fused and input into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Different controlled experiments were set to verify the validity of the proposed method, which was applied to MCI and AD classification. The accuracy of normal controls versus Alzheimer's disease, normal controls versus late mild cognitive impairment, normal controls versus early mild cognitive impairment, and early mild cognitive impairment versus late mild cognitive impairment achieve 91.85 +/- 1.42%, 85.33 +/- 2.22%, 78.29 +/- 2.20%, and 77.67 +/- 1.65%, respectively. This method makes up for the shortcomings of the traditional multi-modal feature selection based on subjects and fully considers the relationship between feature nodes and the local geometric structure of feature space. Our study not only enhances the interpretation of feature selection but also improves the classification performance, which has certain reference values for the identification of MCI and AD.

Vision tasks, such as human pose estimation, did not escape from this trend. There is a large number of deep models, where small changes in the network architecture, or in the data pre-processing, together with the stochastic nature of the optimization procedures, produce notably different results, making extremely difficult to sift methods that significantly outperform others. This situation motivates the current study, in which we perform a systematic evaluation and statistical analysis of vanilla deep regression, i.e., convolutional neural networks with a linear regression top layer. This is the first comprehensive analysis of deep regression techniques. We perform experiments on four vision problems, and report confidence intervals for the median performance as well as the statistical significance of the results, if any. Surprisingly, the variability due to different data pre-processing procedures generally eclipses the variability due to modifications in the network architecture. Our results reinforce the hypothesis according to which, in general, a general-purpose network (e.g., VGG-16 or ResNet-50) adequately tuned can yield results close to the state-of-the-art without having to resort to more complex and ad-hoc regression models.

Though GSA is an effective population-based algorithm, it exhibits low search performance and premature convergence. To ameliorate these issues, this work proposes a multi-layered GSA called MLGSA. Inspired by the two-layered structure of GSA, four layers consisting of population, iteration-best, personal-best and global-best layers are constructed. Hierarchical interactions among four layers are dynamically implemented in different search stages to greatly improve both exploration and exploitation abilities of population. Performance comparison between MLGSA and nine existing GSA variants on twenty-nine CEC2017 test functions with low, medium and high dimensions demonstrates that MLGSA is the most competitive one. It is also compared with four particle swarm optimization variants to verify its excellent performance. Moreover, the analysis of hierarchical interactions is discussed to illustrate the influence of a complete hierarchy on its performance. The relationship between its population diversity and fitness diversity is analyzed to clarify its search performance. Its computational complexity is given to show its efficiency. Finally, it is applied to twenty-two CEC2011 real-world optimization problems to show its practicality.

Numerous studies have mentioned that manual segmentation takes time, and depends on the machine and the operator. The algorithm called Convolutional Neural Network Improvement for Breast Cancer Classification (CNNI-BCC) is presented to assist medical experts in breast cancer diagnosis in timely manner. The CNNI-BCC uses a convolutional neural network that improves the breast cancer lesion classification in order to help experts for breast cancer diagnosis. CNNI-BCC can classify incoming breast cancer medical images into malignant, benign, and healthy patients. The application of present algorithm can assist in classification of mammographic medical images into benign patient, malignant patient and healthy patient without prior information of the presence of a cancerous lesion. The presented method aims to help medical experts for the classification of breast cancer lesion through the implementation of convolutional neural network for the classification of breast cancer. CNNI-BCC can categorize incoming medical images as malignant, benign or normal patient with sensitivity, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and specificity of 89.47%, 90.50%, 0.901 +/- 0.0314 and 90.71% respectively.

In this article, Wang and colleagues show that the deep learning approach, combined with the feedback from radiologists, produces higher quality reconstructions than or similar to that using the current commercial methods. Commercial iterative reconstruction techniques help to reduce the radiation dose of computed tomography (CT), but altered image appearance and artefacts can limit their adoptability and potential use. Deep learning has been investigated for low-dose CT (LDCT). Here, we design a modularized neural network for LDCT and compare it with commercial iterative reconstruction methods from three leading CT vendors. Although popular networks are trained for an end-to-end mapping, our network performs an end-to-process mapping so that intermediate denoised images are obtained with associated noise reduction directions towards a final denoised image. The learned workflow allows radiologists in the loop to optimize the denoising depth in a task-specific fashion. Our network was trained with the Mayo LDCT Dataset and tested on separate chest and abdominal CT exams from Massachusetts General Hospital. The best deep learning reconstructions were systematically compared to the best iterative reconstructions in a double-blinded reader study. This study confirms that our deep learning approach performs either favourably or comparably in terms of noise suppression and structural fidelity, and is much faster than commercial iterative reconstruction algorithms.

J	Lin, Y; Li, LC; Jing, HL; Ran, B; Sun, DY				Lin, Yi; Li, Linchao; Jing, Hailong; Ran, Bin; Sun, Dongye			Automated traffic incident detection with a smaller dataset based on generative adversarial networks	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						GANs; Imbalance training samples; Incident detection; Spatial and temporal rules	NEURAL-NETWORK; CRASHES; MODEL	An imbalanced and small training sample can cause an incident detection model to have a low detection rate and a high false alarm rate. To solve the scarcity of incident samples, a novel incident detection framework is proposed based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). First, spatial and temporal rules are presented to extract variables from traffic data, which is followed by the random forest algorithm to rank the importance of variables. Then, some new incident samples are generated using GANs. Finally, the support vector machine algorithm is applied as the incident detection model. Real traffic data, which were collected from a 69.5-mile section of the I-80 highway, are used to validate the proposed approach. A total of 140 detectors are installed on the section enabling traffic flow to be measured every 30s. During 14 days, 139 incident samples and 946 nonincident samples were extracted from the raw data. Five categories of experiments are designed to evaluate whether the proposed framework can solve the small sample size problem, imbalanced sample problem, and timeliness problem in the current incident detection system. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can considerably improve the detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate of traffic incident detection. The balance of the dataset can improve the detection rate from 87.48% to 90.68% and reduce the false alarm rate from 12.76% to 7.11%. This paper lends support to further studies on combining GANs with the machine learning model to address the imbalance and small sample size problems related to intelligent transportation systems.

Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intravehicle and external networks due to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this article, the vulnerabilities of intravehicle and external networks are discussed, and a multitiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the IVN data and 99.88% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 data set illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two data sets, respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed IDS.

By comparing the training data sets, it is found that using the real-world historical speed information for training can achieve higher prediction accuracy than using typical standard driving cycles. The speed predictor trained based on the data considering travel route information can further improve the prediction accuracy. The impact of battery temperature on the total cost is also analyzed. By adjusting the temperature weighting coefficient of the battery, a balance between economy and battery aging can be achieved. In addition, it is found that the ambient temperature also affects vehicular energy consumption. Finally, the proposed method is compared with PMP, MPC, and CD-CS methods, showing its effectiveness and practicability.

During the past decades, Europe has experienced a series of droughts that caused substantial socioeconomic losses and environmental impacts. A key question is whether there are some similar characteristics in these droughts, especially when compared to the droughts that occurred further in the past. Answering this question is impossible with traditional single-index approaches and also short-term and often spatially inconsistent records. Here, using a multidimensional machine learning-based clustering algorithm and the hydrologic reconstruction of European drought, we determine the dominant drought types and investigate the changes in drought typology. We report a substantial increase in shorter warm-season droughts that are concurrent with an increase in potential evapotranspiration. If shifts reported here persist, then we will need new adaptive water management policies and, in the long run, we may observe considerable alterations in vegetation regimes and ecosystem functioning.

Although tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites have been identified in human cells, approaches to determine the functional importance of each phosphosite are lacking. Here, we manually curated 112 datasets of phospho-enriched proteins, generated from 104 different human cell types or tissues. We re-analyzed the 6,801 proteomics experiments that passed our quality control criteria, creating a reference phosphoproteome containing 119,809 human phosphosites. To prioritize functional sites, we used machine learning to identify 59 features indicative of proteomic, structural, regulatory or evolutionary relevance and integrate them into a single functional score. Our approach identifies regulatory phosphosites across different molecular mechanisms, processes and diseases, and reveals genetic susceptibilities at a genomic scale. Several regulatory phosphosites were experimentally validated, including identifying a role in neuronal differentiation for phosphosites in SMARCC2, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex.

Replication plays an important role in that context, however previous methods leveraging replicates have either ignored the computational savings that come from such design, or have short-cut full likelihood-based inference to remain tractable. Starting with homoscedastic processes, we show how multiple applications of a well-known Woodbury identity facilitate inference for all parameters under the likelihood (without approximation), bypassing the typical full-data sized calculations. We then borrow a latent-variable idea from machine learning to address heteroscedasticity, adapting it to work within the same thrifty inferential framework, thereby simultaneously leveraging the computational and statistical efficiency of designs with replication. The result is an inferential scheme that can be characterized as single objective function, complete with closed form derivatives, for rapid library-based optimization. Illustrations are provided, including real-world simulation experiments from manufacturing and the management of epidemics.

Negative Patient Descriptors: Documenting Racial Bias In The Electronic Health Record	HEALTH AFFAIRS			English	Article							IMPLICIT RACIAL/ETHNIC BIAS; CARE; ATTITUDES; RACE	Little is known about how racism and bias may be communicated in the medical record. This study used machine learning to analyze electronic health records (EHRs) from an urban academic medical center and to investigate whether providers' use of negative patient descriptors varied by patient race or ethnicity. We analyzed a sample of 40,113 history and physical notes (January 2019-October 2020) from 18,459 patients for sentences containing a negative descriptor (for example, resistant or noncompliant) of the patient or the patient's behavior. We used mixed effects logistic regression to determine the odds of finding at least one negative descriptor as a function of the patient's race or ethnicity, controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics. Compared with White patients, Black patients had 2.54 times the odds of having at least one negative descriptor in the history and physical notes. Our findings raise concerns about stigmatizing language in the EHR and its potential to exacerbate racial and ethnic health care disparities.

Moreover, 6G will provide superior coverage by integrating space/air/underwater networks with terrestrial networks, given that traditional wireless communications are not able to provide high-speed data rates for nonterrestrial networks. Visible light communication (VLC) is a high-speed communication technique with an unlicensed frequency range of 400-800 THz and can be adopted as an alternative approach to solving these problems. In this article, we present the prospects and challenges of VLC in 6G in conjunction with its advances in high-speed transmissions. Recent hot research interests, including new materials and devices, advanced modulation, underwater VLC (UVLC), and signal processing based on machine learning, are also discussed. It is envisaged that VLC will become an indispensable part of 6G given its high-speed transmission advantages and will cooperate with other communication methods to benefit our daily lives.

However, the mechanisms behind the coronavirus infection are not yet fully understood, nor are there any targeted treatments or vaccines. In this study, we identified high-binding-affinity aptamers targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD, using an ACE2 competition-based aptamer selection strategy and a machine learning screening algorithm. The Kd values of the optimized CoV2-RBD-1C and CoV2-RBD-4C aptamers against RBD were 5.8 nM and 19.9 nM, respectively. Simulated interaction modeling, along with competitive experiments, suggests that two aptamers may have partially identical binding sites at ACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These aptamers present an opportunity for generating new probes for recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 while providing a new tool for in-depth study of the mechanisms behind the coronavirus infection.

A cyber-physical system (CPS)-based framework is proposed for codesign optimization of the plant and controller parameters for an automated electric vehicle, in view of vehicle's dynamic performance, drivability, and energy along with different driving styles. System description, requirements, constraints, optimization objectives, and methodology are investigated. Driving style recognition algorithm is developed using unsupervised machine learning and validated via vehicle experiments. Adaptive control algorithms are designed for three driving styles with different protocol selections. Performance exploration method is presented. Parameter optimizations are implemented based on the defined objective functions. Test results show that an automated vehicle with optimized plant and controller can perform its tasks well under aggressive, moderate, and conservative driving styles, further improving the overall performance. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed CPS-based codesign optimization approach.

Customers buy and use goods that produce a considerable amount of waste. Waste management is a major problem since the number of consumers increased due to high waste generation. This has resulted in a huge amount of waste, which calls for enormous waste-management policies. Reduce; Reuse, Recycle, and Recover are the tools to reduce the adverse implications of retailing and manufacturing on the environment. In this paper, Artificial Intelligence based Hybridized Intelligent Framework (AIHIF) has been proposed for automated recycling to optimizing the waste management process. The system will optimize waste collection with a short distance by utilizing machine learning and graph theory. AI design technology, which helps different approaches adapted to interest groups, collecting their specific information and greatly improving environmental planning and urban management performance, accuracy, and efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed method enhances performance and accuracy when compared to other existing methods.

Physically informed artificial neural networks for atomistic modeling of materials	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; POTENTIAL-ENERGY SURFACES; EMBEDDED-ATOM METHOD; INTERATOMIC POTENTIALS; HYDROCARBONS; METALS; CHEMISTRY; SCIENCE	Large-scale atomistic computer simulations of materials heavily rely on interatomic potentials predicting the energy and Newtonian forces on atoms. Traditional interatomic potentials are based on physical intuition but contain few adjustable parameters and are usually not accurate. The emerging machine-learning (ML) potentials achieve highly accurate interpolation within a large DFT database but, being purely mathematical constructions, suffer from poor transferability to unknown structures. We propose a new approach that can drastically improve the transferability of ML potentials by informing them of the physical nature of interatomic bonding. This is achieved by combining a rather general physics-based model (analytical bond-order potential) with a neural-network regression. This approach, called the physically informed neural network (PINN) potential, is demonstrated by developing a general-purpose PINN potential for Al. We suggest that the development of physics-based ML potentials is the most effective way forward in the field of atomistic simulations.	[Pun, G. P.

Today, density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain comparatively expensive and scale poorly with system size. Here we show that deep neural networks utilizing just two descriptors-the Pauling electronegativity and ionic radii-can predict the DFT formation energies of C(3)A(2)D(3)O(12) garnets and ABO(3) perovskites with low mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 7-10 meV atom(-1) and 20-34 meV atom(-1), respectively, well within the limits of DFT accuracy. Further extension to mixed garnets and perovskites with little loss in accuracy can be achieved using a binary encoding scheme, addressing a critical gap in the extension of machine-learning models from fixed stoichiometry crystals to infinite universe of mixed-species crystals. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these models to rapidly transverse vast chemical spaces to accurately identify stable compositions, accelerating the discovery of novel materials with potentially superior properties.

Quantified transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and lipids were associated with clinical outcomes in a curated relational database, uniquely enabling systems analysis and cross-ome correlations to molecules and patient prognoses. We mapped 219 molecular features with high significance to COVID-19 status and severity, many of which were involved in complement activation, dysregulated lipid transport, and neutrophil activation. We identified sets of covarying molecules, e.g., protein gelsolin and metabolite citrate or plasmalogens and apolipoproteins, offering pathophysiological insights and therapeutic suggestions. The observed dysregulation of platelet function, blood coagulation, acute phase response, and endotheliopathy further illuminated the unique COVID-19 phenotype.

J	Kanehisa, M; Sato, Y; Kawashima, M				Kanehisa, Minoru; Sato, Yoko; Kawashima, Masayuki			KEGG mapping tools for uncovering hidden features in biological data	PROTEIN SCIENCE			English	Article						BRITE hierarchical classification; genome annotation; KEGG; KEGG mapper; KEGG module; KEGG orthology; KEGG pathway map	TAXONOMY; GENOME	In contrast to artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, KEGG () has relied on human intelligence to develop "models" of biological systems, especially in the form of KEGG pathway maps that are manually created by capturing knowledge from published literature. The KEGG models can then be used in biological big data analysis, for example, for uncovering systemic functions of an organism hidden in its genome sequence through the simple procedure of KEGG mapping. Here we present an updated version of KEGG Mapper, a suite of KEGG mapping tools reported previously (Kanehisa and Sato, Protein Sci 2020; 29:28-35), together with the new versions of the KEGG pathway map viewer and the BRITE hierarchy viewer. Significant enhancements have been made for BRITE mapping, where the mapping result can be examined by manipulation of hierarchical trees, such as pruning and zooming. The tree manipulation feature has also been implemented in the taxonomy mapping tool for linking KO (KEGG Orthology) groups and modules to phenotypes.

Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation	NATURE ENERGY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; HIGH-POWER; CYLINDRICAL CELLS; HEALTH ESTIMATION; AGING MECHANISM; FADE ANALYSIS; PACKS; STATE; INHOMOGENEITIES	Accurately predicting the lifetime of complex, nonlinear systems such as lithium-ion batteries is critical for accelerating technology development. However, diverse aging mechanisms, significant device variability and dynamic operating conditions have remained major challenges. We generate a comprehensive dataset consisting of 124 commercial lithium iron phosphate/graphite cells cycled under fast-charging conditions, with widely varying cycle lives ranging from 150 to 2,300 cycles. Using discharge voltage curves from early cycles yet to exhibit capacity degradation, we apply machine-learning tools to both predict and classify cells by cycle life. Our best models achieve 9.1% test error for quantitatively predicting cycle life using the first 100 cycles (exhibiting a median increase of 0.2% from initial capacity) and 4.9% test error using the first 5 cycles for classifying cycle life into two groups. This work highlights the promise of combining deliberate data generation with data-driven modelling to predict the behaviour of complex dynamical systems.

SRS Task Force	Metrics of sleep apnea severity: beyond the apnea-hypopnea index	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep; apnea; hypoxia; cardiovascular; lung; hypopnea	POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASH; ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY; ODDS RATIO PRODUCT; BLOOD-PRESSURE; RISK-FACTOR; INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA	Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is thought to affect almost 1 billion people worldwide. OSA has well established cardiovascular and neurocognitive sequelae, although the optimal metric to assess its severity and/or potential response to therapy remains unclear. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is well established; thus, we review its history and predictive value in various different clinical contexts. Although the AHI is often criticized for its limitations, it remains the best studied metric of OSA severity, albeit imperfect. We further review the potential value of alternative metrics including hypoxic burden, arousal intensity, odds ratio product, and cardiopulmonary coupling. We conclude with possible future directions to capture clinically meaningful OSA endophenotypes including the use of genetics, blood biomarkers, machine/deep learning and wearable technologies. Further research in OSA should be directed towards providing diagnostic and prognostic information to make the OSA diagnosis more accessible and to improving prognostic information regarding OSA consequences, in order to guide patient care and to help in the design of future clinical trials.

MGH COV1D-19 Collection Proc Team	Viral epitope profiling of COVID-19 patients reveals cross-reactivity and correlates of severity	SCIENCE			English	Article							CYTOMEGALOVIRUS-INFECTION; CORONAVIRUS; ANTIBODIES; SPIKE	Understanding humoral responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Preexisting antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, whereas only COVID-19 patient antibodies primarily recognized spike protein and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males produce stronger SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females.

In this article, we exploit the combination of machine learning techniques and fusion schemes introduced to address the pansharpening problem. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are proposed to solve this issue. The latter is combined first with the traditional component substitution and multiresolution analysis fusion schemes in order to estimate the nonlinear injection models that rule the combination of the upsampled low-resolution MS image with the extracted details exploiting the two philosophies. Furthermore, inspired by these two approaches, we also developed another DCNN for pansharpening. This is fed by the direct difference between the PAN image and the upsampled low-resolution MS image. Extensive experiments conducted both at reduced and full resolutions demonstrate that this latter convolutional neural network outperforms both the other detail injection-based proposals and several state-of-the-art pansharpening methods.

J	Alazzam, H; Sharieh, A; Sabri, KE				Alazzam, Hadeel; Sharieh, Ahmad; Sabri, Khair Eddin			A feature selection algorithm for intrusion detection system based on Pigeon Inspired Optimizer	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Intrusion Detection System; KDDCUP; Pigeon Inspired Optimizer	SWARM OPTIMIZATION; COLONY	Feature selection plays a vital role in building machine learning models. Irrelevant features in data affect the accuracy of the model and increase the training time needed to build the model. Feature selection is an important process to build Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In this paper, a wrapper feature selection algorithm for IDS is proposed. This algorithm uses the pigeon inspired optimizer to utilize the selection process. A new method to binarize a continuous pigeon inspired optimizer is proposed and compared to the traditional way for binarizing continuous swarm intelligent algorithms. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using three popular datasets: KDDCUP99, NLS-KDD and UNSW-NB15. The proposed algorithm outperformed several feature selection algorithms from state-of-the-art related works in terms of TPR, FPR, accuracy, and F-score. Also, the proposed cosine similarity method for binarizing the algorithm has a faster convergence than the sigmoid method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this review, we present an overview of recent studies using Machine Learning and, more broadly, Artificial Intelligence, to tackle many aspects of the COVID-19 crisis. We have identified applications that address challenges posed by COVID-19 at different scales, including: molecular, by identifying new or existing drugs for treatment; clinical, by supporting diagnosis and evaluating prognosis based on medical imaging and non-invasive measures; and societal, by tracking both the epidemic and the accompanying infodemic using multiple data sources. We also review datasets, tools, and resources needed to facilitate Artificial Intelligence research, and discuss strategic considerations related to the operational implementation of multidisciplinary partnerships and open science. We highlight the need for international cooperation to maximize the potential of AI in this and future pandemics.

This paper seeks to show the efficacy of micro-Doppler analysis to distinguish even those gaits whose micro-Doppler signatures are not visually distinguishable. Moreover, a three-layer, deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is proposed, which utilizes unsupervised pretraining to initialize the weights in the subsequent convolutional layers. This architecture is shown to be more effective than other deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks and autoencoders, as well as conventional classifiers employing predefined features, such as support vector machines (SVM), random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. Results show the performance of the proposed deep CAE yields a correct classification rate of 94.2% for micro-Doppler signatures of 12 different human activities measured indoors using a 4 GHz continuous wave radar-17.3% improvement over SVM.

Therefore, it will be critical to allocate and utilize the available wireless network resources in an ultra-efficient manner. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on resource allocation schemes for the two dominant vehicular network technologies, e.g. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and cellular based vehicular networks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities for resource allocations in modern vehicular networks and outline a number of promising future research directions.

In the present study, landslide susceptibility evaluation was undertaken using novel ensembles of bivariate statistical-methods-based (evidential belief function (EBF), statistical index (SI), and weights of evidence (WoE)) kernel logistic regression machine learning classifiers. A landslide inventory comprising 222 landslides and 15 conditioning factors (slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, profile curvature, stream power index, sediment transport index, topographic wetness index, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to faults, NDVI, land use, lithology, and rainfall) was prepared as the spatial database. Correlation analysis and selection of conditioning factors were conducted using multicollinearity analysis and classifier attribute evaluation methods, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic curve method was used to validate the models. The areas under the success rate (AUC_T) and prediction rate (AUC_P) curves and landslide density analysis were also used to assess the prediction capability of the landslide susceptibility maps. Results showed that the EBF-KLR hybrid model had the highest predictive capability in landslide susceptibility assessment (AUC values of 0.814 and 0.753 for the training and validation datasets, respectively; AUC_T value of 0.8511 and AUC_P value of 0.7615), followed in descending order by the SI-KLR and WoE-KLR hybrid models. These findings indicate that hybrid models could improve the predictive capability of bivariate models, and that the EBF-KLR is a promising hybrid model for the spatial prediction of landslides in susceptible areas.

We present a variational quantum algorithm for finding the desired generalized eigenvalue of the GE problem, A vertical bar psi = lambda B vertical bar psi , by choosing suitable loss functions. Our approach imposes the superposition of the trial state and the obtained eigenvectors with respect to the weighting matrix B on the Rayleigh quotient. Furthermore, both the values and derivatives of the loss functions can be calculated on near-term quantum devices with shallow quantum circuit. Finally, we propose a full quantum generalized eigensolver (FQGE) to calculate the minimal generalized eigenvalue with quantum gradient descent algorithm. As a demonstration of the principle, we numerically implement our algorithms to conduct a 2-qubit simulation and successfully find the generalized eigenvalues of the matrix pencil (A, B). The numerically experimental result indicates that FQGE is robust under Gaussian noise.

In this paper, the relationship between the species of biomass-based electrode and properties of supercapacitors are systematically discussed. On the one hand, the influence of the specific morphologies, heteroatom-introducing and graphitization degree of active carbon on the electrochemical properties are analyzed in detail, which give a promising direction for biomass-based carbon in clean energy field. On the other hand, machine learning, especially artificial neural network model, has been widely used as data mining technology to predict the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. It makes the structure-performance relationship for biomass-based supercapacitors more specifically. Current development in synthesis of active carbon from biomass combined with theoretical prediction is summarized, which provides a meaningful guidance into the application of energy storage supercapacitors. Current challenges and new trends on the biomass-based carbon materials in supercapacitors have also been proposed.

Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals AML Hierarchies Relevant to Disease Progression and Immunity	CELL			English	Article							STEM-CELLS; SUPPRESSOR-CELLS; LEUKEMIA; PROGENITOR; CANCER; GENOMICS; FUTURE	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that resides within a complex microenvironment, complicating efforts to understand how different cell types contribute to disease progression. We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and genotyping to profile 38,410 cells from 40 bone marrow aspirates, including 16 AML patients and five healthy donors. We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. Cell type compositions correlated with prototypic genetic lesions, including an association of FLT3-ITD with abundant progenitor-like cells. Primitive AML cells exhibited dysregulated transcriptional programs with co-expression of stemness and myeloid priming genes and had prognostic significance. Differentiated monocyte-like AML cells expressed diverse immunomodulatory genes and suppressed T cell activity in vitro. In conclusion, we provide single-cell technologies and an atlas of AML cell states, regulators, and markers with implications for precision medicine and immune therapies.

By combining density functional theory (DFT) with supervised machine learning, we predict the CO and hydrogen (H) adsorption energies of all surface sites on the (1 1 1) surfaces of the disordered CoCuGaNiZn and AgAuCuPdPt HEAs. This allows an optimization for the HEA compositions with increased likelihood for sites with weak hydrogen adsorption to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen and with strong CO adsorption to favor the reduction of CO. As opposed to the construction of specific arrangements of surface atoms, our approach makes the desired surface sites more frequent through an increase in their probability. This leads to the unbiased discovery of several catalyst candidates for which selectivity toward highly reduced carbon compounds is expected and of which some have been verified in the literature.

In many settings, most prominently in so-called parametrized or variational algorithms, the objective function is a result of hybrid quantum-classical processing. To optimize the objective, it is useful to have access to exact gradients of quantum circuits with respect to gate parameters. This paper shows how gradients of expectation values of quantum measurements can be estimated using the same, or almost the same, architecture that executes the original circuit. It generalizes previous results for qubit-based platforms, and proposes recipes for the computation of gradients of continuous-variable circuits. Interestingly, in many important instances it is sufficient to run the original quantum circuit twice while shifting a single gate parameter to obtain the corresponding component of the gradient. More general cases can be solved by conditioning a single gate on an ancilla.

Here, we report on DNA methylation-based central nervous system (CNS) tumor diagnostics conducted in our institution between the years 2015 and 2018. In this period, more than 1000 tumors from the neurosurgical departments in Heidelberg and Mannheim and more than 1000 tumors referred from external institutions were subjected to DNA methylation analysis for diagnostic purposes. We describe our current approach to the integrated diagnosis of CNS tumors with a focus on constellations with conflicts between morphological and molecular genetic findings. We further describe the benefit of integrating DNA copy-number alterations into diagnostic considerations and provide a catalog of copy-number changes for individual DNA methylation classes. We also point to several pitfalls accompanying the diagnostic implementation of DNA methylation profiling and give practical suggestions for recurring diagnostic scenarios.

Single-pixel imaging 12 years on: a review	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Review							SIGNAL RECOVERY; LASER-RADAR; LIGHT; MICROSCOPY; SPARSITY	Modern cameras typically use an array of millions of detector pixels to capture images. By contrast, single-pixel cameras use a sequence of mask patterns to filter the scene along with the corresponding measurements of the transmitted intensity which is recorded using a single-pixel detector. This review considers the development of single-pixel cameras from the seminal work of Duarte et al. up to the present state of the art. We cover the variety of hardware configurations, design of mask patterns and the associated reconstruction algorithms, many of which relate to the field of compressed sensing and, more recently, machine learning. Overall, single-pixel cameras lend themselves to imaging at non-visible wavelengths and with precise timing or depth resolution. We discuss the suitability of single-pixel cameras for different application areas, including infrared imaging and 3D situation awareness for autonomous vehicles.

Understanding the diversity of the metal-organic framework ecosystem	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							BUILDING UNITS; DESIGN; MOFS; DISCOVERY; STORAGE; SIMULATION; CHEMISTRY	Millions of distinct metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be made by combining metal nodes and organic linkers. At present, over 90,000 MOFs have been synthesized and over 500,000 predicted. This raises the question whether a new experimental or predicted structure adds new information. For MOF chemists, the chemical design space is a combination of pore geometry, metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional groups, but at present we do not have a formalism to quantify optimal coverage of chemical design space. In this work, we develop a machine learning method to quantify similarities of MOFs to analyse their chemical diversity. This diversity analysis identifies biases in the databases, and we show that such bias can lead to incorrect conclusions. The developed formalism in this study provides a simple and practical guideline to see whether new structures will have the potential for new insights, or constitute a relatively small variation of existing structures.

Recently, the DeepMind's AlphaFold2 machine learning method greatly expanded the structural coverage of sequences with high accuracy. Since the employed algorithm did not take specific properties of TM proteins into account, the reliability of the generated TM structures should be assessed. Therefore, we quantitatively investigated the quality of structures at genome scales, at the level of ABC protein superfamily folds and for specific membrane proteins (e.g. dimer modeling and stability in molecular dynamics simulations). We tested template-free structure prediction with a challenging TM CASP14 target and several TM protein structures published after AlphaFold2 training. Our results suggest that AlphaFold2 performs well in the case of TM proteins and its neural network is not overfitted. We conclude that cautious applications of AlphaFold2 structural models will advance TM protein-associated studies at an unexpected level.

Bioinformatics tools developed for miRNA study include those for miRNA prediction and discovery, structure, analysis and target prediction. We manually curated 95 review papers and similar to 1000 miRNA bioinformatics tools published since 2003. We classified and ranked them based on citation number or Page Rank score, and then performed network analysis and text mining (TM) to study the miRNA tools development trends. Five key trends were observed: (1) miRNA identification and target prediction have been hot spots in the past decade; (2) manual curation and TM are the main methods for collecting miRNA knowledge from literature; (3) most early tools are well maintained and widely used; (4) classic machine learning methods retain their utility; however, novel ones have begun to emerge; (5) disease-associated miRNA tools are emerging. Our analysis yields significant insight into the past development and future directions of miRNA tools.

Abrupt but smaller than expected changes in surface air quality attributable to COVID-19 lockdowns	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							METEOROLOGICAL NORMALIZATION; POLLUTION; OZONE	The COVID-19 lockdowns led to major reductions in air pollutant emissions. Here, we quantitatively evaluate changes in ambient NO2, O-3, and PM2.5 concentrations arising from these emission changes in 11 cities globally by applying a deweathering machine learning technique. Sudden decreases in deweathered NO2 concentrations and increases in O-3 were observed in almost all cities. However, the decline in NO2 concentrations attributable to the lockdowns was not as large as expected, at reductions of 10 to 50%. Accordingly, O-3 increased by 2 to 30% (except for London), the total gaseous oxidant (O-x = NO2 + O-3) showed limited change, and PM2.5 concentrations decreased in most cities studied but increased in London and Paris. Our results demonstrate the need for a sophisticated analysis to quantify air quality impacts of interventions and indicate that true air quality improvements were notably more limited than some earlier reports or observational data suggested.

J	Saurabh, S; Dey, K				Saurabh, Samant; Dey, Kushankur			Blockchain technology adoption, architecture, and sustainable agri-food supply chains	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Grape wine supply chain; Blockchain; Technology adoption; Traceability; Disintermediation; Conjoint analysis	GOVERNANCE	The emerging Information and Communication Technology play a vital role in electronic agriculture. The application of such technologies as blockchain, Internet-of-Things, wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and machine learning can improve the agri-food supply chain efficiency and quality management. However, there is little evidence on the determinants of blockchain integrated ICTs adoption for the supply chain actors and their propensity to embrace and use such technologies. To bridge this research gap in the literature, we identify a few potential drivers of blockchain technology adoption, considering the grape wine supply chain and employing a rating-based conjoint analysis. The study finds that dis-intermediation, traceability, price, trust, compliance, and coordination and control in order of their relative importance and utilities can influence the supply chain actors' adoption-intention decision processes. The adoption factors further rationalize the design for a modular, scalable, interoperable, and cost-effective architecture for supply chain integration and sustainability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Advanced optical methods now enable the interrogation of orders of magnitude more tissue than previously possible, where volumetric imaging allows for enhanced quantitative analyses of cell distributions and tissue structures that are prognostic and predictive. Non-destructive imaging processes can simplify laboratory workflows, potentially reducing costs, and can ensure that samples are available for subsequent molecular assays. However, the large size of the feature-rich datasets that they generate poses challenges for data management and computer-aided analysis. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the imaging technologies that enable 3D pathology, and the computational tools-machine learning, in particular-for image processing and interpretation. We also discuss the integration of various other diagnostic modalities with 3D pathology, along with the challenges and opportunities for clinical adoption and regulatory approval.	[Liu, Jonathan T.

To achieve the goal, this paper presents a daily activity feature selection strategy based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Firstly, a daily activity feature is viewed as a vector in Pearson Correlation Coefficient formula. Secondly, the relation degree between daily activity features is obtained according to weighted Pearson Correlation Coefficient formula. At last, redundant features are removed by the relation degree between daily activity features. Two distinct datasets are adopted to mitigate the effects of the coupling of the dataset used and the sensor configuration. Three different machine learning techniques are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in activity recognition. The experiment results show that the proposed approach yields higher recognition rates and achieves average improvement F-measures of 1.56% and 2.7%, respectively.

Accelerated Discovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution from Water through the Integration of Experiment and Theory	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							COVALENT TRIAZINE FRAMEWORKS; CRYSTALLINE CARBON NITRIDES; POROUS CONJUGATED POLYMERS; LIGHT; PHOTOREDUCTION	Conjugated polymers are an emerging class of photocatalysts for hydrogen production where the large breadth of potential synthetic diversity presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Here, we integrate robotic experimentation with high-throughput computation to navigate the available structure-property space. A total of 6354 co-polymers was considered computationally, followed by the synthesis and photocatalytic characterization of a sub-library of more than 170 co-polymers. This led to the discovery of new polymers with sacrificial hydrogen evolution rates (HERs) of more than 6 mmol g(-1) h(-1). The variation in HER across the library does not correlate strongly with any single physical property, but a machine-learning model involving four separate properties can successfully describe up to 68% of the variation in the HER data between the different polymers. The four variables used in the model were the predicted electron affinity, the predicted ionization potential, the optical gap, and the dispersibility of the polymer particles in solution, as measured by optical transmittance.

However, the availability of land to meet these goals is not well understood. Global studies indicate substantial potential, but do not account for local land-use and regional variation, crucial for policy making. Using India as a case study, we use a machine learning framework to define the bioclimatic envelope of forest cover and map this against current land-uses with varying suitability for restoration. We estimate the additional feasible area for restoration to be only 1.58 Mha, cumulatively sequestering 61.3 TgC, which is substantially less than estimates derived from global studies. However, we also find up to 14.67 Mha of opportunity for agroforestry in current agricultural land, delivering up to 98.1 TgC nationally. In the UN Decade of Restoration, we recommend developing forest restoration strategies that are compatible with existing land-uses, such as agroforestry, especially in countries that have large smallholder agriculture holdings.

Radiomics and radiogenomics promise to offer precise diagnosis, predict prognosis, and assess tumour response to modern chemotherapy/immunotherapy and radiation therapy. This is achieved by a triumvirate of morphological, textural, and functional signatures, derived from a high-throughput extraction of quantitative voxel-level MR image metrics. However, the lack of standardisation of acquisition parameters and inconsistent methodology between working groups have made validations unreliable, hence multi-centre studies involving heterogenous study populations are warranted. We elucidate novel radiomic and radiogenomic workflow concepts and state-of-the-art descriptors in sub-visual MR image processing, with relevant literature on applications of such machine learning techniques in glioma management.

There have been various FS methods, but all assume that the cost associated with a feature is precise, which restricts their real applications. Focusing on the FS problem with fuzzy cost, a fuzzy multiobjective FS method with particle swarm optimization, called PSOMOFS, is studied in this article. The proposed method develops a fuzzy dominance relationship to compare the goodness of candidate particles and defines a fuzzy crowding distance measure to prune the elitist archive and determine the global leader of particles. Also, a tolerance coefficient is introduced into the proposed method to ensure that the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained satisfy decision makers' preferences. The developed method is used to tackle a series of the UCI datasets and is compared with three fuzzy multiobjective evolutionary methods and three typical multiobjective FS methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve feature sets with superior performances in approximation, diversity, and feature cost.

We systematically analyzed somatic alterations to provide a comprehensive view of DDR deficiency across 33 cancer types. Mutations with accompanying loss of heterozygosity were observed in over 1/3 of DDR genes, including TP53 and BRCA1/2. Other prevalent alterations included epigenetic silencing of the direct repair genes EXO5, MGMT, and ALKBH3 in similar to 20% of samples. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present at varying frequency in many cancer types, most notably ovarian cancer. However, in contrast to ovarian cancer, HRD was associated with worse outcomes in several other cancers. Protein structurebased analyses allowed us to predict functional consequences of rare, recurrent DDR mutations. A new machine-learning-based classifier developed from gene expression data allowed us to identify alterations that phenocopy deleterious TP53 mutations. These frequent DDR gene alterations in many human cancers have functional consequences that may determine cancer progression and guide therapy.

In the 21 years since our laboratory discovered Scap, we have learned how it binds sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and transports them from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi for proteolytic processing. Proteolysis releases the SREBP transcription factor domains, which enter the nucleus to promote cholesterol synthesis and uptake. When cholesterol in ER membranes exceeds a threshold, the sterol binds to Scap, triggering several conformational changes that prevent the Scap-SREBP complex from leaving the ER. As a result, SREBPs are no longer processed, cholesterol synthesis and uptake are repressed, and cholesterol homeostasis is restored. This review focuses on the four domains of Scap that undergo concerted conformational changes in response to cholesterol binding. The data provide a molecular mechanism for the control of lipids in cell membranes.

DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous system tumours	NATURE			English	Article							CLASS PROBABILITY ESTIMATION; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; MEDULLOBLASTOMA; MULTICENTER; EXPRESSION; SUBGROUPS; COMPRISE; SUBSETS; GLIOMAS	Accurate pathological diagnosis is crucial for optimal management of patients with cancer. For the approximately 100 known tumour types of the central nervous system, standardization of the diagnostic process has been shown to be particularly challengingwith substantial inter-observer variability in the histopathological diagnosis of many tumour types. Here we present a comprehensive approach for the DNA methylation-based classification of central nervous system tumours across all entities and age groups, and demonstrate its application in a routine diagnostic setting. We show that the availability of this method may have a substantial impact on diagnostic precision compared to standard methods, resulting in a change of diagnosis in up to 12% of prospective cases. For broader accessibility, we have designed a free online classifier tool, the use of which does not require any additional onsite data processing. Our results provide a blueprint for the generation of machine-learning-based tumour classifiers across other cancer entities, with the potential to fundamentally transform tumour pathology.

To understand the changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) accompanying transition to IBC, we used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) and a 37-plex antibody staining panel to interrogate 79 clinically annotated surgical resections using machine learning tools for cell segmentation, pixel-based clustering, and object morphometrics. Comparison of normal breast with patient matched DCIS and IBC revealed coordinated transitions between four TME states that were delineated based on the location and function of myoepithelium, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Surprisingly, myoepithelial disruption was more advanced in DCIS patients that did not develop IBC, suggesting this process could be protective against recurrence. Taken together, this HTAN Breast PreCancer Atlas study offers insight into drivers of IBC relapse and emphasizes the importance of the TME in regulating these processes.

We investigated the proteomic profile of extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) in 426 human samples from tissue explants (TEs), plasma, and other bodily fluids. Among traditional exosome markers, CD9, HSPA8, ALIX, and HSP90AB1 represent pan-EVP markers, while ACTB, MSN, and RAP1B are novel pan-EVP markers. To confirm that EVPs are ideal diagnostic tools, we analyzed proteomes of TE- (n =151) and plasma-derived (n =120) EVPs. Comparison of TE EVPs identified proteins (e.g., VCAN, TNC, and THBS2) that distinguish tumors from normal tissues with 90% sensitivity/94% specificity. Machine-learning classification of plasma-derived EVP cargo, including immunoglobulins, revealed 95% sensitivity/90% specificity in detecting cancer Finally, we defined a panel of tumor-type-specific EVP proteins in TEs and plasma, which can classify tumors of unknown primary origin. Thus, EVP proteins can serve as reliable biomarkers for cancer detection and determining cancer type.

Here, we performed proteomic and metabolomic profiling of sera from 46 COVID-19 and 53 control individuals. We then trained a machine learning model using proteomic and metabolomic measurements from a training cohort of 18 non-severe and 13 severe patients. The model was validated using 10 independent patients, 7 of which were correctly classified. Targeted proteomics and metabolomics assays were employed to further validate this molecular classifier in a second test cohort of 19 COVID-19 patients, leading to 16 correct assignments. We identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients compared to other groups implicating dysregulation of macrophage, platelet degranulation, complement system pathways, and massive metabolic suppression. This study revealed characteristic protein and metabolite changes in the sera of severe COVID-19 patients, which might be used in selection of potential blood biomarkers for severity evaluation.

J	Keshk, M; Moustafa, N; Sitnikova, E; Turnbull, B				Keshk, Marwa; Moustafa, Nour; Sitnikova, Elena; Turnbull, Benjamin			Privacy-preserving big data analytics for cyber-physical systems	WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						Privacy preservation; Big data; Independent component analysis; SCADA; CPS; Power system		Cyber-physical systems (CPS) generate big data collected from combining physical and digital entities, but the challenge of CPS privacy-preservation demands further research to protect CPS sensitive information from unauthorized access. Data mining, perturbation, transformation and encryption are techniques extensively used to preserve private information from disclosure whilst still providing insight, but these are limited in their effectiveness in still allowing high-level analysis. This paper studies the role of big data component analysis for protecting sensitive information from illegal access. The independent component analysis (ICA) technique is applied to transform raw CPS information into a new shape whilst preserving its data utility. The mechanism is evaluated using the power CPS dataset, and the results reveal that the technique is more effective than four other privacy-preservation techniques, obtaining a higher level of privacy protection. In addition, the data utility is tested using three machine learning algorithms to estimate their capability of identifying normal and attack patterns before and after transformation.

However, the diversity of software tools and the complexity of analysis pipelines make it difficult to access this field. Here, we systematically summarize the advantages and limitations of microbiome methods. Then, we recommend specific pipelines for amplicon and metagenomic analyses, and describe commonly-used software and databases, to help researchers select the appropriate tools. Furthermore, we introduce statistical and visualization methods suitable for microbiome analysis, including alpha- and beta-diversity, taxonomic composition, difference comparisons, correlation, networks, machine learning, evolution, source tracing, and common visualization styles to help researchers make informed choices. Finally, a step-by-step reproducible analysis guide is introduced. We hope this review will allow researchers to carry out data analysis more effectively and to quickly select the appropriate tools in order to efficiently mine the biological significance behind the data.

J	Wu, YT; Yuan, M; Dong, SP; Lin, L; Liu, YQ				Wu, Yuting; Yuan, Mei; Dong, Shaopeng; Lin, Li; Liu, Yingqi			Remaining useful life estimation of engineered systems using vanilla LSTM neural networks	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Long short-term memory neural network; Remaining useful life estimation; Prognostics and health management; Dynamic differential feature		Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a significant branch of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), capable of learning long-term dependencies. In recent years, vanilla LSTM (a variation of original LSTM above) has become the state-of-the-art model for a variety of machine learning problems, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, in industry, this powerful Deep Neural Network (DNN) has not aroused wide concern. In research focusing on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technology for complex engineered systems, Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation is one of the most challenging problems, which can lead to appropriate maintenance actions to be scheduled proactively to avoid catastrophic failures and minimize economic losses of the systems. Following that, this paper aims to propose utilizing vanilla LSTM neural networks to get good RUL prediction accuracy which makes the most of long short-term memory ability, in the cases of complicated operations, working conditions, model degradations and strong noises. In addition, to promote cognition ability about model degradation processes, a dynamic differential technology was proposed to extract inter-frame information. The whole proposition is illustrated and discussed by performing tests on a case of the health monitoring of aircraft turbofan engines which have four different issues. Performances of vanilla LSTM are benchmarked with standard RNN and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) LSTM. Results show the significance of performance improvement achieved by vanilla LSTM.

In practice, a sufficient number of fault samples are required by the AI methods in the training phase. However, faulty training samples are generally much more difficult to be collected than normal training samples. Data augmentation is introduced in these scenarios to enhance the training data set with synthetic data. In this study, a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) is proposed to diagnose various faults for chillers. A detailed comparative study has been conducted with real-world fault data samples to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology. Note to Practitioners-This work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD). Modern supervised learning chiller AFD relies on a sufficient number of faulty training samples to train the classifier. When the number of faulty training samples is insufficient, the conventional AFD methods fail to work. This study proposed a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) framework for generating synthetic faulty training samples to enrich the training data set for machine learning-based AFD methods. The proposed algorithm has been carefully designed, implemented, and practically proved to be more effective than the existing methods in the literature.

The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP, most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged accuracies are 88.5%, 83.3%, and 84.3% for the three datasets, respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of MI-based BCIs.

Such mental responses stem from physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a noninvasive and nonradioactive solution for emotion identification. Accurate and automatic classification of emotions can boost the development of human-computer interface. This article proposes automatic extraction and classification of features through the use of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs). At first, the proposed method converts the filtered EEG signals into an image using a time-frequency representation. Smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution is used to transform time-domain EEG signals into images. These images are fed to pretrained AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 along with configurable CNN. The performance of four CNNs is evaluated by measuring the accuracy, precision, Mathew's correlation coefficient, F1-score, and false-positive rate. The results obtained by evaluating four CNNs show that configurable CNN requires very less learning parameters with better accuracy. Accuracy scores of 90.98%, 91.91%, 92.71%, and 93.01% obtained by AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, and configurable CNN show that the proposed method is best among other existing methods.

J	Bussi, G; Laio, A				Bussi, Giovanni; Laio, Alessandro			Using metadynamics to explore complex free-energy landscapes	NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS			English	Review							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; RECONSTRUCTION; EFFICIENT; SURFACES; PATHS	Metadynamics is an atomistic simulation technique that allows, within the same framework, acceleration of rare events and estimation of the free energy of complex molecular systems. It is based on iteratively 'filling' the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches. Metadynamics is a technique to enhance the probability of observing rare events, such as chemical reactions and phase transitions, in molecular dynamics simulations. This Technical Review surveys the technique, addressing the critical issues that are met in practical applications. Key pointsMetadynamics makes it possible to accelerate conformational transitions between metastable states, broadening the scope of molecular dynamics simulations.Like other enhanced sampling methods, metadynamics requires the introduction of low-dimensional descriptors (collective variables) whose choice affects the rate at which transitions are enhanced. The ideal collective variable should take different values not only in all the relevant metastable states but also in the transition states between them.The appropriate collective variables can be found by trial and error or designed automatically using methods inspired by machine learning.Two variants of metadynamics are commonly used, namely ordinary and well-tempered metadynamics. The former has the advantage of inducing transitions between the metastable states even if the collective variable is not ideal. The latter has the advantage of providing an exact estimator of the free energy.Metadynamics can be used in combination with most molecular dynamics software packages by taking advantage of dedicated software libraries that implement the method and a large number of collective variables.

Structuro-functional surrogates of response to subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation for depression	BRAIN			English	Article						depression; deep brain stimulation; subcallosal cingulate; magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography	TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; REFRACTORY ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; MAJOR DEPRESSION; FOLLOW-UP; CORTEX; ABNORMALITIES; METAANALYSIS; DISORDER; GYRUS; MOOD	Subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation produces long-term clinical improvement in approximately half of patients with severe treatment-resistant depression. We hypothesized that both structural and functional brain attributes may be important in determining responsiveness to this therapy. In a treatment-resistant depression subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation cohort, we retrospectively examined baseline and longitudinal differences in MRI-derived brain volume (n = 65) and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET glucose metabolism (n = 21) between responders and non-responders. Support vector machines were subsequently trained to classify patients' response status based on extracted baseline imaging features. A machine learning model incorporating preoperative frontopolar, precentral/frontal opercular and orbitofrontal local volume values classified binary response status (12 months) with 83% accuracy [leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV): 80% accuracy] and explained 32% of the variance in continuous clinical improvement. It was also predictive in an out-of-sample subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation cohort (n = 21) with differing primary indications (bipolar disorder/anorexia nervosa; 76% accuracy). Adding preoperative glucose metabolism information from rostral anterior cingulate cortex and temporal pole improved model performance, enabling it to predict response status in the treatment-resistant depression cohort with 86% accuracy (LOOCV: 81% accuracy) and explain 67% of clinical variance. Response-related patterns of metabolic and structural post-deep brain stimulation change were also observed, especially in anterior cingulate cortex and neighbouring white matter. Areas where responders differed from non-responders-both at baseline and longitudinally-largely overlapped with depression-implicated white matter tracts, namely uncinate fasciculus, cingulum bundle and forceps minor/rostrum of corpus callosum. The extent of patient-specific engagement of these same tracts (according to electrode location and stimulation parameters) also served as an independent predictor of treatment-resistant depression response status (72% accuracy; LOOCV: 70% accuracy) and augmented performance of the volume-based (88% accuracy; LOOCV: 82% accuracy) and combined volume/metabolism-based support vector machines (100% accuracy; LOOCV: 94% accuracy). Taken together, these results indicate that responders and non-responders to subcallosal cingulate deep brain stimulation exhibit differences in brain volume and metabolism, both pre- and post-surgery. Moreover, baseline imaging features predict response to treatment (particularly when combined with information about local tract engagement) and could inform future patient selection and other clinical decisions.

The existing approaches mainly focus on enhancing the quality of a single frame, not considering the similarity between consecutive frames. Since heavy fluctuation exists across compressed video frames as investigated in this paper, frame similarity can be utilized for quality enhancement of low-quality frames given their neighboring high-quality frames. This task is Multi-Frame Quality Enhancement (MFQE). Accordingly, this paper proposes an MFQE approach for compressed video, as the first attempt in this direction. In our approach, we first develop a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) based detector to locate Peak Quality Frames (PQFs) in compressed video. Then, a novel Multi-Frame Convolutional Neural Network (MF-CNN) is designed to enhance the quality of compressed video, in which the non-PQF and its nearest two PQFs are the input. In MF-CNN, motion between the non-PQF and PQFs is compensated by a motion compensation subnet. Subsequently, a quality enhancement subnet fuses the non-PQF and compensated PQFs, and then reduces the compression artifacts of the non-PQF. Also, PQF quality is enhanced in the same way. Finally, experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our MFQE approach in advancing the state-of-the-art quality enhancement of compressed video.

Acoustic emission for in situ quality monitoring in additive manufacturing using spectral convolutional neural networks	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						In situ quality monitoring; Acoustic emission; Spectral neural networks; Wavelet transform; Additive manufacturing; Fiber Bragg gratings		Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a new technology that obliterates the geometrical limits of the produced workpieces and promises low running costs as compared to traditional manufacturing methods. Hence, additive manufacturing technology has high expectations in industry. Unfortunately, the lack of a proper quality monitoring prohibits the penetration of this technology into an extensive practice. This work investigates the feasibility of using acoustic emission for quality monitoring and combines a sensitive acoustic emission sensor with machine learning. The acoustic signals were recorded using a fiber Bragg grating sensor during the powder bed additive manufacturing process in a commercially available selective laser melting machine. The process parameters were intentionally tuned to invoke different processing regimes that lead to the formation of different types and concentrations of pores (1.42 +/- 0.85 %, 0.3 +/- 0.18 % and 0.07 +/- 0.02 %) inside the workpiece. According to this poor, medium and high part qualities were defined. The acoustic signals collected during processing were grouped accordingly and divided into two separate datasets; one for the training and one for the testing. The acoustic features were the relative energies of the narrow frequency bands of the wavelet packet transform, extracted from all the signals. The classifier, based on spectral convolutional neural network, was trained to differentiate the acoustic features of dissimilar quality. The confidence in classifications varies between 83 and 89 %. In view of the narrow range of porosity, the results can be considered as promising and they showed the feasibility of the quality monitoring using acoustic emission with the sub-layer spatial resolution.

However, improving the performance of palmprint recognition with insufficient training samples per person is still a challenging task. The undersampling problem limits the application and popularization of palmprint recognition. In this article, by regularly sampling different local regions of the palmprint image, we learn complete and discriminative convolution features by using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). With this powerful palmprint description, a joint constrained least-square regression (JCLSR) framework, which performs representation for each local region of the same palmprint image requiring all regular local regions of the palmprint image to have similar projected target matrices, is presented to exploit the commonality of different patches. The proposed method can well solve the undersampling classification problem in palmprint recognition. Experiments were conducted on the IITD, CASIA, noisy IITD, and PolyU multispectral palmprint databases. It can be seen from the experimental results that the proposed JCLSR consistently outperformed the classical palmprint recognition methods and some subspace learning-based methods for palmprint recognition.

These data file sizes, together with differences in nomenclature among these data types, make the integration of these multi-dimensional omics data into biologically meaningful context challenging. Variously named as integrated omics, multi-omics, poly-omics, trans-omics, pan-omics or shortened to just 'omics', the challenges include differences in data cleaning, normalization, biomolecule identification, data dimensionality reduction, biological contextualization, statistical validation, data storage and handling, sharing and data archiving. The ultimate goal is toward the holistic realization of a 'systems biology' understanding of the biological question. Commonly used approaches are currently limited by the 3 i's - integration, interpretation and insights. Post integration, these very large datasets aim to yield unprecedented views of cellular systems at exquisite resolution for transformative insights into processes, events and diseases through various computational and informatics frameworks. With the continued reduction in costs and processing time for sample analyses, and increasing types of omics datasets generated such as glycomics, lipidomics, microbiomics and phenomics, an increasing number of scientists in this interdisciplinary domain of bioinformatics face these challenges. We discuss recent approaches, existing tools and potential caveats in the integration of omics datasets for development of standardized analytical pipelines that could be adopted by the global omics research community.

The reduction of waste requires a review of the policy of valorizing raw materials by resorting to recycling and reuse as much as possible. In this study, a new membrane-type acoustic metamaterial was developed using a recycled cork membrane and fixing to this membrane masses obtained by reusing thumbtacks and buttons. About 42 samples were packaged by attaching different combinations of masses to the cork membrane. The specimens thus obtained were used to measure the sound absorption coefficient by means of an impedance tube. To improve the acoustic properties of the material, the benefits of membrane resonance absorption and cavity resonance absorption were coupled, leaving a 50 mm cavity at the end of the tube. Subsequently, the measurements were used to train a regression tree-based sound absorption coefficient prediction model. The results obtained suggest using these structures for the acoustic correction of the rooms.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the layer-by-layer nature of AM, parts with complex geometries, integrated assemblies, customized geometry or multifunctional designs can now be manufactured more easily than traditional subtractive manufacturing. Path planning in AM is an important step in the process of manufacturing products. The final fabricated qualities, properties, etc., will be different when using different path strategies, even using the same AM machine and process parameters. Currently, increasing research studies have been published on path planning strategies with different aims. Due to the rapid development of path planning in AM and various newly proposed strategies, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on this topic. Therefore, this paper gives a comprehensive understanding of the current status and challenges of AM path planning. This paper reviews and discusses path planning strategies in three categories: improving printed qualities, saving materials/time and achieving objective printed properties. The main findings of this review include: new path planning strategies can be developed by combining some of the strategies in literature with better performance; a path planning platform can be developed to help select the most suitable path planning strategy with required properties; research on path planning considering energy consumption can be carried out in the future; a benchmark model for testing the performance of path planning strategies can be designed; the trade-off among different fabricated properties can be considered as a factor in future path planning design processes; and lastly, machine learning can be a powerful tool to further improve path planning strategies in the future.

To deal with these issues, we propose a deep neural network which recurrently fuses and refines multi-scale deep features (DeFusionNet) for defocus blur detection. We first fuse the features from different layers of FCN as shallow features and semantic features, respectively. Then, the fused shallow features are propagated to deep layers for refining the details of detected defocus blur regions, and the fused semantic features are propagated to shallow layers to assist in better locating blur regions. The fusion and refinement are carried out recurrently. In order to narrow the gap between low-level and high-level features, we embed a feature adaptation module before feature propagating to exploit the complementary information as well as reduce the contradictory response of different feature layers. Since different feature channels are with different extents of discrimination for detecting blur regions, we design a channel attention module to select discriminative features for feature refinement. Finally, the output of each layer at last recurrent step are fused to obtain the final result.

This paper investigates the history of soil survey in Iran, particularly more recent developments in the use of digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches rather than conventional soil mapping (CSM) methods. A 2000-2019 literature search of articles on DSM of areas of Iran in international journals found 40 studies. These showed an increase in frequency over time, and most were completed in the arid and semi-arid regions of central Iran. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forests (RF), and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MnLR) were the most commonly applied models for predicting soil classes and properties and ANN performed best in most comparative studies. Given the scale of inquiry of most studies (local or regional), quantitative environmental variables such as terrain attributes and remote sensing data were frequently used whereas qualitative variables such as geomorphology, geology, land use, and legacy soil maps were rarely used. The literature review of CSM showed that this method is incapable of defining the spatial distribution of soils and also provides a lower accuracy than DSM method. This review has identified research gaps that need filling. In Iran, coherent national scale DSM with consistent methodology is needed to update legacy soil maps, and to apply DSM in forestlands, hillslopes, deserts, and mountainous regions which have largely been ignored in recent DSM studies. This review should also be useful for producing more local and regional digital soil maps more rapidly as it helps show which covariates and mathematical methods have been best suited to this scale of DSM in Iran.

In the literature, Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms show superior performance in solving this problem. This motivated our attempts to test the performance of the newly proposed Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) in this area. As such, two new wrapper FS approaches that use SSA as the search strategy are proposed. In the first approach, eight transfer functions are employed to convert the continuous version of SSA to binary. In the second approach, the crossover operator is used in addition to the transfer functions to replace the average operator and enhance the exploratory behavior of the algorithm. The proposed approaches are benchmarked on 22 well-known UCI datasets and the results are compared with 5 FS methods: Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (BGWO), Binary Gravitational Search Algorithms (BGSA), Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The paper also considers an extensive study of the parameter setting for the proposed technique. From the results, it is observed that the proposed approach significantly outperforms others on around 90% of the datasets.

This problem is known as spam. By receiving spam messages, Internet users are exposed to security issues, and minors are exposed to inappropriate contents. Moreover, spam messages waste resources in terms of storage, bandwidth, and productivity. What makes the problem worse is that spammers keep inventing new techniques to dodge spam filters. On the other side, the massive data flow of hundreds of millions of individuals, and the large number of attributes make the problem more cumbersome and complex. Therefore, proposing evolutionary and adaptable spam detection models becomes a necessity. In this paper, an intelligent detection system that is based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Weight Network (RWN) is proposed to deal with email spam detection tasks. In addition, an automatic identification capability is also embedded in the proposed system to detect the most relevant features during the detection process. The proposed system is intensively evaluated through a series of extensive experiments based on three email corpora. The experimental results confirm that the proposed system can achieve remarkable results in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Furthermore, the proposed detection system can automatically identify the most relevant features of the spam emails.

Part II: Research Applications	FORESTS			English	Review						UAV; drone; precision forestry; forest management; meta-analysis; inventory parameters; biomass; hyperspectral; machine learning; technology transfer		Forest sustainable management aims to maintain the income of woody goods for companies, together with preserving non-productive functions as a benefit for the community. Due to the progress in platforms and sensors and the opening of the dedicated market, unmanned aerial vehicle-remote sensing (UAV-RS) is improving its key role in the forestry sector as a tool for sustainable management. The use of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in precision forestry has exponentially increased in recent years, as demonstrated by more than 600 references published from 2018 until mid-2020 that were found in the Web of Science database by searching for "UAV" + "forest". This result is even more surprising when compared with similar research for "UAV" + "agriculture", from which emerge about 470 references. This shows how UAV-RS research forestry is gaining increasing popularity. In Part II of this review, analyzing the main findings of the reviewed papers (227), numerous strengths emerge concerning research technical issues. UAV-RS is fully applicated for obtaining accurate information from practical parameters (height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and biomass). Research effectiveness and soundness demonstrate that UAV-RS is now ready to be applied in a real management context. Some critical issues and barriers in transferring research products are also evident, namely, (1) hyperspectral sensors are poorly used, and their novel applications should be based on the capability of acquiring tree spectral signature especially for pest and diseases detection, (2) automatic processes for image analysis are poorly flexible or based on proprietary software at the expense of flexible and open-source tools that can foster researcher activities and support technology transfer among all forestry stakeholders, and (3) a clear lack exist in sensors and platforms interoperability for large-scale applications and for enabling data interoperability.

In this line, satellite images are useful tools that can assist in obtaining soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016-2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8OLI provided the best prediction performances. The SYSIs also had the highest percentage of areas with bare soil pixels (similar to 30-50%) when compared to the single-date images (similar to 20%). Our results suggest that bare soil images obtained by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are more important for soil mapping than spatial or spectral resolutions. Soil maps obtained via satellite images are important tools for soil survey, land planning, management and precision agriculture.

Despite its significant progress in recent years, there are still two challenging issues in the current ensemble clustering research. First, most of the existing algorithms tend to investigate the ensemble information at the object-level, yet often lack the ability to explore the rich information at higher levels of granularity. Second, they mostly focus on the direct connections (e.g., direct intersection or pair-wise co-occurrence) in the multiple base clusterings, but generally neglect the multiscale indirect relationship hidden in them. To address these two issues, this paper presents a novel ensemble clustering approach based on fast propagation of cluster-wise similarities via random walks. We first construct a cluster similarity graph with the base clusters treated as graph nodes and the cluster-wise Jaccard coefficient exploited to compute the initial edge weights. Upon the constructed graph, a transition probability matrix is defined, based on which the random walk process is conducted to propagate the graph structural information. Specifically, by investigating the propagating trajectories starting from different nodes, a new cluster-wise similarity matrix can be derived by considering the trajectory relationship. Then, the newly obtained cluster-wise similarity matrix is mapped from the cluster-level to the object-level to achieve an enhanced co-association matrix, which is able to simultaneously capture the object-wise co-occurrence relationship as well as the multiscale cluster-wise relationship in ensembles.

J	Mousa, MH; Miljkovic, N; Nawaz, K				Mousa, Mohamed H.; Miljkovic, Nenad; Nawaz, Kashif			Review of heat transfer enhancement techniques for single phase flows	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Heat transfer augmentation; Swirl flow; Pressure drop; Passive heat transfer; Active heat transfer; Nusselt number; Friction factor; Twisted tape; Insert; Internal flow; Boundary layer		The thermal energy exchange between a flowing fluid and its confining channel is a ubiquitous process in modern society. To enhance the fluid-to-wall or wall-to-fluid heat transfer, several techniques have been developed to maximize the contact area between the fluid and the inner wall and/or disrupt the flow to enhance circulation or induce turbulence. Deployment of channels having features capable of enhancing heat transfer enables the reduction of heat exchanger size while maintaining performance. Reduction in equipment size is critical due to the ability to minimize the required volume of costly working fluids and to mitigate potential safety concerns associated with total system fluid volume. Here, a comprehensive review of single-phase heat transfer enhancement techniques is presented. The article provides a thorough comparison by analyzing the heat transfer rate, pressure drop, and other operational aspects. Single-phase heat transfer enhancement methods are divided into active and passive techniques. Active methods such as electrohydrodynamic (EHD), magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), or mechanical motion require external power to create enhancement. Passive methods such as dimples, fins, or tape inserts do not require external input and rely only on surface modification. Although active methods are more expensive and difficult to implement compared to passive techniques, it enables active control of heat transfer augmentation. This review develops and summarizes key learning data for design optimization enabled by additive manufacturing and machine learning algorithms, helping to inform these next-generation heat exchanger design methodologies for a plethora of modern applications such as electrification of vehicles, computing, and classical industries.

For this purpose, an ever-increasing amount of data has to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Still, a major part of these activities is performed manually, which requires high investments in various resources. To support these processes more efficiently, this article presents an artificial-intelligence-based data mining model that helps firms spot emerging topics and trends at a higher level of automation than before. Its modular structure consists of components for query generation, data collection, data preprocessing, topic modeling, topic analysis, and visualization, combined in such a way that only a minimum amount of manual effort is required during its initial set up. The approach also incorporates self-adaptive capabilities, allowing the model to automatically update itself once new data has become available. The model parameterization is based on latest research in this area, and its threshold parameter is learnt during supervised training using a training data set. We have applied our model to an independent test data set to verify its effectiveness as an early warning system. By means of a retrospective analysis, we show in three case studies that our model is able to identify emerging technologies prior to their first publication in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies. Based on our findings, we derive both theoretical and practical implications for the technology and innovation management of firms, and we suggest future research opportunities to further advance this field.

Event cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution (in the order of mu s), very high dynamic range (140 dB versus 60 dB), low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision in challenging scenarios for traditional cameras, such as low-latency, high speed, and high dynamic range. However, novel methods are required to process the unconventional output of these sensors in order to unlock their potential. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of event-based vision, with a focus on the applications and the algorithms developed to unlock the outstanding properties of event cameras. We present event cameras from their working principle, the actual sensors that are available and the tasks that they have been used for, from low-level vision (feature detection and tracking, optic flow, etc.) to high-level vision (reconstruction, segmentation, recognition). We also discuss the techniques developed to process events, including learning-based techniques, as well as specialized processors for these novel sensors, such as spiking neural networks. Additionally, we highlight the challenges that remain to be tackled and the opportunities that lie ahead in the search for a more efficient, bio-inspired way for machines to perceive and interact with the world.

Water resources that are naturally available beneath the surface are capable of reversing this condition. Spatial modeling of groundwater distribution is an important undertaking that would aid in subsequent conservation and management of groundwater resources. In this study, groundwater potential maps were developed using a machine learning algorithm (MLA) and a deep learning algorithm (DLA), specifically the support vector regression (SVR) and convolution neural network (CNN) functions, respectively. Initially, 140 groundwater datasets were created through an extensive survey and then arbitrarily divided into groups of 100 (70%) and 40 (30%) datasets for model calibration and testing, respectively. Next, 15 groundwater conditioning factors (GCFs), including catchment area (CA), convergence index (CI), convexity (Co), diurnal anisotropic heating (DH), flow path (FP), slope angle (SA), slope height (SH), topographic position index (TPI), terrain ruggedness index (TRI), slope length (LS) factor, mass balance index (MBI), texture (TX), valley depth (VD), land cover (LC), and geology (GG) were produced and applied for model training. Finally, the calibrated model was validated using both training and testing data, and the independent measure of the receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC). For validation using training data, the AUC values of CNN and SVR were 0.844 and 0.75, whereas those of CNN and SVR during validation with the testing data were 0.843 and 0.75. Therefore, CNN has better predictive ability than SVR. The findings of this study will help policymakers develop better strategies for conservation and management of groundwater resources.

In the era of big data, various data-driven methods, which are mainly based on deep learning (DL), have been applied in the field of fault diagnosis. As a common deep learning method, convolutional neural networks play an important role in the field of image classification. To take advantage of existing research results of convolutional neural networks that were originally designed for images, short-time Fourier transform is applied to convert signals to two-dimensional graphs. However, the traditional convolutional neural network with max-pooling layers may disregard the positional relationship between features. Inspired by dynamic routing capsule net, a novel capsule network with an inception block and a regression branch is proposed. First, during the preprocessing stage, the one-dimensional signals are transformed into a time-frequency graph. Second, the graph data are fed into the network, and two convolution layers are applied to extract higher information; following that, an inception block is applied to the output feature maps to improve the nonlinearity of the capsule. Then, after dynamic routing, the lengths of the capsules are used to classify the fault category. There are two other branches: one uses the longest capsule to regress the damage size of the capsule, and the other reconstructs the input graph. To verify the generalization ability of the proposed model, comparisons among the proposed model, conventional methods and state-of-the-art convolutional neural network models are carried out.

Although most ANN hardware systems are electronic-based, their optical implementation is particularly attractive because of its intrinsic parallelism and low energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate a fully functioning all-optical neural network (AONN), in which linear operations are programmed by spatial light modulators and Fourier lenses, while nonlinear optical activation functions are realized in laser-cooled atoms with electromagnetically induced transparency. Because all errors from different optical neurons are independent, it is possible to scale up the size of such an AONN. Moreover, our hardware system is reconfigurable for different applications without the need to modify the physical structure.

Determining cell type abundance and expression from bulk tissues with digital cytometry	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RNA-SEQUENCING DATA; GENE-EXPRESSION; TUMOR SAMPLES; DECONVOLUTION; SIGNATURES; CANCER; MICRODISSECTION; CLASSIFICATION; VACCINATION; CHALLENGES	Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.

We processed two archetypal EEG databases, Freiburg (intracranial EEG) and CHB-MIT (scalp EEG), to find if our model could outperform the state-of-the art models. Four key components define our model: (1) multiscale principal component analysis for EEG de-noising, (2) EEG signal decomposition using either empirical mode decomposition, discrete wavelet transform or wavelet packet decomposition, (3) statistical measures to extract relevant features, (4) machine learning algorithms. Our model achieved overall accuracy of 100% in ictal vs. inter-ictal EEG for both databases. In seizure onset prediction, it could discriminate between inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal EEG with the accuracy of 99.77%, and between inter-ictal and pre-ictal EEG states with the accuracy of 99.70%. The proposed model is general and should prove applicable to other classification tasks including detection and prediction regarding bio-signals such as EMG and ECG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

SB capsule endoscopy (SB-CE) is the currently accepted diagnostic procedure. The aim of this study was to develop a computer-assisted diagnosis tool for the detection of GIA. Methods: Deidentified SB-CE still frames featuring annotated typical GIA and normal control still frames were selected from a database. A semantic segmentation images approach associated with a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for deep-feature extractions and classification. Two datasets of still frames were created and used for machine learning and for algorithm testing. Results: The GIA detection algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 96%, a positive predictive value of 96%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. Reproducibility was optimal. The reading process for an entire SB-CE video would take 39 minutes. Conclusions: The developed CNN-based algorithm had high diagnostic performances, allowing detection of GIA in SB-CE still frames. This study paves the way for future automated CNN-based SB-CE reading softwares.

Previously, we developed miRTarBase which provides information about experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions (MTIs). Here, we describe an updated database containing 422 517 curated MTIs from 4076 miRNAs and 23 054 target genes collected from over 8500 articles. The number of MTIs curated by strong evidence has increased similar to 1.4-fold since the last update in 2016. In this updated version, target sites validated by reporter assay that are available in the literature can be downloaded. The target site sequence can extract new features for analysis via a machine learning approach which can help to evaluate the performance of miRNA-target prediction tools. Furthermore, different ways of browsing enhance user browsing specific MTIs. With these improvements, miRTarBase serves as more comprehensively annotated, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions databases in the field of miRNA related research. miRTarBase is available at http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.

The transistor channel, formed by an electropolymerized conducting polymer, can be formed, modulated, and obliterated in situ and under operation. Enduring changes in channel conductance, analogous to long-term potentiation and depression, are attained by electropolymerization and electrochemical overoxidation of the channel material, respectively. Transient changes in channel conductance, analogous to short-term potentiation and depression, are accomplished by inducing nonequilibrium doping states within the transistor channel. By manipulating the input signal, the strength of the transistor response to a given stimulus can be modulated within a range that spans several orders of magnitude, producing behavior that is directly comparable to short- and long-term neuroplasticity. The evolvable transistor is further incorporated into a simple circuit that mimics classical conditioning.

Therefore, energy efficiency becomes a significant requirement for routing protocol design. Recent research introduces data fusion to conserve energy; however, many of them do not present a concrete scheme for the fusion process. Emerging machine learning technology provides a novel direction for data fusion and makes it more available and intelligent. In this article, we present an intelligent data gathering schema with data fusion called IDGS-DF. In IDGS-DF, we adopt a neural network to conduct data fusion to improve network performance. First, we partition the whole sensor fields into several subdomains by virtual grids. Then cluster heads are selected according to the score of nodes and data fusion is conducted in CHs using a pretrained neural network. Finally, a mobile agent is adopted to gather information along a predefined path. Plenty of experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our schema can efficiently conserve energy and enhance the lifetime of the network.

They biotransform food components and produce metabolites, which in combination with food components shape and modulate the host immune system and metabolic responses. Reciprocally, the diet modulates the composition and functional capacity of the gut microbiota, which subsequently influence host biochemical processes establishing a system of mutual interaction and inter-dependency. Macronutrients, fibers, as well as polyphenols and prebiotics are strong drivers shaping the composition of the gut microbiota. Especially, short-chain fatty acids produced from ingested fibers and tryptophan metabolites are key in modulating host immune responses. Since reciprocal interactions between diet, host, and microbiota are personal, understanding this complex network of interactions calls for novel use of large datasets and the implementation of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. In this review, we aim to provide a base for future investigations of how interactions between food components and gut microbiota may influence or even determine human health and disease.

To this end, hybrid machine learning combines the SVR model and grid search (GS), namely, the GS-SVR model was proposed to predict the compressive strength of concrete and sensitivity analysis in this work. The hybrid model was trained and tested on a total of 98 datasets retrieved from literature, and the model performance was compared with the original SVR model under the same datasets. The obtained results in terms of R of 0.981, MSE of 3.44, RMSE of 1.85, MAE of 1.17, and MAPE of 0.05 demonstrate that the GS-SVR model proposed can be a candidate method for compressive strength prediction in subsequent related studies. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to conveniently provide some initial estimates of the outcomes before performing extensive laboratory or fieldwork. Finally, the effect of each variable on the compressive strength in a random environment was analyzed.

Recent studies have shown that methylation has been widely identified in different RNA molecules. RNA methylation modifications have various kinds, such as 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C). However, for individual methylation sites, their functions still remain to be elucidated. Testing of all methylation sites relies heavily on high-throughput sequencing technology, which is expensive and labor consuming. Thus, computational prediction approaches could serve as a substitute. In this study, multiple machine learning models were used to predict possible RNA m(5)C sites on the basis of mRNA sequences in human and mouse. Each site was represented by several features derived from k-mers of an RNA subsequence containing such site as center. The powerful max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR) feature selection method was employed to analyse these features. The outcome feature list was fed into incremental feature selection method, incorporating four classification algorithms, to build efficient models. Furthermore, the sites related to features used in the models were also investigated.

This paper utilizes two variable importance analysis methods to identify the relative importance of different geographic factors to explain the spatial distribution of poverty: the Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold (LMG) method used in multiple linear regression (MLR) and variable importance used in random forest (RF) machine learning. A case study was conducted in Yunyang, a poverty-stricken county in China, to evaluate the performances of the two methods for identifying village-level poverty determinants. The results indicated that: (1) MLR and RF had similar explanation accuracy; (2) LMG and RF were consistent in the three main determinants of poverty; (3) LMG better identified the importance of variables that were highly related to poverty but correlated with other variables, while RF better identified the non-linear relationships between poverty and explanatory variables; (4) accessibility metrics are the most important variables influencing poverty in Yunyang and have a linear relationship with poverty.

Such settings necessitate the use of methods for derivative-free, or zeroth-order, optimization. We provide a review and perspectives on developments in these methods, with an emphasis on high-lighting recent developments and on unifying treatment of such problems in the non-linear optimization and machine learning literature. We categorize methods based on assumed properties of the black-box functions, as well as features of the methods. We first overview the primary setting of deterministic methods applied to unconstrained, non-convex optimization problems where the objective function is defined by a deterministic black-box oracle. We then discuss developments in randomized methods, methods that assume some additional structure about the objective (including convexity, separability and general non-smooth compositions), methods for problems where the output of the black-box oracle is stochastic, and methods for handling different types of constraints.

Among these FDD methods, data-driven designs, that can be directly implemented without a logical or mathematical description of traction systems, have received special attention because of their overwhelming advantages. Based on the existing data-driven FDD methods for traction systems in high-speed trains, the first objective of this paper is to systematically review and categorize most of the mainstream methods. By analyzing the characteristic of observations from sensors equipped in traction systems, great challenges which may prevent successful FDD implementations on practical high-speed trains are then summarized in detail. Benefiting from theoretical developments of data-driven FDD strategies, instructive perspectives on this topic are further elaborately conceived by the integration of model-based FDD issues, system identification techniques, and new machine learning tools, which provide several promising solutions to FDD strategies for traction systems in high-speed trains.

The immense advancements in this field urged the researchers to devise new techniques and approaches, each sermonizing a different research analysis/question, that cope with upcoming issues and complex scenarios of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. Therefore, this survey emphasized on the issues and challenges that are related to extraction of different aspects and their relevant sentiments, relational mapping between aspects, interactions, dependencies, and contextual-semantic relationships between different data objects for improved sentiment accuracy, and prediction of sentiment evolution dynamicity. A rigorous overview of the recent progress is summarized based on whether they contributed towards highlighting and mitigating the issue of Aspect Extraction, Aspect Sentiment Analysis or Sentiment Evolution. The reported performance for each scrutinized study of Aspect Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Analysis is also given, showing the quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach. Future research directions are proposed and discussed, by critically analysing the presented recent solutions, that will be helpful for researchers and beneficial for improving sentiment classification at aspect-level.

Considering the overall spectra and adjacent band correlations of objects, the PCA and SPCA methods are utilized first for spectral dimension reduction, respectively. Then, multiscale 2-D-SSA is applied onto the SPCA dimension-reduced images to extract abundant spatial features at different scales, where PCA is applied again for dimensionality reduction. The obtained multiscale spatial features are then fused with the global spectral features derived from PCA to form multiscale spectral-spatial features (MSF-PCs). The performance of the extracted MSF-PCs is evaluated using the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments on four benchmark HSI data sets have shown that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods, including several deep learning approaches, when only a small number of training samples are available.

What social media told us in the time of COVID-19: a scoping review	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Review							SENTIMENT; TWITTER; HEALTH; CORONAVIRUS; IMPACT; OUTBREAK; INSIGHTS; TWEETS; CHINA; WUHAN	With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has rapidly become a crucial communication tool for information generation, dissemination, and consumption. In this scoping review, we selected and examined peer-reviewed empirical studies relating to COVID-19 and social media during the first outbreak from November, 2019, to November, 2020. From an analysis of 81 studies, we identified five overarching public health themes concerning the role of online social media platforms and COVID-19. These themes focused on: surveying public attitudes, identifying infodemics, assessing mental health, detecting or predicting COVID-19 cases, analysing government responses to the pandemic, and evaluating quality of health information in prevention education videos. Furthermore, our Review emphasises the paucity of studies on the application of machine learning on data from COVID-19-related social media and a scarcity of studies documenting real-time surveillance that was developed with data from social media on COVID-19. For COVID-19, social media can have a crucial role in disseminating health information and tackling infodemics and misinformation.

As a result of this monitoring, large amounts of data are routinely collected for these patients. Philips Healthcare has developed a telehealth system, the eICU Program, which leverages these data to support management of critically ill patients. Here we describe the eICU Collaborative Research Database, a multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) database with high granularity data for over 200,000 admissions to ICUs monitored by eICU Programs across the United States. The database is deidentified, and includes vital sign measurements, care plan documentation, severity of illness measures, diagnosis information, treatment information, and more. Data are publicly available after registration, including completion of a training course in research with human subjects and signing of a data use agreement mandating responsible handling of the data and adhering to the principle of collaborative research. The freely available nature of the data will support a number of applications including the development of machine learning algorithms, decision support tools, and clinical research.

Due to climate change and sea level rise, sustainable management of coastal areas involves extensive exploration, monitoring, and protection. Current high-resolution remote sensing methods for monitoring these areas include bathymetric LiDAR. Therefore, this study presents a novel methodological approach to assess the suitability of Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry for automatic classification and mapping of the seafloor. Nine classes of geomorphological bedforms and three classes of anthropogenic structures were identified. They were auto-matically mapped by Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis and machine learning supervised classifiers. The developed method was applied to six study sites and a 48 km submerged coastal zone in the Southern Baltic, achieving an overall accuracy of up to 94%. This study shows that calculation of the Multiresolution Index of Ridge Top Flatness (secondary feature) can be used to quickly and automatically determine sandbar crests and ridge tops. The methodical approach developed in this study can help evaluate and protect other shallow coastal environments and coastal protection structures.

Limited understanding of adsorption mechanisms and scaling up evaluation are the two main obstacles. To fully realize the practical use of NAs for metal removal, we review the advanced tools and chemical principles to identify mechanisms, highlight the importance of adsorption capacity and kinetics on engineering design, and propose a systematic engineering scenario for full-scale NA implementation. Specifically, we provide in-depth insight for using density functional theory (DFT) and/or X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) to elucidate adsorption mechanisms in terms of active site verification and molecular interaction configuration. Furthermore, we discuss engineering issues for designing, scaling, and operating NA systems, including adsorption modeling, reactor selection, and NA regeneration, recovery, and disposal. This review also prioritizes research needs for (i) determining NA microstructure properties using DFT, XAFS, and machine learning and (ii) recovering NAs from treated water. Our critical review is expected to guide and advance the development of highly efficient NAs for engineering applications.

Recent work on silicon-based asynchronous spiking neural networks and large crossbar arrays of two-terminal memristive devices has led to the development of promising neuromorphic systems. However, delivering a compact and efficient parallel computing technology that is capable of embedding artificial neural networks in hardware remains a significant challenge. Organic electronic materials offer an attractive option for such systems and could provide biocompatible and relatively inexpensive neuromorphic devices with low-energy switching and excellent tunability. Here, we review the development of organic neuromorphic devices. We consider different resistance-switching mechanisms, which typically rely on electrochemical doping or charge trapping, and report approaches that enhance state retention and conductance tuning. We also discuss the challenges the field faces in implementing low-power neuromorphic computing, such as device downscaling and improving device speed. Finally, we highlight early demonstrations of device integration into arrays, and consider future directions and potential applications of this technology.

Emerging applications range from fundamental life-science and drug assessment research to point-of-care diagnostics and precision medicine. Recently, novel chip designs and data analytic strategies are laying the foundation for multiparametric cell characterization and subpopulation distinction, which are essential to understand biological function, follow disease progression and monitor cell behaviour in microsystems. In this tutorial review, we present a comparative survey of the approaches to elucidate cellular and subcellular features from impedance cytometry data, covering the related subjects of device design, data analytics (i.e., signal processing, dielectric modelling, population clustering), and phenotyping applications. We give special emphasis to the exciting recent developments of the technique (timeframe 2017-2020) and provide our perspective on future challenges and directions. Its synergistic application with microfluidic separation, sensor science and machine learning can form an essential tool-kit for label-free quantification and isolation of subpopulations to stratify heterogeneous biosystems.

This task permits to extract the most representative information of high sized pools of data, reducing the computational effort in other tasks as classification. This article presents a hybrid optimization method for the FS problem; it combines the slap swarm algorithm (SSA) with the particle swarm optimization. The hybridization between both approaches creates an algorithm called SSAPSO, in which the efficacy of the exploration and the exploitation steps is improved. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, it is tested over two experimental series, in the first one, it is compared with other similar approaches using benchmark functions. Meanwhile, in the second set of experiments, the SSAPSO is used to determine the best set of features using different UCI datasets. Where the redundant or the confusing features are removed from the original dataset while keeping or yielding a better accuracy. The experimental results provide the evidence of the enhancement in the SSAPSO regarding the performance and the accuracy without affecting the computational effort.

Like mammalian olfaction, a larger number of sensors and more signal processing are crucial for strengthening artificial olfaction. Due to rapid progress in computing capabilities and machine-learning algorithms, on-demand high-performance artificial olfaction that can eclipse human olfaction becomes inevitable once diverse and versatile gas sensing materials are provided. Here, rational strategies to design a myriad of different semiconductor-based chemiresistors and to grow gas sensing libraries enough to identify a wide range of odors and gases are reviewed, discussed, and suggested. Key approaches include the use of p-type oxide semiconductors, multinary perovskite and spinel oxides, carbon-based materials, metal chalcogenides, their heterostructures, as well as heterocomposites as distinctive sensing materials, the utilization of bilayer sensor design, the design of robust sensing materials, and the high-throughput screening of sensing materials. In addition, the state-of-the-art and key issues in the implementation of electronic noses are discussed. Finally, a perspective on chemiresistive sensing materials for next-generation artificial olfaction is provided.

This calls for a precise understanding of knowledge management (KM) processes and, specifically, how knowledge is created, shared/transferred, acquired, stored/retrieved, and applied throughout an organizational system. However, since the beginning of the new millennium, such KM processes have been deeply affected and molded by the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, also called Industry 4.0, which involves the interconnectedness of machines and their ability to learn and share data autonomously. For this reason, the present article investigates the intellectual structure and trends of KM in Industry 4.0. Bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review are conducted on a total of 90 relevant articles. The results reveal six clusters of keywords, subsequently explored via a systematic literature review to identify potential stream of this emergent field and future research avenues capable of producing meaningful advances in managerial knowledge of Industry 4.0 and its consequences.

They represent a morphologically heterogeneous class of tumours and some entities lack defining histopathological features. Therefore, the diagnosis of sarcomas is burdened with a high inter-observer variability and misclassification rate. Here, we demonstrate classification of soft tissue and bone tumours using a machine learning classifier algorithm based on array-generated DNA methylation data. This sarcoma classifier is trained using a dataset of 1077 methylation profiles from comprehensively pre-characterized cases comprising 62 tumour methylation classes constituting a broad range of soft tissue and bone sarcoma subtypes across the entire age spectrum. The performance is validated in a cohort of 428 sarcomatous tumours, of which 322 cases were classified by the sarcoma classifier. Our results demonstrate the potential of the DNA methylation-based sarcoma classification for research and future diagnostic applications. Sarcomas are morphologically heterogeneous tumours rendering their classification challenging. Here the authors developed a classifier using DNA methylation data from several soft tissue and bone sarcoma subtypes, which has the potential to improve classification for research and clinical purposes.

Predictable and precise template-free CRISPR editing of pathogenic variants	NATURE			English	Article							GENOMIC DNA; REPAIR; CLONING; BASE; GENE	Following Cas9 cleavage, DNA repair without a donor template is generally considered stochastic, heterogeneous and impractical beyond gene disruption. Here, we show that template-free Cas9 editing is predictable and capable of precise repair to a predicted genotype, enabling correction of disease-associated mutations in humans. We constructed a library of 2,000 Cas9 guide RNAs paired with DNA target sites and trained inDelphi, a machine learning model that predicts genotypes and frequencies of 1-to 60-base-pair deletions and 1-base-pair insertions with high accuracy (r = 0.87) in five human and mouse cell lines. inDelphi predicts that 5-11% of Cas9 guide RNAs targeting the human genome are 'precise-50', yielding a single genotype comprising greater than or equal to 50% of all major editing products. We experimentally confirmed precise-50 insertions and deletions in 195 human disease-relevant alleles, including correction in primary patient-derived fibroblasts of pathogenic alleles to wild-type genotype for Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and Menkes disease. This study establishes an approach for precise, template-free genome editing.

We carried out proteomic profiling of plasma from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed clinical data from our health system database of more than 3300 patients. Using a machine learning algorithm, we identified a prominent signature of neutrophil activation, including resistin, lipocalin-2, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which were the strongest predictors of critical illness. Evidence of neutrophil activation was present on the first day of hospitalization in patients who would only later require transfer to the intensive care unit, thus preceding the onset of critical illness and predicting increased mortality. In the health system database, early elevations in developing and mature neutrophil counts also predicted higher mortality rates.

The microstructure and properties of the components vary widely depending on printing process and process parameters, and prediction of causative variables that affect structure, properties and defects is helpful for their control. Since models are most useful when they can correctly predict experimental observations, we focus on the available mechanistic models of AM that have been adequately validated. Specifically, the applications of transport phenomena models in the studies of solidification, residual stresses, distortion, formation of defects and the evolution of microstructure and properties are critically reviewed. The functionality of AM models in understanding of the printability of commonly used AM alloys and the fabrication of functionally graded alloys are also assessed. Opportunities for future research are identified considering the gaps in knowledge in modeling. The uniqueness of this review includes substantive discussions of the rapid certification of the AM components aided by scale models, bidirectional models, cloud based big data, machine learning and digital twins of AM hardware.

Here we present a novel machine-learning method called REGENIE for fitting a whole-genome regression model for quantitative and binary phenotypes that is substantially faster than alternatives in multi-trait analyses while maintaining statistical efficiency. The method naturally accommodates parallel analysis of multiple phenotypes and requires only local segments of the genotype matrix to be loaded in memory, in contrast to existing alternatives, which must load genome-wide matrices into memory. This results in substantial savings in compute time and memory usage. We introduce a fast, approximate Firth logistic regression test for unbalanced case-control phenotypes. The method is ideally suited to take advantage of distributed computing frameworks. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of this approach using the UK Biobank dataset with up to 407,746 individuals. REGENIE is a whole-genome regression method based on ridge regression that enables highly parallelized analysis of quantitative and binary traits in biobank-scale data with reduced computational requirements.

Variational quantum state diagonalization	NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION			English	Article							ALGORITHMS	Variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are promising candidates for near-term implementation on quantum computers. In these algorithms, a quantum computer evaluates the cost of a gate sequence (with speedup over classical cost evaluation), and a classical computer uses this information to adjust the parameters of the gate sequence. Here we present such an algorithm for quantum state diagonalization. State diagonalization has applications in condensed matter physics (e.g., entanglement spectroscopy) as well as in machine learning (e.g., principal component analysis). For a quantum state rho and gate sequence U, our cost function quantifies how far U rho U-dagger is from being diagonal. We introduce short-depth quantum circuits to quantify our cost. Minimizing this cost returns a gate sequence that approximately diagonalizes rho. One can then read out approximations of the largest eigenvalues, and the associated eigenvectors, of rho. As a proof-of-principle, we implement our algorithm on Rigetti's quantum computer to diagonalize one-qubit states and on a simulator to find the entanglement spectrum of the Heisenberg model ground state.

J	Wang, CZ; Huang, Y; Shao, MW; Fan, XD				Wang, Changzhong; Huang, Yang; Shao, Mingwen; Fan, Xiaodong			Fuzzy rough set-based attribute reduction using distance measures	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Attribute reduction; Distance measure; Fuzzy rough set; Fuzzy similarity relation; Iterative computation	FEATURE-SELECTION; UNCERTAINTY MEASURES; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM	Attribute reduction is one of the most important applications of fuzzy rough sets in machine learning and pattern recognition. Most existing methods employ the intersection operation of fuzzy relations to construct the dependency function of attribute reduction. However, the intersection operation may lead to low discrimination of fuzzy decision in high-dimensional data space. In this study, we introduce distance measures into fuzzy rough sets and propose a novel method for attribute reduction. We first construct a fuzzy rough set model based on distance measure with a fixed parameter. Then, the fixed distance parameter is replaced by a variable one to better characterize attribute reduction with fuzzy rough sets. Some iterative formulas for computing fuzzy rough dependency and attribute significance are presented, and an iterative computation model based on a variable distance parameter is proposed, Based on this, a greedy convergent algorithm for attribute reduction is designed. The experimental comparison demonstrates that the proposed reduction algorithm is effective and performs better than some of the other existing algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The adoption of this technology has ushered a new wave of oncology studies across a wide range of applications including its use in molecular classification, oncogenic pathway analysis, drug and biomarker discovery and unravelling mechanisms of therapy response and resistance. In this review, we provide an overview of the experimental workflows commonly used in DIA-MS, including its current strengths and limitations versus conventional data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry (DDA-MS). We further summarise a number of key studies to illustrate the power of this technology when applied to different facets of oncology. Finally we offer a perspective of the latest innovations in DIA-MS technology and machine learning-based algorithms necessary for driving the development of high-throughput, in-depth and reproducible proteomic assays that are compatible with clinical diagnostic workflows, which will ultimately enable the delivery of precision cancer medicine to achieve optimal patient outcomes.

Gradient-based optimizer (GBO) is a recently developed metaheuristic with population-based characteristics inspired by gradient-based Newton's method that uses two main operators: the gradient search rule (GSR), the local escape operator (LEO) and a set of vectors to explore the search space for solving continuous problems. This article presents a binary GBO (BGBO) algorithm and for feature selecting problems. The eight independent GBO variants are proposed, and eight transfer functions divided into two families of S-shaped and V-shaped are evaluated to map the search space to a discrete space of research. To verify the performance of the proposed binary GBO algorithm, 18 well-known UCI datasets and 10 high-dimensional datasets are tested and compared with other advanced FS methods. The experimental results show that among the proposed binary GBO algorithms has the best comprehensive performance and has better performance than other well known metaheuristic algorithms in terms of the performance measures.

In the current era of big data, the application of image retrieval technology for large-scale data is a popular research area. To ensure the robustness and security of digital image watermarking, we propose a novel algorithm using synergetic neural networks. The algorithm first processes a meaningful gray watermark image, then embeds it as a watermark signal into the block Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) component. The companion algorithm for detection and extraction of the watermark uses a cooperative neural network, where the suspected watermark signal is used as the input while the output consists in the result of the recognition process. The simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete certain image processing operations with improved performance, not only simultaneously completing watermark detection and extraction, but also efficiently determining the watermark attribution.

Genome-Based Prediction of Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Review						antibiotic resistance; genome-based prediction	ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA; KLEBSIELLA-PNEUMONIAE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; REAL-TIME; SUSCEPTIBILITY; GENES	Clinical microbiology has long relied on growing bacteria in culture to determine antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, but the use of whole-genome sequencing for antibiotic susceptibility testing (WGS-AST) is now a powerful alternative. This review discusses the technologies that made this possible and presents results from recent studies to predict resistance based on genome sequences. We examine differences between calling antibiotic resistance profiles by the simple presence or absence of previously known genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) against approaches that deploy machine learning and statistical models. Often, the limitations to genome-based prediction arise from limitations of accuracy of culture-based AST in addition to an incomplete knowledge of the genetic basis of resistance. However, we need to maintain phenotypic testing even as genome-based prediction becomes more widespread to ensure that the results do not diverge over time. We argue that standardization of WGS-AST by challenge with consistently phenotyped strain sets of defined genetic diversity is necessary to compare the efficacy of methods of prediction of antibiotic resistance based on genome sequences.

ORA (overrepresentation analysis), FCS (functional class scoring), and PT (pathway topology) approaches are three generations of GSE methods along the timeline of development. Previous versions of KOBAS provided services based on just the ORA method. Here we presented version 3.0 of KOBAS, which is named KOBAS-i (short for KOBAS intelligent version). It introduced a novel machine learning-based method we published earlier, CGPS, which incorporates seven FCS tools and two PT tools into a single ensemble score and intelligently prioritizes the relevant biological pathways. In addition, KOBAS has expanded the downstream exploratory visualization for selecting and understanding the enriched results. The tool constructs a novel view of cirFunMap, which presents different enriched terms and their correlations in a landscape. Finally, based on the previous version's framework, KOBAS increased the number of supported species from 1327 to 5944. For an easier local run, it also provides a prebuilt Docker image that requires no installation, as a supplementary to the source code version.

Herein, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled variable selected regression methods have been proposed as simple and rapid TBZ quantification technique. The nonlinear correlation between the TBZ and SERS data was first diagnosed by augmented partial residual plots method and calculated by runs test. Au@Ag NPs with strong enhancement factor (EF = 4.07 x 10(6)) of Raman signal was used as SERS active material to collect spectra from TBZ. Subsequently, three nonlinear regression models were comparatively investigated and the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling-extreme learning machine (CARS-ELM) achieved a higher correlation coefficient (Rp(2) = 0.9406) and the lower root-mean-square-error of prediction (RMSEP = 0.5233 mg/L). Finally, recoveries of TBZ in apple samples were 83.02-93.54% with relative standard deviation (RSD) value < 10%. Therefore, SERS coupled CARS-ELM could be employed as a rapid and sensitive approach for TBZ detection in Fuji apples.

J	Bergmeir, C; Hyndman, RJ; Koo, B				Bergmeir, Christoph; Hyndman, Rob J.; Koo, Bonsoo			A note on the validity of cross-validation for evaluating autoregressive time series prediction	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Cross-validation; Time series; Autoregression		One of the most widely used standard procedures for model evaluation in classification and regression is K-fold cross-validation (CV). However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potentialnon-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K-fold CV is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where CV can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.

J	Han, HM; Shi, B; Zhang, L				Han, Heming; Shi, Bin; Zhang, Lei			Prediction of landslide sharp increase displacement by SVM with considering hysteresis of groundwater change	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Landslide; Sharp increase of displacement; Displacement prediction; SVC-PSO-SVR; Hysteresis of groundwater change		The displacement-time curves of reservoir landslide mostly show step-by-step growth characteristics. The sharp increase of the displacement plays a significant role in the evolution process of the step-like landslide, so it is extremely important to accurately predict the suddenly change displacement of landslide. In order to overcome the shortcomings existed in the current displacement monitoring methods and prediction models for the mutation displacement of landslide, this paper proposed a hybrid machine learning displacement prediction model based on Support Vector Machine, including Support Vector Classification(SVC) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (SVC-PSO-SVR) and considering the hysteresis of groundwater level change. The Majiagou No. 1 Landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) Area, whose deformation shows typical step-by-step tendency, was illustrated. Base on the deep displacement data of Majiagou landslide from January 2016 to December 2017, the landslide deformation pattern can be divided into two states: stability and acceleration. Firstly, the SVC model was adopted to predict the time range of acceleration state. Then, considering the lag fluctuation of groundwater level, the concept of "equivalent reservoir level" was proposed. Finally, based on SVC model, the sharp increase displacement of landslide was predicted using PSO-SVR model. The proposed SVC-PSO-SVR model yielded the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.08827 mm and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.02105 mm. Besides, the prediction accuracy of SVC can attain 96.49% (55 / 57). The results show that the model can accurately predict the time range and displacement of acceleration deformation section of Majiagou landslide. The proposed model is of great significance for landslide prediction and early warning.

It mainly consists of three main aspects: construction of health indicators, remaining useful life prediction, and health management. Construction of health indicators aims to evaluate the system's current health condition and its critical components. Given the observations of a health indicator, prediction of the remaining useful life is used to infer the time when an engineering systems or a critical component will no longer perform its intended function. Health management involves planning the optimal maintenance schedule according to the system's current and future health condition, its critical components and the replacement costs. Construction of health indicators is the key to predicting the remaining useful life. Bearings and gears are the most common mechanical components in rotating machines, and their health conditions are of great concern in practice. Because it is difficult to measure and quantify the health conditions of bearings and gears in many cases, numerous vibration-based methods have been proposed to construct bearing and gear health indicators. This paper presents a thorough review of vibration-based bearing and gear health indicators constructed from mechanical signal processing, modeling, and machine learning. This review paper will be helpful for designing further advanced bearing and gear health indicators and provides a basis for predicting the remaining useful life of bearings and gears. Most of the bearing and gear health indicators reviewed in this paper are highly relevant to simulated and experimental run-to-failure data rather than artificially seeded bearing and gear fault data.

Age- and Sex-Dependent Patterns of Gut Microbial Diversity in Human Adults	MSYSTEMS			English	Article						16S rRNA amplicon; age; diversity; microbiome; sex	CONSORTIA	Gut microbial diversity changes throughout the human life span and is known to be associated with host sex. We investigated the association of age, sex, and gut bacterial alpha diversity in three large cohorts of adults from four geographical regions: subjects from the United States and United Kingdom in the American Gut Project (AGP) citizen-science initiative and two independent cohorts of Colombians and Chinese. In three of the four cohorts, we observed a strong positive association between age and alpha diversity in young adults that plateaued after age 40 years. We also found sex-dependent differences that were more pronounced in younger adults than in middle-aged adults, with women having higher alpha diversity than men. In contrast to the other three cohorts, no association of alpha diversity with age or sex was observed in the Chinese cohort. The association of alpha diversity with age and sex remained after adjusting for cardiometabolic parameters in the Colombian cohort and antibiotic usage in the AGP cohort. We further attempted to predict the microbiota age in individuals using a machine-learning approach for the men and women in each cohort. Consistent with our alpha-diversity-based findings, U.S. and U.K. women had a significantly higher predicted microbiota age than men, with a reduced difference being seen above age 40 years. This difference was not observed in the Colombian cohort and was observed only in middle-aged Chinese adults. Together, our results provide new insights into the influence of age and sex on the biodiversity of the human gut microbiota during adulthood while highlighting similarities and differences across diverse cohorts. IMPORTANCE Microorganisms in the human gut play a role in health and disease, and in adults higher gut biodiversity has been linked to better health. Since gut microorganisms may be pivotal in the development of microbial therapies, understanding the factors that shape gut biodiversity is of utmost interest. We performed large-scale analyses of the relationship of age and sex to gut bacterial diversity in adult cohorts from four geographic regions: the United States, the United Kingdom, Colombia, and China. In the U.S., U.K, and Colombian cohorts, bacterial biodiversity correlated positively with age in young adults but plateaued at about age 40 years, with no positive association being found in middle-aged adults. Young, but not middle-aged, adult women had higher gut bacterial diversity than men, a pattern confirmed via supervised machine learning. Interestingly, in the Chinese cohort, minimal associations were observed between gut biodiversity and age or sex. Our results highlight the patterns of adult gut biodiversity and provide a framework for future research.

Alzheimer's Disease Microbiome Is Associated with Dysregulation of the Anti-Inflammatory P-Glycoprotein Pathway	MBIO			English	Article						Alzheimer's Disease; dementia; elderly; gut-brain axis; intestinal homeostasis; intestinal microbiome	GUT MICROBIOME; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; FRAILTY; INFLAMMATION; MALNUTRITION; RESIDENTS; TAXA	The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system that is poorly understood. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, has long been associated with bacterial infections and inflammation-causing immunosenescence. Recent studies examining the intestinal microbiota of AD patients revealed that their microbiome differs from that of subjects without dementia. In this work, we prospectively enrolled 108 nursing home elders and followed each for up to 5 months, collecting longitudinal stool samples from which we performed metagenomic sequencing and in vitro T84 intestinal epithelial cell functional assays for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, a critical mediator of intestinal homeostasis. Our analysis identified clinical parameters as well as numerous microbial taxa and functional genes that act as predictors of AD dementia in comparison to elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We further demonstrate that stool samples from elders with AD can induce lower P-gp expression levels in vitro those samples from elders without dementia or with other dementia types. We also paired functional studies with machine learning approaches to identify bacterial species differentiating the microbiome of AD elders from that of elders without dementia, which in turn are accurate predictors of the loss of dysregulation of the P-gp pathway. We observed that the microbiome of AD elders shows a lower proportion and prevalence of bacteria with the potential to synthesize butyrate, as well as higher abundances of taxa that are known to cause proinflammatory states. Therefore, a potential nexus between the intestinal microbiome and AD is the modulation of intestinal homeostasis by increases in inflammatory, and decreases in anti-inflammatory, microbial metabolism. IMPORTANCE Studies of the intestinal microbiome and AD have demonstrated associations with microbiome composition at the genus level among matched cohorts. We move this body of literature forward by more deeply investigating microbiome composition via metagenomics and by comparing AD patients against those without dementia and with other dementia types. We also exploit machine learning approaches that combine both metagenomic and clinical data. Finally, our functional studies using stool samples from elders demonstrate how the c microbiome of AD elders can affect intestinal health via dysregulation of the P-glycoprotein pathway. P-glycoprotein dysregulation contributes directly to inflammatory disorders of the intestine. Since AD has been long thought to be linked to chronic bacterial infections as a possible etiology, our findings therefore fill a gap in knowledge in the field of AD research by identifying a nexus between the microbiome, loss of intestinal homeostasis, and inflammation that may underlie this neurodegenerative disorder.

Nevertheless, existing IVN designs (e.g., controller area network) lack cybersecurity consideration. Intrusion detection, an effective method for defending against cyberattacks on IVNs while providing functional safety and real-time communication guarantees, aims to address this issue. Therefore, the necessity of its research has risen. In this paper, an IVN environment is introduced, and the constraints and characteristics of an intrusion detection system (IDS) design for IVNs are presented. A survey of the proposed IDS designs for the IVNs is conducted, and the corresponding drawbacks are highlighted. Various optimization objectives are considered and comprehensively compared. Lastly, the trend, open issues, and emerging research directions are described.

It is the latest technology in the area of medical imaging for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases such as ulcer, polyp, bleeding, etc. Manual diagnosis process is time-consuming and hard for doctors; therefore, researchers have proposed computerized techniques for detection and classification of these diseases. In this article, a deep learning-based method is presented for ulcer detection and gastrointestinal diseases (ulcer, polyp, bleeding) classification. Modified mask Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based ulcer segmentation is proposed. The ulcer annotated images are utilized to train the Mask RCNN model to obtain output in the form of bounding box ulcer detected area and mask segmented region. In the classification phase, the ResNet101 pre-trained CNN model is fine-tuned through transfer learning to derive deep features. The acquired deep features are optimized through grasshopper optimization along with minimum distance fitness function. The best-selected features are finally supplied to a Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) of cubic kernel function for final classification. Experiments have been performed in two-steps; first, the ulcer segmentation results are computed through recall, precision, and Mean Overlap Coefficient (MOC). The ResNet50+FPN as backbone and training all the layers of Mask-RCNN gives best results in terms of MOC = 0.8807 and average precision = 1.0. Second, the best classification accuracy of 99.13% is achieved on the cubic SVM for K = 10. It is clearly perceived that the proposed method outperforms when compared and analyzed with the existing methods. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, YQ; Gong, CY; Yang, L; Chen, YY				Liu, Yeqi; Gong, Chuanyang; Yang, Ling; Chen, Yingyi			DSTP-RNN: A dual-stage two-phase attention-based recurrent neural network for long-term and multivariate time series prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Time series prediction; Spatio-temporal relationship; Attention mechanism; Dual-stage two-phase model; Deep attention network	MODELS	Long-term prediction of multivariate time series is still an important but challenging problem. The key to solve this problem is capturing (1) the spatial correlations at the same time, (2) the spatio-temporal relationships at different times, and (3) long-term dependency of the temporal relationships between different series. Attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNN) can effectively represent and learn the dynamic spatio-temporal relationships between exogenous series and target series, but they only perform well in one-step time prediction and short-term time prediction. In this paper, inspired by human attention mechanism including the dual-stage two-phase (DSTP) model and the influence mechanism of target information and non-target information, we propose DSTP-based RNN (DSTP-RNN) and DSTP-RNN-II respectively for long-term time series prediction. Specifically, we first propose the DSTP-based structure to enhance the spatial correlations between exogenous series. The first phase produces violent but decentralized response weight, while the second phase leads to stationary and concentrated response weight. Then, we employ multiple attentions on target series to boost the long-term dependency. Finally, we study the performance of deep spatial attention mechanism and provide interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that the present work can be successfully used to develop expert or intelligent systems for a wide range of applications, with state-of-the-art performances superior to nine baseline methods on four datasets in the fields of energy, finance, environment and medicine, respectively.

This is rarely valid in practical applications, where we typically encounter training and test sets with different characteristics. In this article, we deal with such situations, namely subjective-exclusive cross-database age estimation. We formulate the age estimation problem as the distribution learning framework, where the age labels are encoded as a probability distribution. To improve the cross-database age estimation performance, we propose a new loss function which provides a more robust measure of the difference between ground-truth and predicted distributions. The desirable properties of the proposed loss function are theoretically analysed and compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we compile a new balanced large-scale age estimation database. Last, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol, called subject-exclusive cross-database age estimation protocol, which provides meaningful information of a method in terms of the generalisation capability. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art age estimation methods under both intra-database and subject-exclusive cross-database evaluation protocols. In addition, in this article, we provide a comparative sensitivity analysis of various algorithms to identify trends and issues inherent to their performance. This analysis introduces some open problems to the community which might be considered when designing a robust age estimation system.

These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.

Hunger games search: Visions, conception, implementation, deep analysis, perspectives, and towards performance shifts	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Hunger Games Search; Optimization; Swarm-intelligence; Metaheuristic; Engineering design problems	WHALE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; SINE COSINE ALGORITHM; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; LEARNING-MACHINE; DIAGNOSIS; EFFICIENT; SYSTEM; RECOGNITION	A recent set of overused population-based methods have been published in recent years. Despite their popularity, most of them have uncertain, immature performance, partially done verifications, similar overused metaphors, similar immature exploration and exploitation components and operations, and an insecure tradeoff between exploration and exploitation trends in most of the new real-world cases. Therefore, all users need to extensively modify and adjust their operations based on main evolutionary methods to reach faster convergence, more stable balance, and high-quality results. To move the optimization community one step ahead toward more focus on performance rather than change of metaphor, a general-purpose population-based optimization technique called Hunger Games Search (HGS) is proposed in this research with a simple structure, special stability features and very competitive performance to realize the solutions of both constrained and unconstrained problems more effectively. The proposed HGS is designed according to the hunger-driven activities and behavioural choice of animals. This dynamic, fitness-wise search method follows a simple concept of "Hunger" as the most crucial homeostatic motivation and reason for behaviours, decisions, and actions in the life of all animals to make the process of optimization more understandable and consistent for new users and decision-makers. The Hunger Games Search incorporates the concept of hunger into the feature process; in other words, an adaptive weight based on the concept of hunger is designed and employed to simulate the effect of hunger on each search step. It follows the computationally logical rules (games) utilized by almost all animals and these rival activities and games are often adaptive evolutionary by securing higher chances of survival and food acquisition. This method's main feature is its dynamic nature, simple structure, and high performance in terms of convergence and acceptable quality of solutions, proving to be more efficient than the current optimization methods. The effectiveness of HGS was verified by comparing HGS with a comprehensive set of popular and advanced algorithms on 23 well-known optimization functions and the IEEE CEC 2014 benchmark test suite. Also, the HGS was applied to several engineering problems to demonstrate its applicability. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizer compared to popular essential optimizers, several advanced variants of the existing methods, and several CEC winners and powerful differential evolution (DE)-based methods abbreviated as LSHADE, SPS_L_SHADE_EIG, LSHADE_cnEpSi, SHADE, SADE, MPEDE, and JDE methods in handling many single-objective problems. We designed this open-source population-based method to be a standard tool for optimization in different areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning with several new exploratory and exploitative features, high performance, and high optimization capacity. The method is very flexible and scalable to be extended to fit more form of optimization cases in both structural aspects and application sides.

Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.

Similarly, some environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) have been shown to be associated with transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but global data on their association with COVID-19 are scarce. Objective: To examine the association between climatic factors and COVID-19. Methods: We used multilevel mixed-effects (two-level random-intercepts) negative binomial regression models to examine the association between 7- and 14-day-lagged temperature, humidity (relative and absolute), wind speed and UV index and COVID-19 cases, adjusting for Gross Domestic Products, Global Health Security Index, cloud cover (%), precipitation (mm), sea-level air-pressure (mb), and daytime length. The effects estimates are reported as adjusted rate ratio (aRR) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Data from 206 countries/regions (until April 20, 2020) with >= 100 reported cases showed no association between COVID-19 cases and 7-day-lagged temperature, relative humidity, UV index, and wind speed, after adjusting for potential confounders, but a positive association with 14-day-lagged temperature and a negative association with 14-day-lagged wind speed. Compared to an absolute humidity of <5 g/m(3), an absolute humidity of 5-10 g/m(3) was associated with a 23% (95% CI: 6-42%) higher rate of COVID-19 cases, while absolute humidity >10 g/m(3) did not have a significant effect. These findings were robust in the 14-day-lagged analysis. Conclusion: Our results of higher COVID-19 cases (through April 20) at absolute humidity of 5-10 g/m(3) may be suggestive of a 'sweet point' for viral transmission, however only controlled laboratory experiments can decisively prove it.

Nevertheless, it is still difficult to achieve the cross-mode information fusion of spatial mode and spectral mode when reconstructing HR-HSI for the existing methods. In this article, based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), an interpretable spatialx2013;spectral reconstruction network (SSR-NET) is proposed for more efficient HSI and MSI fusion. More specifically, the proposed SSR-NET is a physical straightforward model that consists of three components: 1) cross-mode message inserting (CMMI); this operation can produce the preliminary fused HR-HSI, preserving the most valuable information of LR-HSI and HR-MSI; 2) spatial reconstruction network (SpatRN); the SpatRN concentrates on reconstructing the lost spatial information of LR-HSI with the guidance of spatial edge loss and 3) spectral reconstruction network (SpecRN); the SpecRN pays attention to reconstruct the lost spectral information of HR-MSI under the constraint of spatial edge loss.

New types of computer chips that are suited to the task of deep learning, such as memristor arrays where data handling and computing take place within the same unit, are required. A well-used deep learning model called long short-term memory, which can handle temporal sequential data analysis, is now implemented in a memristor crossbar array, promising an energy-efficient and low-footprint deep learning platform. Recent breakthroughs in recurrent deep neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units have led to major advances in artificial intelligence. However, state-of-the-art LSTM models with significantly increased complexity and a large number of parameters have a bottleneck in computing power resulting from both limited memory capacity and limited data communication bandwidth. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the synaptic weights shared in different time steps in an LSTM can be implemented with a memristor crossbar array, which has a small circuit footprint, can store a large number of parameters and offers in-memory computing capability that contributes to circumventing the 'von Neumann bottleneck'. We illustrate the capability of our crossbar system as a core component in solving real-world problems in regression and classification, which shows that memristor LSTM is a promising low-power and low-latency hardware platform for edge inference.

M.; Zelezniak, Aleksej			Expanding functional protein sequence spaces using generative adversarial networks	NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							FITNESS LANDSCAPE; ALIGNMENTS; ACID; EFFICIENT; BIOLOGY; SEARCH; MODELS	De novo protein design for catalysis of any desired chemical reaction is a long-standing goal in protein engineering because of the broad spectrum of technological, scientific and medical applications. However, mapping protein sequence to protein function is currently neither computationally nor experimentally tangible. Here, we develop ProteinGAN, a self-attention-based variant of the generative adversarial network that is able to 'learn' natural protein sequence diversity and enables the generation of functional protein sequences. ProteinGAN learns the evolutionary relationships of protein sequences directly from the complex multidimensional amino-acid sequence space and creates new, highly diverse sequence variants with natural-like physical properties. Using malate dehydrogenase (MDH) as a template enzyme, we show that 24% (13 out of 55 tested) of the ProteinGAN-generated and experimentally tested sequences are soluble and display MDH catalytic activity in the tested conditions in vitro, including a highly mutated variant of 106 amino-acid substitutions. ProteinGAN therefore demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to rapidly generate highly diverse functional proteins within the allowed biological constraints of the sequence space. A protein's three-dimensional structure and properties are defined by its amino-acid sequence, but mapping protein sequence to protein function is a computationally highly intensive task. A new generative adversarial network approach learns from natural protein sequences and generates new, diverse protein sequence variations, which are experimentally tested.

For covariance functions that are Green's functions of elliptic boundary value problems and homogeneously distributed sampling points, we show how to identify a subset S subset of {1, ..., N}(2), with #S = O (N log(N) log(d)(N/epsilon)), such that the zero fill-in incomplete Cholesky factorization of the sparse matrix Theta(ij)1((ij)is an element of S) is an epsilon-approximation of Theta. This factorization can provably be obtained in complexity O(N log(N) log(d)(N/epsilon)) in space and O(N log(2)(N)log(2d)(N/epsilon)) in time, improving upon the state of the art for general elliptic operators; we further present numerical evidence that d can be taken to be the intrinsic dimension of the data set rather than that of the ambient space. The algorithm only needs to know the spatial configuration of the xi and does not require an analytic representation of G. Furthermore, this factorization straightforwardly provides an approximate sparse PCA with optimal rate of convergence in the operator norm. Hence, by using only subsampling and the incomplete Cholesky factorization, we obtain, at nearly linear complexity, the compression, inversion, and approximate PCA of a large class of covariance matrices. By inverting the order of the Cholesky factorization we also obtain a solver for elliptic PDE with complexity O(N log(d)(N/epsilon)) in space and O(N log(2d)(N/epsilon)) in time, improving upon the state of the art for general elliptic operators.

The Convolution network is applied to robustly extract data input features from predictive variables (i.e., statistically significant antecedent inputs) while Long Short-Term Memory absorbs them for prediction. Half-hourly GSR for Alice Springs (Australia: 01 January 2006 to 31 August 2018) are extracted with stationarity checks applied via unit-root and mutual information test to capture antecedent GSR values required to forecast future GSR. The proposed hybrid model is benchmarked with standalone models as well as other Deep Learning, Single Hidden Layer and Tree based models. The results show that the benchmarked models are not able to generate satisfactory GSR predictions and the proposed hybrid model outperforms all other counterparts. The hybrid model registers superior results with over 70% of predictive errors lying below +/- 10 Wm(-2) and outperforms the benchmark model for 1-Day half-hourly GSR prediction with low Relative Root Mean Square Error (approximate to 1.515%), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (approximate to 4.672%) and Absolute Percentage Bias (approximate to 1.233%). This study ascertains that a proposed hybrid model based on a convolution network framework can accurately predict GSR and enable energy availability to be regularly monitored over multi-step horizons when coupled with a low latency Long Short-Term Memory network. Furthermore, it also concludes that the proposed model can have practical implications in forecasting GSR, capitalizing its versatility as a stratagem in monitoring solar powered systems by integrating freely available solar radiation into a real power grid system.

We recruitedn = 1,002 twins and unrelated healthy adults in the United Kingdom to the PREDICT 1 study and assessed postprandial metabolic responses in a clinical setting and at home. We observed large inter-individual variability (as measured by the population coefficient of variation (s.d./mean, %)) in postprandial responses of blood triglyceride (103%), glucose (68%) and insulin (59%) following identical meals. Person-specific factors, such as gut microbiome, had a greater influence (7.1% of variance) than did meal macronutrients (3.6%) for postprandial lipemia, but not for postprandial glycemia (6.0% and 15.4%, respectively); genetic variants had a modest impact on predictions (9.5% for glucose, 0.8% for triglyceride, 0.2% for C-peptide). Findings were independently validated in a US cohort (n = 100 people). We developed a machine-learning model that predicted both triglyceride (r = 0.47) and glycemic (r = 0.77) responses to food intake. These findings may be informative for developing personalized diet strategies. The ClinicalTrials.gov registration identifier is NCT03479866.

CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simplified variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications. CADD scores, software and documentation are available at https://cadd.gs.washington.edu.

Protein function prediction is a classic research topic in this subject area. Though many scholars have made achievements in identifying protein by different algorithms, they often extract a large number of feature types and use very complex classification methods to obtain little improvement in the classification effect, and this process is very time-consuming. In this research, we attempt to utilize as few features as possible to classify vesicular transportation proteins and to simultaneously obtain a comparative satisfactory classification result. We adopt CTDC which is a submethod of the method of composition, transition, and distribution (CTD) to extract only 39 features from each sequence, and LibSVM is used as the classification method. We use the SMOTE method to deal with the problem of dataset imbalance. There are 11619 protein sequences in our dataset. We selected 4428 sequences to train our classification model and selected other 1832 sequences from our dataset to test the classification effect and finally achieved an accuracy of 71.77%. After dimension reduction by MRMD, the accuracy is 72.16%.

Bringing recent technological innovations in automation, robotics and computer science together with current approaches in chemistry, materials synthesis and characterization will act as a catalyst for revolutionizing traditional research and development in both industry and academia. This Perspective provides a vision for an integrated artificial intelligence approach towards autonomous materials discovery, which, in our opinion, will emerge within the next 5 to 10 years. The approach we discuss requires the integration of the following tools, which have already seen substantial development to date: high-throughput virtual screening, automated synthesis planning, automated laboratories and machine learning algorithms. In addition to reducing the time to deployment of new materials by an order of magnitude, this integrated approach is expected to lower the cost associated with the initial discovery. Thus, the price of the final products (for example, solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles) will also decrease. This in turn will enable industries and governments to meet more ambitious targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a faster pace.

Hence, COVID-19 vaccines that can elicit a robust T cell response may be particularly important. The design, development and experimental evaluation of such vaccines is aided by an understanding of the landscape of T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2, which is largely unknown. Due to the challenges of identifying epitopes experimentally, many studies have proposed the use of in silico methods. Here, we present a review of the in silico methods that have been used for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. These methods employ a diverse set of technical approaches, often rooted in machine learning. A performance comparison is provided based on the ability to identify a specific set of immunogenic epitopes that have been determined experimentally to be targeted by T cells in convalescent COVID-19 patients, shedding light on the relative performance merits of the different approaches adopted by the in silico studies. The review also puts forward perspectives for future re-search directions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They are of great interest for machine learning tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, playing board games and medical diagnosis(1-7). Optical neural networks offer the promise of dramatically accelerating computing speed using the broad optical bandwidths available. Here we demonstrate a universal optical vector convolutional accelerator operating at more than ten TOPS (trillions (10(12)) of operations per second, or tera-ops per second), generating convolutions of images with 250,000 pixels-sufficiently large for facial image recognition. We use the same hardware to sequentially form an optical convolutional neural network with ten output neurons, achieving successful recognition of handwritten digit images at 88 per cent accuracy. Our results are based on simultaneously interleaving temporal, wavelength and spatial dimensions enabled by an integrated microcomb source. This approach is scalable and trainable to much more complex networks for demanding applications such as autonomous vehicles and real-time video recognition.

We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of similar to 1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity's role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.

J	Zhong, H; Wang, JJ; Jia, HJ; Mu, YF; Lv, SL				Zhong, Hai; Wang, Jiajun; Jia, Hongjie; Mu, Yunfei; Lv, Shilei			Vector field-based support vector regression for building energy consumption prediction	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Vector field; Support vector regression; Building energy consumption prediction; Data-driven	ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; SIMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; GUIDANCE; CAPABILITIES; SECTOR; MATRIX; IMPACT; MODEL; SVM	Building energy consumption prediction plays an irreplaceable role in energy planning, management, and conservation. Data-driven approaches, such as artificial neural networks, support vector regression, gradient boosting regression and extreme learning machine are the most advanced methods for building energy prediction. However, owing to the high nonlinearity between inputs and outputs of building energy consumption prediction models, the aforementioned approaches require improvement with regard to the prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability. To counter these shortcomings, a novel vector field-based support vector regression method is proposed in this paper. Through multi-distortions in the sample data space or high-dimensional feature space mapped by a vector field, the optimal feature space is found, in which the high non linearity between inputs and outputs is approximated by linearity. Hence, the proposed method ensures a high accuracy, a generalization ability, and robustness for building energy consumption prediction. A large office building in a coastal town of China is used for a case study, and its summer hourly cooling load data are used as energy consumption data. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance than commonly used methods with regard to the accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability.

Of numerous approaches to alleviating its conditional independence assumption, feature weighting has placed more emphasis on highly predictive features than those that are less predictive. In this paper, we argue that for NB highly predictive features should be highly correlated with the class (maximum mutual relevance), yet uncorrelated with other features (minimum mutual redundancy). Based on this premise, we propose a correlation-based feature weighting (CFW) filter for NB. In CFW, the weight for a feature is a sigmoid transformation of the difference between the feature-class correlation (mutual relevance) and the average feature-feature intercorrelation (average mutual redundancy). Experimental results show that NB with CFW significantly outperforms NB and all the other existing state-of-the-art feature weighting filters used to compare. Compared to feature weighting wrappers for improving NB, the main advantages of CFW are its low computational complexity (no search involved) and the fact that it maintains the simplicity of the final model. Besides, we apply CFW to text classification and have achieved remarkable improvements.

Metallic defect detection is usually performed against complex industrial scenarios, presenting an interesting but challenging problem. Traditional methods are based on image processing or shallow machine learning techniques, but these can only detect defects under specific detection conditions, such as obvious defect contours with strong contrast and low noise, at certain scales, or under specific illumination conditions. This paper discusses the automatic detection of metallic defects with a twofold procedure that accurately localizes and classifies defects appearing in input images captured from real industrial environments. A novel cascaded autoencoder (CASAE) architecture is designed for segmenting and localizing defects. The cascading network transforms the input defect image into a pixel-wise prediction mask based on semantic segmentation. The defect regions of segmented results are classified into their specific classes via a compact convolutional neural network (CNN). Metallic defects under various conditions can be successfully detected using an industrial dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that this method meets the robustness and accuracy requirements for metallic defect detection. Meanwhile, it can also be extended to other detection applications.

Realising this potential raises challenges at policy and electricity system planning level. To address this, the authors have developed a geospatially explicit methodology using up-to-date spatial information of the EU building stock to quantify the available rooftop area for PV systems. To do this, it combines satellite-based and statistical data sources with machine learning to provide a reliable assessment of the technical potential for rooftop PV electricity production with a spatial resolution of 100m across the European Union (EU). It estimates the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) using country-specific parameters and compares it to the latest household electricity prices. The results show that the EU rooftops could potentially produce 680 TWh of solar electricity annually (representing 24.4% of current electricity consumption), two thirds of which at a cost lower than the current residential tariffs. Country aggregated results illustrate existing barriers for cost-effective rooftop systems in countries with low electricity prices and high investment interest rates, as well as provide indications on how to address these.

People worldwide are susceptible to this deadly disease. To control the prevailing havoc of coronavirus, researchers are adopting techniques like plasma therapy, proning, medicines, etc. To stop the rapid spread of COVID-19, contact tracing is one of the important ways to check the infected people. This paper explains the various challenges people and health practitioners are facing due to COVID-19. In this paper, various ways with which the impact of COVID-19 can be controlled using IoT technology have been discussed. A six-layer architecture of IoT solutions for containing the deadly COVID-19 has been proposed. In addition to this, the role of machine learning techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 has been discussed in this paper, and a quick explanation of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) applications for contact tracing has also been specified. From the study conducted, it is evident that IoT solutions can be used in various ways for restricting the impact of COVID-19. Furthermore, IoT can be used in the healthcare sector to assure people's safety and good health with minimal costs.

The GLAD ARD represent a 16-day time-series of tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to present, updated annually, and designed for land cover monitoring at global to local scales. A set of tools for multi-temporal data processing and characterization using machine learning provided with GLAD ARD serves as an end-to-end solution for Landsat-based natural resource assessment and monitoring. The GLAD ARD data and tools have been implemented at the national, regional, and global extent for water, forest, and crop mapping.

It aims to use genome-wide markers to estimate the effects of all loci and thereby predict the genetic values of untested populations, so as to achieve more comprehensive and reliable selection and to accelerate genetic progress in crop breeding. GS models usually face the problem that the number of markers is much higher than the number of phenotypic observations. To overcome this issue and improve prediction accuracy, many models and algorithms, including GBLUP, Bayes, and machine learning have been employed for GS. As hot issues in GS research, the estimation of non-additive genetic effects and the combined analysis of multiple traits or multiple environments are also important for improving the accuracy of prediction. In recent years, crop breeding has taken advantage of the development of GS. The principles and characteristics of current popular GS methods and research progress in these methods for crop improvement are reviewed in this paper.

Here, we present ProTox-II that incorporates molecular similarity, pharmacophores, fragment propensities and machine-learning models for the prediction of various toxicity endpoints; such as acute toxicity, hepatotoxicity, cytotoxicity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, immunotoxicity, adverse outcomes pathways (Tox21) and toxicity targets. The predictive models are built on data from both in vitro assays (e.g. Tox21 assays, Ames bacterialmutation assays, hepG2 cytotoxicity assays, Immunotoxicity assays) and in vivo cases (e.g. carcinogenicity, hepatotoxicity). The models have been validated on independent external sets and have shown strong performance. ProTox-II provides a freely available webserver for in silico toxicity prediction for toxicologists, regulatory agencies, computational and medicinal chemists, and all users without login at http://tox.charite.de/protox II. The webserver takes a two-dimensional chemical structure as an input and reports the possible toxicity profile of the chemical for 33 models with confidence scores, and an overall toxicity radar chart along with three most similar compounds with known acute toxicity.

J	Al-Turjman, F				Al-Turjman, Fadi			A novel approach for drones positioning in mission critical applications	TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; NAVIGATION	Recently, the flying sensor systems have been given a careful interest to provide critical administrations and services in a fiasco territory. Since severe debacles require the trading of geo-referenced area-based data among the salvage group and additionally the people in question, an independent exact situating framework is required. A Worldwide situating framework, or a global positioning system (GPS), gives close precise area data when there is an immediate viewable pathway with something like four satellites. Nonetheless, GPS beneficiaries may experience blackouts inside regions where satellite signs are hindered by impediments, for example, the normal mists in the sky and jammed structures in urban areas. This would prompt significant corruption in crisply developing remote detecting/flying applications, for example, those utilizing Drones. Therefore, to conquer this issue, GPS is coordinated with inertial navigation system (INS) to get a dependable route arrangement, particularly amid GPS blackouts. This study presents test and reproduction aftereffects of incorporation strategy dependent on machine learning that coordinates GPS with INS progressively. A field information was utilized to execute the combination and acquire promising outcomes. In addition, a discourse about benefits and impediments of the proposed strategy is given.

J	Hu, X; Han, YM; Yu, B; Geng, ZQ; Fan, JZ				Hu, Xuan; Han, Yongming; Yu, Bin; Geng, Zhiqiang; Fan, Jinzhen			Novel leakage detection and water loss management of urban water supply network using multiscale neural networks	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Leakage detection; Water loss management; DBSCAN; Fully convolutional neural network; MFCN; Water distribution system	DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; PIPE BREAKS; MODEL; LOCATION	Due to the acceleration of urbanization, water supply pipe networks often lack the planning. Using the series number of the pipes as category label will result in too many classification categories, and requires many training data to achieve detected accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes novel leakage detection model based on density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and multiscale fully convolutional networks (MFCN) (DBSCAN-MFCN) to manage the water loss. In order to reduce the number of categories, a large water network is divided into a number of zones by the DBSCAN. The zones are used as the learning labels, which reduces the size of the output matrix of the MFCN. Then the leakage detection model is built based on the proposed method to detect the leakage area. Compared with support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the accuracy of the proposed method is improved by 78%, 72% and 28%, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed method can solve the problem of leakage area detection, improve leakage detection efficiency and reduce water loss. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the last 30 years, several approaches to deal with this issue have been proposed. However, the reproducibility of these methods is often limited, making the comparison with the state of the art hard to achieve. Thus, to fill this gap, we propose a new benchmark consisting of recent advances in MS pansharpening. In particular, optimized classical approaches [multiresolution analysis (MRA) and component substitution (CS)] are compared with methods belonging to the third generation of pansharpening, represented by variational optimization-based (VO) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The benchmark is tested on different scenarios (from urban to rural areas) acquired by different commercial sensors [i.e., IKONOS (IK), GeoEye-1 (GE-1), and WorldView-3 (WV-3)]. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments and the computational burden are analyzed in this article, and all of the implementations have been collected in a MATLAB toolbox that is made available to the community.

It takes as inputs soil observations from about 240 000 locations worldwide and over 400 global environmental covariates describing vegetation, terrain morphology, climate, geology and hydrology. The aim of this work was the production of global maps of soil properties, with cross-validation, hyper-parameter selection and quantification of spatially explicit uncertainty, as implemented in the SoilGrids version 2.0 product incorporating state-of-the-art practices and adapting them for global digital soil mapping with legacy data. The paper presents the evaluation of the global predictions produced for soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen, coarse fragments, pH (water), cation exchange capacity, bulk density and texture fractions at six standard depths (up to 200 cm). The quantitative evaluation showed metrics in line with previous global, continental and large-region studies. The qualitative evaluation showed that coarse-scale patterns are well reproduced. The spatial uncertainty at global scale highlighted the need for more soil observations, especially in high-latitude regions.	[Poggio, Laura; de Sousa, Luis M.; Batjes, Niels H.; Heuvelink, Gerard B.

In the past decade, enormous efforts have been made to process and analyze these HS products, mainly by seasoned experts. However, with an ever-growing volume of data, the bulk of costs in manpower and material resources poses new challenges for reducing the burden of manual labor and improving efficiency. For this reason, it is urgent that more intelligent and automatic approaches for various HS RS applications be developed. Machine learning (ML) tools with convex optimization have successfully undertaken the tasks of numerous artificial intelligence (AI)-related applications; however, their ability to handle complex practical problems remains limited, particularly for HS data, due to the effects of various spectral variabilities in the process of HS imaging and the complexity and redundancy of higher-dimensional HS signals. Compared to convex models, nonconvex modeling, which is capable of characterizing more complex real scenes and providing model interpretability technically and theoretically, has proven to be a feasible solution that reduces the gap between challenging HS vision tasks and currently advanced intelligent data processing models.

Due to the huge number of newly available peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, the development of automated computational models for the identification of novel bitter peptides is highly desirable. Results: In this work, we present BERT4Bitter, a bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT)based model for predicting bitter peptides directly from their amino acid sequence without using any structural information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a BERT-based model has been employed to identify bitter peptides. Compared to widely used machine learning models, BERT4Bitter achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 0.861 and 0.922 for cross-validation and independent tests, respectively. Furthermore, extensive empirical benchmarking experiments on the independent dataset demonstrated that BERT4Bitter clearly outperformed the existing method with improvements of 8.0% accuracy and 16.0% Matthews coefficient correlation, highlighting the effectiveness and robustness of BERT4Bitter. We believe that the BERT4Bitter method proposed herein will be a useful tool for rapidly screening and identifying novel bitter peptides for drug development and nutritional research.

These rapid responses leverage billions of mobile phones, large online datasets, connected devices, relatively low-cost computing resources and advances in machine learning and natural language processing. This Review aims to capture the breadth of digital innovations for the public-health response to COVID-19 worldwide and their limitations, and barriers to their implementation, including legal, ethical and privacy barriers, as well as organizational and workforce barriers. The future of public health is likely to become increasingly digital, and we review the need for the alignment of international strategies for the regulation, evaluation and use of digital technologies to strengthen pandemic management, and future preparedness for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an accelerated development of applications for digital health, including symptom monitoring and contact tracing. Their potential is wide ranging and must be integrated into conventional approaches to public health for best effect.

Most of the existing approaches seek for adapting the model from one domain to another. However, such single-source and single-target setting prevents the methods from being scalable solutions since, nowadays, multiple sources and target domains having different data distributions are usually available. Besides, the continuous proliferation of satellite images necessitates the classifiers to adapt to continuously increasing data. We propose a novel approach, coined DAugNet, for unsupervised, multisource, multitarget, and life-long domain adaptation of satellite images. It consists of a classifier and a data augmentor. The data augmentor, which is a shallow network, is able to perform style transfer between multiple satellite images in an unsupervised manner, even when new data are added over time. In each training iteration, it provides the classifier with diversified data, which makes the classifier robust to large data distribution difference between the domains. Our extensive experiments prove that DAugNet significantly better generalizes to new geographic locations than the existing approaches.

This article derives machine learning-enabled calendar aging prediction for lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) technique is employed to capture the underlying mapping among capacity, storage temperature, and state-of-charge. By modifying the isotropic kernel function with an automatic relevance determination (ARD) structure, high relevant input features can be effectively extracted to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Experimental battery calendar aging data from nine storage cases are utilized for model training, validation, and comparison, which is more meaningful and practical than using the data from a single condition. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed GPR model with ARD Matern32 (M32) kernel outperforms other counterparts and can achieve reliable prediction results for all storage cases. Even for the partial-data training test, multistep prediction test, and accelerated aging training test, the proposed ARD-based GPR model is still capable of excavating the useful features, therefore offering good generalization ability and accurate prediction results for calendar aging under various storage conditions. This is the first-known data-driven application that utilizes the GPR with ARD kernel to perform battery calendar aging prognosis.

These platforms play a key role in facilitating greater outreach and influence. This study proposes a mechanism for measuring the influencer index across popular social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. A set of features that determine the impact on the consumers are modelled using a regression approach. The underlying machine learning algorithms including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), K-NN Regression (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Lasso Regression models are adapted to compute a cumulative score in terms of influencer index. Findings indicate that engagement, outreach, sentiment, and growth play a key role in determining the influencers. Further, the ensemble of the four models resulted in the highest accuracy of 93.7% followed by the KNN regression with 93.6%. The study has implications across various domains of e-commerce, viral marketing, social media marketing and brand management wherein identification of key information propagators is essential. These influencer indices may further be utilized by e-commerce portals and brands for the purpose of social media promotion and engagement for larger outreach.

The confidence in MS/MS-based annotation of chemical structures is impacted by instrumental settings and requirements, data acquisition modes including data-dependent and data-independent methods, library scoring algorithms, as well as post-curation steps. We critically discuss parameters that influence search results, such as mass accuracy, precursor ion isolation width, intensity thresholds, centroiding algorithms, and acquisition speed. A range of publicly and commercially available MS/MS databases such as NIST, MassBank, MoNA, LipidBlast, Wiley MSforID, and METLIN are surveyed. In addition, software tools including NIST MS Search, MS-DIAL, Mass Frontier, SmileMS, Mass++, and XCMS2 to perform fast MS/MS search are discussed. MS/MS scoring algorithms and challenges during compound annotation are reviewed. Advanced methods such as the in silico generation of tandem mass spectra using quantum chemistry and machine learning methods are covered. Community efforts for curation and sharing of tandem mass spectra that will allow for faster distribution of scientific discoveries are discussed.

As the key component in ASSLBs, solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with non-flammability and good adaptability to lithium metal anodes have attracted extensive attention in recent years. Among the current SSEs, composite solid-state electrolytes (CSSEs) with multiple phases have greater flexibility to customize and combine the advantages of single-phase electrolytes, which have been widely investigated recently and regarded as promising candidates for commercial ASSLBs. Based on existing investigations, herein, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in CSSEs. Initially, we introduce the historical development from solid-state ionic conductors to CSSEs, and then summarize the fundamentals including mechanisms of lithium ion transport, key evaluation parameters, design principles, and key materials. Four main types of advanced structures for CSSEs are classified and highlighted according to the recent progress. Moreover, advanced characterization and computational simulation techniques including machine learning are reviewed for the first time, and the main challenges and perspectives of CSSEs are also provided for their future development.

J	O'Madagain, C; Tomasello, M				O'Madagain, Cathal; Tomasello, Michael			Shared intentionality, reason-giving and the evolution of human culture	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						common knowledge; shared intentionality; cooperation; cumulative culture	HUMAN CUMULATIVE CULTURE; PEDAGOGICAL CUES; CHILDREN; CHIMPANZEES; CONFORMITY; EMERGENCE; BEHAVIOR	The biological approach to culture focuses almost exclusively on processes of social learning, to the neglect of processes of cultural coordination including joint action and shared intentionality. In this paper, we argue that the distinctive features of human culture derive from humans' unique skills and motivations for coordinating with one another around different types of action and information. As different levels of these skills of 'shared intentionality' emerged over the last several hundred thousand years, human culture became characterized first by such things as collaborative activities and pedagogy based on cooperative communication, and then by such things as collaborative innovations and normatively structured pedagogy. As a kind of capstone of this trajectory, humans began to coordinate not just on joint actions and shared beliefs, but on the reasons for what we believe or how we act. Coordinating on reasons powered the kinds of extremely rapid innovation and stable cumulative cultural evolution especially characteristic of the human species in the last several tens of thousands of years. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.

After decades of effort, 17% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure(1). Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold(2), at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.

The process of Competitive Intelligence (CI) includes monitoring competitors with a view to delivering both actionable and meaningful intelligence to organizations. In this regard, the capacity to leverage and unleash the potential of big data tools and techniques is one of various significant components of successfully steering CI and ultimately infusing such valuable knowledge into CI strategies. In this paper, the authors aim to examine Big Data applications in CI processes within organizations by exploring how organizations deal with Big Data analytics, and this study provides a context for developing Big Data frameworks and process models for CI in organizations. Overall, research findings have indicated a preference for a rather centralized informal process as opposed to a clear formal structure for CI; the use of basic tools for queries, as opposed to reliance on dedicated methods such as advanced machine learning; and the existence of multiple challenges that companies currently face regarding the use of big data analytics in building organizational CI.

The proposed algorithm is known as an artificial intelligence or simply Al-enabled multihop and administrative-distance-based opportunistic routing (MHADBOR) algorithm, which processes the collected information from source to the destination by means of multihop count and administrative-distance-based communication infrastructure in the network. Beside that, we used cluster heads (CH), microbase stations (RBS), and macrobase stations (NBS) in the network with a frequent rate to effectively utilize the administrative distance while managing the deployed network traffic in a congestionless communication environment. In addition, the MHADBOR algorithm empowers the participating devices to practice the administrative distance rather than hop count communication when they are in the vicinity of network special components, e.g., CH and RBS outcome statistics of the MHADBOR algorithm in the simulation environment exhibit an extraordinary improvement in contention, congestion, communication, and computing costs, accompanied by throughput and end-to-end (E2E) delay and packet loss ratio in the deployed AG-IoT network.

To address this challenge, realistic protection and investigation countermeasures, such as network intrusion detection and network forensic systems, need to be effectively developed. For this purpose, a well-structured and representative dataset is paramount for training and validating the credibility of the systems. Although there are several network datasets, in most cases, not much information is given about the Botnet scenarios that were used. This paper proposes a new dataset, so-called Bot-IoT, which incorporates legitimate and simulated IoT network traffic, along with various types of attacks. We also present a realistic testbed environment for addressing the existing dataset drawbacks of capturing complete network information, accurate labeling, as well as recent and complex attack diversity. Finally, we evaluate the reliability of the BoT-IoT dataset using different statistical and machine learning methods for forensics purposes compared with the benchmark datasets. This work provides the baseline for allowing botnet identification across IoT-specific networks. The Bot-IoT dataset can be accessed at Bot-iot (2018) [1]. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SCRM strategies often depend on rapid and adaptive decision-making based on potentially large, multidimensional data sources. These characteristics make SCRM a suitable application area for artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of supply chain literature that addresses problems relevant to SCRM using approaches that fall within the AI spectrum. To that end, an investigation is conducted on the various definitions and classifications of supply chain risk and related notions such as uncertainty. Then, a mapping study is performed to categorise existing literature according to the AI methodology used, ranging from mathematical programming to Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics, and the specific SCRM task they address (identification, assessment or response). Finally, a comprehensive analysis of each category is provided to identify missing aspects and unexplored areas and propose directions for future research at the confluence of SCRM and AI.

Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.

Second, 12 landslide conditioning factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility modeling, including slope aspect, slope angle, plan curvature, profile curvature, elevation, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, lithology, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), land use, and rainfall. Third, the correlations between the conditioning factors and the occurrence of landslides were analyzed using normalized frequency ratios. A multicollinearity analysis of the landslide conditioning factors was carried out using tolerances and variance inflation factor (VIF) methods. Feature selection was performed using the chi-squared statistic with a 10-fold cross-validation technique to assess the predictive capabilities of the landslide conditioning factors. Then, the landslide conditioning factors with null predictive ability were excluded in order to optimize the landslide models. Finally, the trained KLR, NB, and RBFNetwork models were used to construct landslide susceptibility maps. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, the area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical measures, such as accuracy (ACC), F-measure, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), were used for the assessment, validation, and comparison of the resulting models in order to choose the best model in this study. The validation results show that all three models exhibit reasonably good performance, and the KLR model exhibits the most stable and best performance. The KLR model, which has a success rate of 0.847 and a prediction rate of 0.749, is a promising technique for landslide susceptibility mapping. Given the outcomes of the study, all three models could be used efficiently for landslide susceptibility analysis.

Temporal transcriptional logic of dynamic regulatory networks underlying nitrogen signaling and use in plants	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						systems biology; plant biology; nitrogen assimilation; transcriptional dynamics; network inference	NITRATE RESPONSE; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; GENE NETWORK; REVEALS; MUTANT; ASSIMILATION; AMMONIUM; DNA	This study exploits time, the relatively unexplored fourth dimension of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), to learn the temporal transcriptional logic underlying dynamic nitrogen (N) signaling in plants. Our "just-in-time" analysis of time-series transcriptome data uncovered a temporal cascade of cis elements underlying dynamic N signaling. To infer transcription factor (TF)-target edges in a GRN, we applied a time-based machine learning method to 2,174 dynamic N-responsive genes. We experimentally determined a network precision cutoff, using TF-regulated genome-wide targets of three TF hubs (CRF4, SNZ, and CDF1), used to "prune" the network to 155 TFs and 608 targets. This network precision was reconfirmed using genome-wide TF-target regulation data for four additional TFs (TGA1, HHO5/6, and PHL1) not used in network pruning. These higher-confidence edges in the GRN were further filtered by independent TF-target binding data, used to calculate a TF "N-specificity" index. This refined GRN identifies the temporal relationship of known/validated regulators of N signaling (NLP7/8, TGA1/4, NAC4, HRS1, and LBD37/38/39) and 146 additional regulators. Six TFs-CRF4, SNZ, CDF1, HHO5/6, and PHL1-validated herein regulate a significant number of genes in the dynamic N response, targeting 54% of N-uptake/assimilation pathway genes. Phenotypically, inducible overexpression of CRF4 in planta regulates genes resulting in altered biomass, root development, and 15NO3 -uptake, specifically under low-N conditions. This dynamic N-signaling GRN nowprovides the temporal "transcriptional logic" for 155 candidate TFs to improve nitrogen use efficiency with potential agricultural applications. Broadly, these time-based approaches can uncover the temporal transcriptional logic for any biological response system in biology, agriculture, or medicine.

The Role of Chemistry in Fracture Pattern Development and Opportunities to Advance Interpretations of Geological Materials	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS			English	Review						fractured reservoir; crack seal; unconventional resources; CO2 sequestration; shale; quartz	SUBCRITICAL CRACK-GROWTH; TIGHT-GAS SANDSTONE; ERIBOLL FORMATION SANDSTONES; PROGRESSIVELY WIDENING VEIN; OPENING-MODE FRACTURES; FLUID-FLOW PROPERTIES; JABAL-AKHDAR DOME; REACTIVE TRANSPORT; NATURAL FRACTURES; PICEANCE BASIN	Fracture pattern development has been a challenging area of research in the Earth sciences for more than 100 years. Much has been learned about the spatial and temporal complexity inherent to these systems, but severe challenges remain. Future advances will require new approaches. Chemical processes play a larger role in opening-mode fracture pattern development than has hitherto been appreciated. This review examines relationships between mechanical and geochemical processes that influence the fracture patterns recorded in natural settings. For fractures formed in diagenetic settings (similar to 50 to 200 degrees C), we review evidence of chemical reactions in fractures and show how a chemical perspective helps solve problems in fracture analysis. We also outline impediments to subsurface pattern measurement and interpretation, assess implications of discoveries in fracture history reconstruction for process-based models, review models of fracture cementation and chemically assisted fracture growth, and discuss promising paths for future work. To accurately predict the mechanical and fluid flow properties of fracture systems, a processes-based approach is needed. Progress is possible using observational, experimental, and modeling approaches that view fracture patterns and properties as the result of coupled mechanical and chemical processes. A critical area is reconstructing patterns through time. Such data sets are essential for developing and testing predictive models. Other topics that need work include models of crystal growth and dissolution rates under geological conditions, cement mechanical effects, and subcritical crack propagation. Advances in machine learning and 3-D imaging present opportunities for a mechanistic understanding of fracture formation and development, enabling prediction of spatial and temporal complexity over geologic timescales. Geophysical research with a chemical perspective is needed to correctly identify and interpret fractures from geophysical measurements during site characterization and monitoring of subsurface engineering activities.

Since eddy covariance flux towers have a relatively small footprint and are distributed unevenly across the world, upscaling the observations is necessary to obtain global-scale estimates of biosphere- atmosphere exchange. Based on cross-consistency checks with atmospheric inversions, sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), here we provide a systematic assessment of the latest upscaling efforts for gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the FLUXCOM initiative, where different machine learning methods, forcing data sets and sets of predictor variables were employed. Spatial patterns of mean GPP are consistent across FLUXCOM and DGVM ensembles (R-2 > 0.94 at 1 degrees spatial resolution) while the majority of DGVMs show, for 70 % of the land surface, values outside the FLUXCOM range. Global mean GPP magnitudes for 2008-2010 from FLUXCOM members vary within 106 and 130 PgC yr(-1) with the largest uncertainty in the tropics. Seasonal variations in independent SIF estimates agree better with FLUXCOM GPP (mean global pixel-wise R-2 similar to 0.75) than with GPP from DGVMs (mean global pixel-wise R-2 similar to 0.6). Seasonal variations in FLUXCOM NEE show good consistency with atmospheric inversion-based net land carbon fluxes, particularly for temperate and boreal regions (R-2 > 0.92). Interannual variability of global NEE in FLUXCOM is underestimated compared to inversions and DGVMs. The FLUXCOM version which also uses meteorological inputs shows a strong co-variation in interannual patterns with inversions (R-2 = 0.87 for 2001-2010). Mean regional NEE from FLUXCOM shows larger uptake than inversion and DGVM-based estimates, particularly in the tropics with discrepancies of up to several hundred grammes of carbon per square metre per year. These discrepancies can only partly be reconciled by carbon loss pathways that are implicit in inversions but not captured by the flux tower measurements such as carbon emissions from fires and water bodies. We hypothesize that a combination of systematic biases in the underlying eddy covariance data, in particular in tall tropical forests, and a lack of site history effects on NEE in FLUXCOM are likely responsible for the too strong tropical carbon sink estimated by FLUXCOM. Furthermore, as FLUXCOM does not account for CO2 fertilization effects, carbon flux trends are not realistic. Overall, current FLUXCOM estimates of mean annual and seasonal cycles of GPP as well as seasonal NEE variations provide useful constraints of global carbon cycling, while interannual variability patterns from FLUXCOM are valuable but require cautious interpretation. Exploring the diversity of Earth observation data and of machine learning concepts along with improved quality and quantity of flux tower measurements will facilitate further improvements of the FLUXCOM approach overall.

Specifically, in light of the success of sparse coding based anomaly detection, we propose a Temporally-coherent Sparse Coding (TSC), where a temporally-coherent term is used to preserve the similarity between two similar frames. The optimization of sparse coefficients in TSC with the Sequential Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (SIATA) is equivalent to a special stacked Recurrent Neural Networks (sRNN) architecture. Further, to reduce the computational cost in alternatively updating the dictionary and sparse coefficients in TSC optimization and to alleviate hyperparameters selection in TSC, we stack one more layer on top of the TSC-inspired sRNN to reconstruct the inputs, and arrive at an sRNN-AE. We further improve sRNN-AE in the following aspects: i) rather than using a predefined similarity measurement between two frames, we propose to learn a data-dependent similarity measurement between neighboring frames in sRNN-AE to make it more suitable for anomaly detection; ii) to reduce computational costs in the inference stage, we reduce the depth of the sRNN in sRNN-AE and, consequently, our framework achieves real-time anomaly detection; iii) to improve computational efficiency, we conduct temporal pooling over the appearance features of several consecutive frames for summarizing information temporally, then we feed appearance features and temporally summarized features into a separate sRNN-AE for more robust anomaly detection. To facilitate anomaly detection evaluation, we also build a large-scale anomaly detection dataset which is even larger than the summation of all existing datasets for anomaly detection in terms of both the volume of data and the diversity of scenes. Extensive experiments on both a toy dataset under controlled settings and real datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, which validates the effectiveness of our sRNN-AE method for anomaly detection.

A Universal Probe Set for Targeted Sequencing of 353 Nuclear Genes from Any Flowering Plant Designed Using k-Medoids Clustering	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY			English	Article						Angiosperms; Hyb-Seq; k-means clustering; k-medoids clustering; machine learning; nuclear genes; phylogenomics; sequence capture; target enrichment	MOLECULAR-DATA; SEED PLANTS; DIVERSIFICATION; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; PALEOPOLYPLOIDY; DIVERSITY; PROVIDE; TREES; AGE	Sequencing of target-enriched libraries is an efficient and cost-effective method for obtaining DNA sequence data from hundreds of nuclear loci for phylogeny reconstruction. Much of the cost of developing targeted sequencing approaches is associated with the generation of preliminary data needed for the identification of orthologous loci for probe design. In plants, identifying orthologous loci has proven difficult due to a large number of whole-genome duplication events, especially in the angiosperms (flowering plants). We used multiple sequence alignments from over 600 angiosperms for 353 putatively single-copy protein-coding genes identified by the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative to design a set of targeted sequencing probes for phylogenetic studies of any angiospermgroup. To maximize the phylogenetic potential of the probes, while minimizing the cost of production, we introduce a k-medoids clustering approach to identify the minimum number of sequences necessary to represent each coding sequence in the final probe set. Using this method, 5-15 representative sequences were selected per orthologous locus, representing the sequence diversity of angiosperms more efficiently than if probes were designed using available sequenced genomes alone. To test our approximately 80,000 probes, we hybridized libraries from 42 species spanning all higher-order groups of angiosperms, with a focus on taxa not present in the sequence alignments used to design the probes. Out of a possible 353 coding sequences, we recovered an average of 283 per species and at least 100 in all species. Differences among taxa in sequence recovery could not be explained by relatedness to the representative taxa selected for probe design, suggesting that there is no phylogenetic bias in the probe set. Our probe set, which targeted 260 kbp of coding sequence, achieved a median recovery of 137 kbp per taxon in coding regions, a maximum recovery of 250 kbp, and an additional median of 212 kbp per taxon in flanking non-coding regions across all species. These results suggest that the Angiosperms353 probe set described here is effective for any group of flowering plants and would be useful for phylogenetic studies from the species level to higher-order groups, including the entire angiosperm clade itself.

This paper presents a novel crack assessment framework for concrete structures that detects cracks using mask and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) and quantifies cracks using a few morphological operations on the detected crack masks. In this study, a Mask R-CNN is trained for crack detection using 1,102 crack regions masked on 376 concrete images. The trained Mask R-CNN model is tested on the images taken from a real concrete wall with 453 cracks whose widths range from less than 0.1mm to 1.0mm. The trained model successfully detects most of the cracks 0.3mm or wider. Quantification of the cracks was then carried out using several image-processing operations on 10 randomly selected crack masks. Cracks with widths of 0.3mm or more are quantified successfully with errors less than 0.1mm, whereas cracks less than 0.3mm widths show relatively larger error due to the limitation of image resolution.

Reaction classes facilitate the communication of complex concepts and efficient navigation through chemical reaction space. However, the classification process is a tedious task. It requires identification of the corresponding reaction class template via annotation of the number of molecules in the reactions, the reaction centre and the distinction between reactants and reagents. Here, we show that transformer-based models can infer reaction classes from non-annotated, simple text-based representations of chemical reactions. Our best model reaches a classification accuracy of 98.2%. We also show that the learned representations can be used as reaction fingerprints that capture fine-grained differences between reaction classes better than traditional reaction fingerprints. The insights into chemical reaction space enabled by our learned fingerprints are illustrated by an interactive reaction atlas providing visual clustering and similarity searching.

Artificial intelligence in radiology	NATURE REVIEWS CANCER			English	Review							COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE LEARNING-METHODS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DEEP; CANCER; SEGMENTATION; RADIOMICS; INFORMATION; ACCURACY; IMAGES	Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly deep learning, have demonstrated remarkable progress in image-recognition tasks. Methods ranging from convolutional neural networks to variational autoencoders have found myriad applications in the medical image analysis field, propelling it forward at a rapid pace. Historically, in radiology practice, trained physicians visually assessed medical images for the detection, characterization and monitoring of diseases. AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative, rather than qualitative, assessments of radiographic characteristics. In this Opinion article, we establish a general understanding of AI methods, particularly those pertaining to image-based tasks. We explore how these methods could impact multiple facets of radiology, with a general focus on applications in oncology, and demonstrate ways in which these methods are advancing the field. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing clinical implementation and provide our perspective on how the domain could be advanced.	[Hosny, Ahmed; Parmar, Chintan; Aerts, Hugo J. W.

J	Anwar, S; Barnes, N				Anwar, Saeed; Barnes, Nick			Densely Residual Laplacian Super-Resolution	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Laplace equations; Feature extraction; Computer architecture; Convolutional neural networks; Image restoration; Super-resolution; laplacian attention; multi-scale attention; densely connected residual blocks; deep convolutional neural network		Super-Resolution convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality restoration for single images. However, existing algorithms often require very deep architectures and long training times. Furthermore, current convolutional neural networks for super-resolution are unable to exploit features at multiple scales and weigh them equally or at only static scale only, limiting their learning capability. In this exposition, we present a compact and accurate super-resolution algorithm, namely, densely residual laplacian network (DRLN). The proposed network employs cascading residual on the residual structure to allow the flow of low-frequency information to focus on learning high and mid-level features. In addition, deep supervision is achieved via the densely concatenated residual blocks settings, which also helps in learning from high-level complex features. Moreover, we propose Laplacian attention to model the crucial features to learn the inter and intra-level dependencies between the feature maps. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on low-resolution, noisy low-resolution, and real historical image benchmark datasets illustrate that our DRLN algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods visually and accurately.

Advancing the Mechanical Performance of Glasses: Perspectives and Challenges	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Review						bioinspired composites; glass; hybrid glasses; mechanical properties; oxide glass	SILICA GLASS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; INDENTATION CRACKING; FRACTURE-TOUGHNESS; INTRINSIC STRENGTH; STRUCTURAL-CHANGES; FLEXURAL STRENGTH; BRITTLE-FRACTURE; POISSONS RATIO; SURFACE STRESS	Glasses are materials that lack a crystalline microstructure and long-range atomic order. Instead, they feature heterogeneity and disorder on superstructural scales, which have profound consequences for their elastic response, material strength, fracture toughness, and the characteristics of dynamic fracture. These structure-property relations present a rich field of study in fundamental glass physics and are also becoming increasingly important in the design of modern materials with improved mechanical performance. A first step in this direction involves glass-like materials that retain optical transparency and the haptics of classical glass products, while overcoming the limitations of brittleness. Among these, novel types of oxide glasses, hybrid glasses, phase-separated glasses, and bioinspired glass-polymer composites hold significant promise. Such materials are designed from the bottom-up, building on structure-property relations, modeling of stresses and strains at relevant length scales, and machine learning predictions. Their fabrication requires a more scientifically driven approach to materials design and processing, building on the physics of structural disorder and its consequences for structural rearrangements, defect initiation, and dynamic fracture in response to mechanical load. In this article, a perspective is provided on this highly interdisciplinary field of research in terms of its most recent challenges and opportunities.

Thus, different advanced approaches using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models were applied, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), M5 Tree (M5Tree), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Locally Weighted Polynomials (LWP), Kriging (KR), and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Additionally, a total of 259 measurement samples of maximum pitting corrosion depth for pipelines located in different environments were extracted from the literature and used for developing the AI-models in terms of training and testing.Furthermore, an investigation was carried out on the relationship between the maximum pitting depths and several combinations of probable factors that induce the pitting growth process such as the pipeline age, and the surrounding environmental properties. The results of the proposed AI-frameworks were compared using various criteria. Thus, statistical, uncertainty and external validation analyses were utilized to compare the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed AI-models and to investigate the main contributing factors for accurate predictions of the maximum pitting depth in the oil and gas pipeline.

Genome-wide cell-free DNA fragmentation in patients with cancer	NATURE			English	Article							PLASMA DNA; CIRCULATING DNA; INTEGRITY; ABERRATIONS	Cell-free DNA in the blood provides a non-invasive diagnostic avenue for patients with cancer'. However, characteristics of the origins and molecular features of cell-free DNA are poorly understood. Here we developed an approach to evaluate fragmentation patterns of cell-free DNA across the genome, and found that profiles of healthy individuals reflected nucleosomal patterns of white blood cells, whereas patients with cancer had altered fragmentation profiles. We used this method to analyse the fragmentation profiles of 236 patients with breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric or bile duct cancer and 245 healthy individuals. A machine learning model that incorporated genome-wide fragmentation features had sensitivities of detection ranging from 57% to more than 99% among the seven cancer types at 98% specificity, with an overall area under the curve value of 0.94. Fragmentation profiles could be used to identify the tissue of origin of the cancers to a limited number of sites in 75% of cases. Combining our approach with mutation-based cell-free DNA analyses detected 91% of patients with cancer. The results of these analyses highlight important properties of cell-free DNA and provide a proof-of-principle approach for the screening, early detection and monitoring of human cancer.

BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							MINOR ALLELE FREQUENCY; VARIABLE SELECTION; RANDOM FORESTS; EXPRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; RANKING; IMPACT	Motivation: Random forests are fast, flexible and represent a robust approach to analyze high dimensional data. A key advantage over alternative machine learning algorithms are variable importance measures, which can be used to identify relevant features or perform variable selection. Measures based on the impurity reduction of splits, such as the Gini importance, are popular because they are simple and fast to compute. However, they are biased in favor of variables with many possible split points and high minor allele frequency. Results: We set up a fast approach to debias impurity-based variable importance measures for classification, regression and survival forests. We show that it creates a variable importance measure which is unbiased with regard to the number of categories and minor allele frequency and almost as fast as the standard impurity importance. As a result, it is now possible to compute reliable importance estimates without the extra computing cost of permutations. Further, we combine the importance measure with a fast testing procedure, producing p-values for variable importance with almost no computational overhead to the creation of the random forest. Applications to gene expression and genome-wide association data show that the proposed method is powerful and computationally efficient.

A feature selection (FS) algorithm called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is proposed to abstract the correlated input parameters for the Pb prediction and validated against principal component of analysis (PCA), recursive feature elimination (RFE), and the genetic algorithm (GA). XGBoost model is applied using a grid search strategy (Grid-XGBoost) for predicting Pb and validated against the commonly used AI models, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The input parameter selection approaches redimensioned the 21 parameters into 9-5 parameters without losing their learned information over the models' training phase. At the BB station, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values (0.06, 0.32, 0.34, and 0.33) were achieved for the XGBoost-SVM, XGBoost-ANN, XGBoost-Grid-XGBoost, and Grid-XGBoost models, respectively. At the DB station, the lowest MAPE values, 0.25 and 0.24, were attained for the XGBoost-Grid-XGBoost and Grid-XGBoost models, respectively. Overall, the proposed hybrid AI models provided a reliable and robust computer aid technology for sediment Pb prediction that contribute to the best knowledge of environmental pollution monitoring and assessment.

Mechano-acoustic sensing of physiological processes and body motions via a soft wireless device placed at the suprasternal notch	NATURE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							RESPIRATORY RATE; TIME; SIGNALS; SENSOR; PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAM; POSITION; PRONE	Skin-mounted soft electronics that incorporate high-bandwidth triaxial accelerometers can capture broad classes of physiologically relevant information, including mechano-acoustic signatures of underlying body processes (such as those measured by a stethoscope) and precision kinematics of core-body motions. Here, we describe a wireless device designed to be conformally placed on the suprasternal notch for the continuous measurement of mechano-acoustic signals, from subtle vibrations of the skin at accelerations of around 10(-3)ms(-2) to large motions of the entire body at about 10ms(-2), and at frequencies up to around 800Hz. Because the measurements are a complex superposition of signals that arise from locomotion, body orientation, swallowing, respiration, cardiac activity, vocal-fold vibrations and other sources, we exploited frequency-domain analysis and machine learning to obtain-from human subjects during natural daily activities and exercise-real-time recordings of heart rate, respiration rate, energy intensity and other essential vital signs, as well as talking time and cadence, swallow counts and patterns, and other unconventional biomarkers. We also used the device in sleep laboratories and validated the measurements using polysomnography. A wireless device designed to be conformally placed on the suprasternal notch can continuously provide real-time information of essential vital signs as well as talking time, swallow counts and sleep patterns.

Each of the million or so crystal structures in the database was solved for its own particular reason, but collected together, the structures can be reused to address a multitude of new problems. In this Review, which is focused mainly on the last 10 years, we chronicle the contribution of the CSD to research into molecular geometries, molecular interactions, and molecular assemblies and demonstrate its value in the design of biologically active molecules and the solid forms in which they are delivered. Its potential in other commercially relevant areas is described, including gas storage and delivery, thin films, and (opto)electronics. The CSD also aids the solution of new crystal structures. Because no scientific instrument is without shortcomings, the limitations of CSD research are assessed. We emphasize the importance of maintaining database quality: notwithstanding the arrival of big data and machine learning, it remains perilous to ignore the principle of garbage in, garbage out. Finally, we explain why the CSD must evolve with the world around it to ensure it remains fit for purpose in the years ahead.

Brain age predicts mortality	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							LOTHIAN BIRTH COHORT; GRIP STRENGTH; OLD-AGE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EPIGENETIC CLOCK; ALLOSTATIC LOAD; BIOLOGICAL RISK; LATER LIFE; FOLLOW-UP; POPULATION	Age-associated disease and disability are placing a growing burden on society. However, ageing does not affect people uniformly. Hence, markers of the underlying biological ageing process are needed to help identify people at increased risk of age-associated physical and cognitive impairments and ultimately, death. Here, we present such a biomarker, 'brain-predicted age', derived using structural neuroimaging. Brain-predicted age was calculated using machine-learning analysis, trained on neuroimaging data from a large healthy reference sample (N = 2001), then tested in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N = 669), to determine relationships with age-associated functional measures and mortality. Having a brain-predicted age indicative of an older-appearing brain was associated with: weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load and increased mortality risk. Furthermore, while combining brain-predicted age with grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (themselves strong predictors) not did improve mortality risk prediction, the combination of brain-predicted age and DNA-methylation-predicted age did. This indicates that neuroimaging and epigenetics measures of ageing can provide complementary data regarding health outcomes. Our study introduces a clinically-relevant neuroimaging ageing biomarker and demonstrates that combining distinct measurements of biological ageing further helps to determine risk of age-related deterioration and death.

Traditional long text topic modeling algorithms (e.g., PLSA and LDA) based on word co-occurrences cannot solve this problem very well since only very limited word co-occurrence information is available in short texts. Therefore, short text topic modeling has already attracted much attention from the machine learning research community in recent years, which aims at overcoming the problem of sparseness in short texts. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of various short text topic modeling techniques proposed in the literature. We present three categories of methods based on Dirichlet multinomial mixture, global word co-occurrences, and self-aggregation, with example of representative approaches in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We develop the first comprehensive open-source library, called STTM, for use in Java that integrates all surveyed algorithms within a unified interface, benchmark datasets, to facilitate the expansion of new methods in this research field. Finally, we evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on many real-world datasets and compare their performance against one another and versus long text topic modeling algorithm.

The ushering of the Medicine 4.0 has resulted in an increased effort to develop platforms, both at the hardware level as well as the underlying software level. This vision has led to the development of Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) systems. The basic enabling technologies include the communication systems between the sensing nodes and the processors; and the processing algorithms for generating an output from the data collected by the sensors. However, at present, these enabling technologies are also supported by several new technologies. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the H-IoT systems at almost every level. The fog/edge paradigm is bringing the computing power close to the deployed network and hence mitigating many challenges in the process. While the big data allows handling an enormous amount of data. Additionally, the Software Defined Networks (SDNs) bring flexibility to the system while the blockchains are finding the most novel use cases in H-IoT systems. The Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and Tactile Internet (TI) are driving the innovation in the H-IoT applications. This paper delves into the ways these technologies are transforming the H-IoT systems and also identifies the future course for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) using these new technologies.

Compared with polymer nanocomposites with widespread attention, all-organic polymers are fundamental and have been proven to be more effective choices in the process of scalable, continuous, and large-scale industrial production, leading to many dielectric and energy storage applications. In the past decade, efforts have intensified in this field with great progress in newly discovered dielectric polymers, fundamental production technologies, and extension toward emerging computational strategies. This review summarizes the recent progress in the field of energy storage based on conventional as well as heat-resistant all-organic polymer materials with the focus on strategies to enhance the dielectric properties and energy storage performances. The key parameters of all-organic polymers, such as dielectric constant, dielectric loss, breakdown strength, energy density, and charge-discharge efficiency, have been thoroughly studied. In addition, the applications of computer-aided calculation including density functional theory, machine learning, and materials genome in rational design and performance prediction of polymer dielectrics are reviewed in detail. Based on a comprehensive understanding of recent developments, guidelines and prospects for the future development of all-organic polymer materials with dielectric and energy storage applications are proposed.

As an important means of data processing in 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNets), data fusion technology is faced with a large number of malicious code attacks. Thus, it is particularly important to find an efficient malicious code detection method. However, in the traditional research, due to dataset imbalance, the complexity of the deep learning network model, the use of a single-objective algorithm, and other factors, it brings greater loss and lower detection accuracy. Therefore, how to choose a suitable network model and improve the data classification accuracy in HetNets is a big challenge. To enhance the model's robustness, a multi-objective restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) model is designed for training. In this article, evaluation indices are used to comprehensively measure the effect of data classification, introducing a strategy pool to improve the effect of data fusion and using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA-II) to deal with the imbalanced malware family. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-objective RBM model combined with NSGA-II can effectively enhance the data classification accuracy of HetNets and reduce the loss in the process of data fusion.

When trying to convert experiment into practice, one finds that sulfur cathodes, especially a cyclic octasulfur cathode, and lithium metal anodes present several problems, including sulfur shuttling, the fact that S is an insulator, complex 16-electron reactions, and the formation of lithium dendrites. In recent years, organosulfur compounds have been extensively investigated for Li-S batteries in order to solve these problems and understand the electrochemical process during their redox reactions. This review aims to summarize the different functions of organosulfur compounds, and figure out a guideline for understanding and using them in Li-S batteries. The organosulfur compounds currently used as active materials are classified into three types based on their electrochemical behavior, and design principles of the molecular and polymer structures of organosulfur compounds are concluded. Based on these design principles, we summarize how to control their electrochemical performance, and suggest possible electrochemical mechanisms and other characteristics. Finally, we propose guidelines for the development of promising organosulfur compounds using emerging technologies, including advanced characterization techniques, innovative methods of synthesis of such compounds, and machine-learning techniques.

We aim to understand how this literature has evolved and propose future research opportunities. We focus on four smart dimensions of Industry 4.0: Smart Manufacturing, Smart Products and Services, Smart Supply Chain, and Smart Working. We perform a machine learning-based systematic literature review. Our analysis included 4,973 papers published from 2011 to 2020. We conducted a chronological network analysis considering the growth of these four dimensions and the connections between them. We also analyzed keywords and the main journals publishing on these four smart dimensions. We show that the literature has mainly been devoted to the study of Smart Manufacturing, although attention to the other smart dimensions has been growing in recent years. Smart Working is the less explored dimension, with many opportunities for future research. We show that research opportunities are concentrated in the interfaces between the different smart dimensions. Our findings support the vision of Industry 4.0 as a concept transcending the Smart Manufacturing field, thus creating opportunities for synergies with other related fields. Scholars can use our findings to understand the orientation of journals and gaps that can be fulfilled by future research.

Clustering algorithms: A comparative approach	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SOM NEURAL-NETWORK; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL METHODS; R-PACKAGE; MODEL; SELECTION; KERNEL	Many real-world systems can be studied in terms of pattern recognition tasks, so that proper use (and understanding) of machine learning methods in practical applications becomes essential. While many classification methods have been proposed, there is no consensus on which methods are more suitable for a given dataset. As a consequence, it is important to comprehensively compare methods in many possible scenarios. In this context, we performed a systematic comparison of 9 well-known clustering methods available in the R language assuming normally distributed data. In order to account for the many possible variations of data, we considered artificial datasets with several tunable properties (number of classes, separation between classes, etc). In addition, we also evaluated the sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default configurations of the adopted methods, the spectral approach tended to present particularly good performance. We also found that the default configuration of the adopted implementations was not always accurate. In these cases, a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a good alternative to improve the performance. All in all, the reported approach provides subsidies guiding the choice of clustering algorithms.

Despite their widespread adoption in many applications, we are still researching using suggested methods to solve real-world problems. As a result, researchers must significantly adjust and refine their procedures based on the main evolutionary processes to ensure faster convergence, consistent equilibrium with high-quality results, and optimization. Thus, a new hybrid method using Aquila optimizer (AO) and arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) is proposed in this paper. AO and AOA are both modern meta-heuristic optimization methods. They can be applied to different problems, including image processing, machine learning, wireless networks, power systems, engineering design etc. The proposed approach is examined concerning AO and AOA. To determine results, each procedure is evaluated using the same parameters, such as population size and several iterations. By changing the dimensions, the proposed approach (AO-AOA) is evaluated. The impact of varying dimensions is a standard test that has been used in previous studies to optimize test functions that demonstrate the influence of varying dimensions on the efficiency of AO-AOA. It is clear from this that it fits well with both high- and low-dimensional problems. Population-based methods achieve efficient search results in high-dimensional problems.

We compared the performance of conventional (C)-SPECT and cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT)-SPECT systems in women with low-intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods and Results A total of 109 consecutive women underwent stress-optional rest MPI by both C-SPECT and CZT-SPECT. In the overall study population, a weak albeit significant correlation between total perfusion defect (TPD) measured by C-SPECT and CZT-SPECT was observed (r = 0.38, P < .001) and at Bland-Altman analysis the mean difference in TPD (C-SPECT minus CZT-SPECT) was 2.40% (P < .001). Overall concordance of semi-quantitative diagnostic performance between C-SPECT and CZT-SPECT was observed in 52 (48%) women with a kappa value of 0.09. Normalcy rate was significantly higher using CZT-SPECT compared to C-SPECT (P < .001). Machine learning analysis performed through the implementation of J48 algorithm proved that CZT-SPECT has higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy than C-SPECT. Conclusions In women with low-intermediate likelihood of CAD, there is a poor concordance of diagnostic performance between C-SPECT and CZT-SPECT, and CZT-SPECT allows better normalcy rate detection compared to C-SPECT.

J	Wen, L; Li, XY; Gao, L; Zhang, YY				Wen, Long; Li, Xinyu; Gao, Liang; Zhang, Yuyan			A New Convolutional Neural Network-Based Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Convolutional neural network (CNN); data-driven; fault diagnosis; image classification	MODEL; SIGNAL	Fault diagnosis is vital in manufacturing system, since early detections on the emerging problem can save invaluable time and cost. With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes a hot topic. However, the traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods rely on the features extracted by experts. The feature extraction process is an exhausted work and greatly impac7ts the final result. Deep learning (DL) provides an effective way to extract the features of raw data automatically. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective DL method. In this study, a new CNN based on LeNet-5 is proposed for fault diagnosis. Through a conversion method converting signals into two-dimensional (2-D) images, the proposed method can extract the features of the converted 2-D images and eliminate the effect of handcrafted features. The proposed method which is tested on three famous datasets, including motor bearing dataset, self-priming centrifugal pump dataset, and axial piston hydraulic pump dataset, has achieved prediction accuracy of 99.79%, 99.481%, and 100%, respectively. The results have been compared with other DL and traditional methods, including adaptive deep CNN, sparse filter, deep belief network, and support vector machine. The comparisons show that the proposed CNN-based data-driven fault diagnosis method has achieved significant improvements.

AffectNet: A Database for Facial Expression, Valence, and Arousal Computing in the Wild	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						Affective computing in the wild; facial expressions; continuous dimensional space; valence; arousal	FACE; RECOGNITION; EMOTION; MODEL	Automated affective computing in the wild setting is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing annotated databases of facial expressions in the wild are small and mostly cover discrete emotions (aka the categorical model). There are very limited annotated facial databases for affective computing in the continuous dimensional model (e.g., valence and arousal). To meet this need, we collected, annotated, and prepared for public distribution a new database of facial emotions in the wild (called AffectNet). AffectNet contains more than 1,000,000 facial images from the Internet by querying three major search engines using 1,250 emotion related keywords in six different languages. About half of the retrieved images were manually annotated for the presence of seven discrete facial expressions and the intensity of valence and arousal. AffectNet is by far the largest database of facial expression, valence, and arousal in the wild enabling research in automated facial expression recognition in two different emotion models. Two baseline deep neural networks are used to classify images in the categorical model and predict the intensity of valence and arousal. Various evaluation metrics show that our deep neural network baselines can perform better than conventional machine learning methods and off-the-shelf facial expression recognition systems.

Though the National Lung Screening Trial argues for screening of certain at-risk populations, the practical implementation of these screening efforts has not yet been successful and remains in high demand. Radiomics refers to the computerized extraction of data from radiologic images, and provides unique potential for making lung cancer screening more rapid and accurate using machine learning algorithms. The quantitative features analyzed express subvisual characteristics of images which correlate with pathogenesis of diseases. These features are broadly classified into four categories: intensity, structure, texture/gradient, and wavelet, based on the types of image attributes they capture. Many studies have been done to show correlation between these features and the malignant potential of a nodule on a chest CT. In cancer patients, these nodules also have features that can be correlated with prognosis and mutation status. The major limitations of radiomics are the lack of standardization of acquisition parameters, inconsistent radiomic methods, and lack of reproducibility. Researchers are working on overcoming these limitations, which would make radiomics more acceptable in the medical community.

However, it is often inconvenient to use individual Mueller matrix elements to characterize the microstructure due to a lack of explicit connections between the matrix elements and the physics properties of the scattering samples. In this review, we summarize the methods to derive groups of polarization parameters, which have clear physical meanings and associations with certain structural properties of turbid media, including various Mueller matrix decomposition (MMD) methods and the Mueller matrix transformation (MMT) technique. Previously, experimentalists have chosen the most suitable method for the specific measurement scheme. In this review, we introduce an emerging novel research paradigm called 'polaromics'. In this paradigm, both MMD and MMT parameters are considered as polarimetry basis parameters (PBP), which are used to construct polarimetry feature parameters (PFPs) for the quantitative characterization of complex biomedical samples. Machine learning techniques are involved to find PFPs that are sensitive to specific micro- or macrostructural features. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the emerging 'polaromics' paradigm, which may pave the way for biomedical and clinical applications of polarimetry.

BA leverages the echolocation feature of bats produced by imitating the bats' searching behavior. BA faces premature convergence due to its local search capability. Instead of using the standard uniform walk, the Torus walk is viewed as a promising alternative to improve the local search capability. In this work, we proposed an improved variation of BA by applying torus walk to improve diversity and convergence. The proposed. Modern Computerized Bat Algorithm (MCBA) approach has been examined for fifteen well-known benchmark test problems. The finding of our technique shows promising performance as compared to the standard PSO and standard BA. The proposed MCBA, BPA, Standard PSO, and Standard BA have been examined for well-known benchmark test problems and training of the artificial neural network (ANN). We have performed experiments using eight benchmark datasets applied from the worldwide famous machine-learning (ML) repository of UCI. Simulation results have shown that the training of an ANN with MCBA-NN algorithm tops the list considering exactness, with more superiority compared to the traditional methodologies. The MCBA-NN algorithm may be used effectively for data classification and statistical problems in the future.

In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment.

However, the low current density, competitive H-2 evolution reaction and uncontrollable product distribution are urgent to be solved. Benefiting from the well-defined active centers in single atom catalysts (SACs), the coordination bond, bond length/angle, etc. can be modulated to affect the selectivity/ activity towards the CO2RR, which relies on electron transfer, adsorption states and so on. Hence, an in-depth summary about the regulation of the coordination structure for the CO2RR is significant and pressing. This review concentrates on the manipulation of central atoms and coordination atoms on carbon and other supports in SACs for the CO2RR. As a prototype, a definitive correlation between the structure and XAFS spectra characteristics was properly decoded. Then, the influence of the coordination atoms and coordination number on the current density, reduction products, reaction path, etc., is highlighted. Finally, prospects such as identification of the coordination structure, machine learning, fine adjustment of the coordination atoms and control of the product distribution were put forward. This Review contributes profound insights for the rational design of the coordination structure towards highly efficient and even guided electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.

Research in the field of machine learning has been exploring the use of random forest as a framework within which many traffic and transport problems can be investigated. The random forest (RF) is a powerful method for constructing an ensemble of random decision trees. It de-correlates the decision trees in the ensemble via randomization that leads to an improvement of forecasting and reduces the variance when averaged over the trees. However, the usefulness of RF for travel mode choice behavior remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a robust random forest method to analyze travel mode choices for examining the prediction capability and model interpretability. Using the travel diary data from Nanjing, China in 2013, enriched with variables on the built environment, the effects of different model parameters on the prediction performance are investigated. The comparison results show that the random forest method performs significantly better in travel mode choice prediction for higher accuracy and less computation cost. In addition, the proposed method estimates the relative importance of explanatory variables and how they relate to mode choices. This is fundamental for a better understanding and effective modeling of people's travel behavior.

Identification of primate sensory neuron types is critical for understanding the cellular origin and heritability of chronic pain. However, molecular insights into the primate sensory neurons are missing. Here we classify non-human primate dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons based on their transcriptome and map human pain heritability to neuronal types. First, we identified cell correlates between two major datasets for mouse sensory neuron types. Machine learning exposes an overall cross-species conservation of somatosensory neurons between primate and mouse, although with differences at individual gene level, highlighting the importance of primate data for clinical translation. We map genomic loci associated with chronic pain in human onto primate sensory neuron types to identify the cellular origin of chronic pain. Genome-wide associations for chronic pain converge on two different neuronal types distributed between pain disorders that display different genetic susceptibilities, suggesting both unique and shared mechanisms between different pain conditions. The contribution of distinct types of dorsal root ganglion neurons to chronic pain is unclear. Here, the authors molecularly profile non-human primate sensory neurons and show that genome-wide associations converge on two neuronal types with different genetic susceptibilities for chronic pain.

Accordingly, the possibility of quantum enhanced optimization has driven much interest in quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate the application of the Google Sycamore superconducting qubit quantum processor to combinatorial optimization problems with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Like past QAOA experiments, we study performance for problems defined on the planar connectivity graph native to our hardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and MaxCut, non-native problems that require extensive compilation to implement. For hardware-native problems, which are classically efficient to solve on average, we obtain an approximation ratio that is independent of problem size and observe that performance increases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance decreases with problem size. Circuits involving several thousand gates still present an advantage over random guessing but not over some efficient classical algorithms. Our results suggest that it will be challenging to scale near-term implementations of the QAOA for problems on non-native graphs. As these graphs are closer to real-world instances, we suggest more emphasis should be placed on such problems when using the QAOA to benchmark quantum processors.

J	Liang, HY; Chen, L; Zhao, X; Zhang, XL				Liang, Haiyan; Chen, Lei; Zhao, Xian; Zhang, Xiaolin			Prediction of Drug Side Effects with a Refined Negative Sample Selection Strategy	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							INFORMATION; IDENTIFICATION; INTEGRATION; NETWORK; GENES	Drugs are an important way to treat various diseases. However, they inevitably produce side effects, bringing great risks to human bodies and pharmaceutical companies. How to predict the side effects of drugs has become one of the essential problems in drug research. Designing efficient computational methods is an alternative way. Some studies paired the drug and side effect as a sample, thereby modeling the problem as a binary classification problem. However, the selection of negative samples is a key problem in this case. In this study, a novel negative sample selection strategy was designed for accessing high-quality negative samples. Such strategy applied the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm on a chemical-chemical interaction network to select pairs of drugs and side effects, such that drugs were less likely to have corresponding side effects, as negative samples. Through several tests with a fixed feature extraction scheme and different machine-learning algorithms, models with selected negative samples produced high performance. The best model even yielded nearly perfect performance. These models had much higher performance than those without such strategy or with another selection strategy. Furthermore, it is not necessary to consider the balance of positive and negative samples under such a strategy.

Prediction of wind speed and wind direction using artificial neural network, support vector regression and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS			English	Article						Wind energy; Wind direction; Support vector regression; ANFIS; Partial swarm optimization	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; TIME-SERIES PREDICTION; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; EXERGY ANALYSIS; ENERGY; POWER; OPTIMIZATION; WAVELET; REGION; SELECTION	In this study, three models of machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict wind speed, wind direction and output power of a wind turbine. The first model is multilayer feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN) that is trained with different data training algorithms. The second model is support vector regression with a radial basis function (SVR-RBF). The third model is adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that is optimized with a partial swarm optimization algorithm (ANFIS-PSO). Temperature, pressure, relative humidity and local time are considered as input variables of the models. A large set of wind speed and wind direction data measured at 5-min, 10-min, 30-min and 1-h intervals are utilized to accurately predict wind speed and its direction for Bushehr. Energy and exergy analysis of wind energy for a wind turbine (E-44, 900 kW) is done. Also, the developed models are used to predict the output power of the wind turbine. Comparison of the statistical indices for the predicted and actual data indicate that the SVR-RBF model outperforms the MLFFNN and ANFIS-PSO models. Also, the current energy and exergy analysis presents an average of 32% energy efficiency and approximately 25% exergy efficiency of the wind turbine in the study region.	[Khosravi, A.; Koury, R. N.

Currently, electrochemical mechanism based models require huge computation effort for solving partial differential equations, equivalent circuit models do not consider actual battery mechanism, while machine learning models are lack of generalization ability due to their data-driven nature. All these problems bring the challenges to guarantee the model effectiveness in wide temperature and large current conditions. To estimate the battery state of charge (SOC) and state of temperature (SOT) under these conditions, an electrochemical-thermal-neuralnetwork (ETNN) model is formulated in this paper. Specifically, a simplified single particle model and a lumped thermal model are served as the sub-models of ETNN to predict core temperature and provide approximate terminal voltage. Then a neural network is incorporated to enhance the performance of sub-models. According to the extensive experiments, ETNN model is able to accurately estimate battery voltage and core temperature under the ambient temperatures of -10-40 degrees C and the discharge rate of 10-C. After that, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is integrated with ETNN to achieve reliable co-estimation of SOC-SOT. Experimental results illustrate that proposed ETNN-UKF can rapidly eliminate initial errors and provide satisfactory co-estimation performance.

The genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease	LANCET NEUROLOGY			English	Review							CELL RNA-SEQ; ASSOCIATION; PROGRESSION; PREDICTION; MUTATIONS; VARIANTS; SCALE; LRP10; MOTOR; SCORE	Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder for which both rare and common genetic variants contribute to disease risk, onset, and progression. Mutations in more than 20 genes have been associated with the disease, most of which are highly penetrant and often cause early onset or atypical symptoms. Although our understanding of the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease has advanced considerably, much remains to be done. Further disease-related common genetic variability remains to be identified and the work in identifying rare risk alleles has only just begun. To date, genome-wide association studies have identified 90 independent risk-associated variants. However, most of them have been identified in patients of European ancestry and we know relatively little of the genetics of Parkinson's disease in other populations. We have a limited understanding of the biological functions of the risk alleles that have been identified, although Parkinson's disease risk variants appear to be in close proximity to known Parkinson's disease genes and lysosomal-related genes. In the past decade, multiple efforts have been made to investigate the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease, and emerging technologies, such as machine learning, single-cell RNA sequencing, and high-throughput screens, will improve our understanding of genetic risk.

The Prognostic Role of Macrophage Polarization in the Colorectal Cancer Microenvironment	CANCER IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; GENE-EXPRESSION; ACTIVATION; SURVIVAL; MUTATION; MARKERS; CELLS	Macrophages are among the most common cells in the colorectal cancer microenvironment, but their prognostic significance is incompletely understood. Using multiplexed immunofluorescence for CD68, CD86, IRF5, MAF, MRC1 (CD206), and KRT (cytokeratins) combined with digital image analysis and machine learning, we assessed the polarization spectrum of tumor-associated macrophages in 931 colorectal carcinomas. We then applied Cox proportional hazards regression to assess prognostic survival associations of intraepithelial and stromal densities of M1-like and M2-like macrophages while controlling for potential confounders, including stage and microsatellite instability status. We found that high tumor Aromal density of M2-like macrophages was associated with worse cancer-specific survival, whereas tumor stromal density of M1-like macrophages was not significantly associated with better cancer-specific survival. High M1:M2 density ratio in tumor stroma was associated with better cancer-specific survival. Over-all macrophage densities in tumor intraepithelial or stromal regions were not prognostic. These findings suggested that macrophage polarization state, rather than their overall density, was associated with cancer-specific survival, with M1- and M2-like macrophage phenotypes exhibiting distinct prognostic roles. These results highlight the utility of a multimarker strategy to assess the macrophage polarization at single-cell resolution within the tumor microenvironment.

Building on this, we highlight the dangers of a publication culture that continues to demand large effects. First, it rewards inflated effects that are unlikely to be real and encourages practices likely to yield such effects. Second, it overlooks the small effects that are most likely to be real, hindering attempts to identify and understand the actual determinants of complex psychological phenomena. We then explain the theoretical and practical relevance of small effects, which can have substantial consequences, especially when considered at scale and over time. Finally, we suggest ways in which scholars can harness these insights to advance research and practices in psychology (i.e., leveraging the power of big data, machine learning, and crowdsourcing science; promoting rigorous preregistration, including prespecifying the smallest effect size of interest; contextualizing effects; changing cultural norms to reward accurate and meaningful effects rather than exaggerated and unreliable effects). Only once small effects are accepted as the norm, rather than the exception, can a reliable and reproducible cumulative psychological science be built.

A global review of publicly available datasets for ophthalmological imaging: barriers to access, usability, and generalisability	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Review							DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; DISEASES; CANCER; SYSTEM	Health data that are publicly available are valuable resources for digital health research. Several public datasets containing ophthalmological imaging have been frequently used in machine learning research; however, the total number of datasets containing ophthalmological health information and their respective content is unclear. This Review aimed to identify all publicly available ophthalmological imaging datasets, detail their accessibility, describe which diseases and populations are represented, and report on the completeness of the associated metadata. With the use of MEDLINE, Google's search engine, and Google Dataset Search, we identified 94 open access datasets containing 507 724 images and 125 videos from 122 364 patients. Most datasets originated from Asia, North America, and Europe. Disease populations were unevenly represented, with glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration disproportionately overrepresented in comparison with other eye diseases. The reporting of basic demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and ethnicity was poor, even at the aggregate level. This Review provides greater visibility for ophthalmological datasets that are publicly available as powerful resources for research. Our paper also exposes an increasing divide in the representation of different population and disease groups in health data repositories. The improved reporting of metadata would enable researchers to access the most appropriate datasets for their needs and maximise the potential of such resources.

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.

MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; DIAGNOSTIC OBSERVATION SCHEDULE; DISORDER; CHILDREN; PHENOTYPE; TRAITS; INDIVIDUALS; PREVALENCE; PERCEPTION; CATEGORIES	The current diagnostic practices are linked to a 20-fold increase in the reported prevalence of ASD over the last 30 years. Fragmenting the autism phenotype into dimensional "autistic traits" results in the alleged recognition of autism-like symptoms in any psychiatric or neurodevelopemental condition and in individuals decreasingly distant from the typical population, and prematurely dismisses the relevance of a diagnostic threshold. Non-specific socio-communicative and repetitive DSM 5 criteria, combined with four quantitative specifiers as well as all their possible combinations, render limitless variety of presentations consistent with the categorical diagnosis of ASD. We propose several remedies to this problem: maintain a line of research on prototypical autism; limit the heterogeneity compatible with a categorical diagnosis to situations with a phenotypic overlap and a validated etiological link with prototypical autism; reintroduce the qualitative properties of autism presentations and of current dimensional specifiers, language, intelligence, comorbidity, and severity in the criteria used to diagnose autism in replacement of quantitative "social" and "repetitive" criteria; use these qualitative features combined with the clinical intuition of experts and machine-learning algorithms to differentiate coherent subgroups in today's autism spectrum; study these subgroups separately, and then compare them; and question the autistic nature of "autistic traits"	[Mottron, Laurent] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychiat, 7070 Perras Boul, Montreal, PQ H1E 1A4, Canada; [Mottron, Laurent] Riviere des Prairies Hosp, CIUSSS NIM, 7070 Perras Boul, Montreal, PQ H1E 1A4, Canada; [Bzdok, Danilo] McGill Univ, Fac Med, Montreal Neurol Inst, Dept Biomed Engn,McConnell Brain Imaging Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3A 2B4, Canada; [Bzdok, Danilo] Mila Quebec Artificial Intelligence Inst, Montreal, PQ H2S 3H1, Canada		Mottron, L (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Psychiat, 7070 Perras Boul, Montreal, PQ H1E 1A4, Canada.; Mottron, L (corresponding author), Riviere des Prairies Hosp, CIUSSS NIM, 7070 Perras Boul, Montreal, PQ H1E 1A4, Canada.

Bat algorithm is a relatively new stochastic optimizer inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats in nature. Due to its effectiveness, it has been applied to many fields such as engineering design, feature selection, and machine learning. However, the classical approach is often prone to falling into local optima. This paper proposes an enhanced bat algorithm to alleviate this problem observed in the original algorithm. The proposed method controls the steps of chaotic mapping by a threshold and synchronizes the velocity of agents using a velocity inertia weight. These mechanisms are designed to boost the stability and convergence speed of the bat algorithm, instantly. Eighteen well-established and the state-of-the-art meta-heuristic approaches are considered to validate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. Experimental results reveal that the proposed chaos-enhanced bat algorithm is not only superior to the well-established algorithms such as the original method but also the latest improved approaches. Also, the proposed method is successfully applied to I-beam design problems, welded beam design, and pressure vessel design. The results show that chaos-enhanced bat algorithm can deal with unconstrained and constrained feature spaces, effectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we provide a guide to help researchers navigate the consequential decisions they need to make before any measure can be produced from the text. We consider, both theoretically and empirically, the effects of such choices using as a running example efforts to measure the tone of New York Times coverage of the economy. We show that two reasonable approaches to corpus selection yield radically different corpora and we advocate for the use of keyword searches rather than predefined subject categories provided by news archives. We demonstrate the benefits of coding using article segments instead of sentences as units of analysis. We show that, given a fixed number of codings, it is better to increase the number of unique documents coded rather than the number of coders for each document. Finally, we find that supervised machine learning algorithms outperform dictionaries on a number of criteria. Overall, we intend this guide to serve as a reminder to analysts that thoughtfulness and human validation are key to text-as-data methods, particularly in an age when it is all too easy to computationally classify texts without attending to the methodological choices therein.

Interannual variability of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink is substantially regulated by various environmental variables and highly dominates the interannual variation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Thus, it is necessary to determine dominating factors affecting the interannual variability of the carbon sink to improve our capability of predicting future terrestrial carbon sinks. Using global datasets derived from machine-learning methods and process-based ecosystem models, this study reveals that the interannual variability of the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was significantly negatively correlated with net ecosystem production (NEP) and substantially impacted the interannual variability of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate (CGR). Further analyses found widespread constraints of VPD interannual variability on terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), causing VPD to impact NEP and CGR. Partial correlation analysis confirms the persistent and widespread impacts of VPD on terrestrial carbon sinks compared to other environmental variables. Current Earth system models underestimate the interannual variability in VPD and its impacts on GPP and NEP. Our results highlight the importance of VPD for terrestrial carbon sinks in assessing ecosystems' responses to future climate conditions.

Newly compiled satellite data and machine learning now allow us to track individual fishing vessels on the high seas in near real time. These technological advances help us quantify high-seas fishing effort, costs, and benefits, and assess whether, where, and when high-seas fishing makes economic sense. We characterize the global high-seas fishing fleet and report the economic benefits of fishing the high seas globally, nationally, and at the scale of individual fleets. Our results suggest that fishing at the current scale is enabled by large government subsidies, without which as much as 54% of the present high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable at current fishing rates. The patterns of fishing profitability vary widely between countries, types of fishing, and distance to port. Deep-sea bottom trawling often produces net economic benefits only thanks to subsidies, and much fishing by the world's largest fishing fleets would largely be unprofitable without subsidies and low labor costs. These results support recent calls for subsidy and fishery management reforms on the high seas.

Here, we describe new additions that make MEGA a more comprehensive tool for building timetrees of species, pathogens, and gene families using rapid relaxed-clock methods. Methods for estimating divergence times and confidence intervals are implemented to use probability densities for calibration constraints for node-dating and sequence sampling dates for tip-dating analyses. They are supported by new options for tagging sequences with spatiotemporal sampling information, an expanded interactive Node Calibrations Editor, and an extended Tree Explorer to display timetrees. Also added is a Bayesian method for estimating neutral evolutionary probabilities of alleles in a species using multispecies sequence alignments and a machine learning method to test for the autocorrelation of evolutionary rates in phylogenies. The computer memory requirements for the maximum likelihood analysis are reduced significantly through reprogramming, and the graphical user interface has been made more responsive and interactive for very big data sets. These enhancements will improve the user experience, quality of results, and the pace of biological discovery. Natively compiled graphical user interface and command-line versions of MEGA11 are available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS from www.megasoftware.net.

The paper deals with the underlying research concepts related to personalized pre-treatment recommendations for drop-out risk and optimal treatment strategy selection as well as personalized adaptive recommendations during treatment. The development sample consisted of 1234 patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Modem statistical machine learning techniques were used to develop personalized recommendations. Drop-out analyses resulted in seven significant predictors explaining 12.0% of variance. The prediction of optimal treatment strategies resulted in differential prediction models substantially improving effect sizes and reliable improvement rates. The dynamic failure boundary reliably identified patients with a higher risk for no improvement or deterioration and indicated the usage of clinical problem-solving tools in risk areas. The probability to be reliably improved for patients identified as at risk for treatment failure was about half of the probability for other patients (35% vs. 62.15%; chi(2)(df = 1) = 82.77, p < .001). Results related to the computer-based feedback system are discussed with regard to the implication for clinical applications as well as clinical training and future research possibilities.

In this paper, we specifically designed a network architecture for the MS/HS fusion task, called MHF-net, which not only contains clear interpretability, but also reasonably embeds the well studied linear mapping that links the HrHS image to HrMS and LrHS images. In particular, we first construct an MS/HS fusion model which merges the generalization models of low-resolution images and the low-rankness prior knowledge of HrHS image into a concise formulation, and then we build the proposed network by unfolding the proximal gradient algorithm for solving the proposed model. As a result of the careful design for the model and algorithm, all the fundamental modules in MHF-net have clear physical meanings and are thus easily interpretable. This not only greatly facilitates an easy intuitive observation and analysis on what happens inside the network, but also leads to its good generalization capability. Based on the architecture of MHF-net, we further design two deep learning regimes for two general cases in practice: consistent MHF-net and blind MHF-net. The former is suitable in the case that spectral and spatial responses of training and testing data are consistent, just as considered in most of the pervious general supervised MS/HS fusion researches. The latter ensures a good generalization in mismatch cases of spectral and spatial responses in training and testing data, and even across different sensors, which is generally considered to be a challenging issue for general supervised MS/HS fusion methods. Experimental results on simulated and real data substantiate the superiority of our method both visually and quantitatively as compared with state-of-the-art methods along this line of research.

UK Biobank is a powerful resource for studying associations between imaging and non-imaging measures such as lifestyle factors and health outcomes, in part because of the large subject numbers. However, the resulting high statistical power also raises the sensitivity to confound effects, which therefore have to be carefully considered. In this work we describe a set of possible confounds (including non-linear effects and interactions that researchers may wish to consider for their studies using such data). We include descriptions of how we can estimate the confounds, and study the extent to which each of these confounds affects the data, and the spurious correlations that may arise if they are not controlled. Finally, we discuss several issues that future studies should consider when dealing with confounds.	[Alfaro-Almagro, Fidel; McCarthy, Paul; Andersson, Jesper L.

However, an explanation on the physical meaning of a CNN architecture has rarely been studied. In this article, a novel wavelet-driven deep neural network, termed as WaveletKernelNet (WKN), is presented, where a continuous wavelet convolutional (CWConv) layer is designed to replace the first convolutional layer of the standard CNN. This enables the first CWConv layer to discover more meaningful kernels. Furthermore, only the scale parameter and translation parameter are directly learned from raw data at this CWConv layer. This provides a very effective way to obtain a customized kernel bank, specifically tuned for extracting defect-related impact component embedded in the vibration signal. In addition, three experimental studies using data from laboratory environment are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mechanical fault diagnosis. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the WKNs is higher than CNN by more than 10%, which indicate the importance of the designed CWConv layer. Besides, through theoretical analysis and feature map visualization, it is found that the WKNs are interpretable, have fewer parameters, and have the ability to converge faster within the same training epochs.

Emerging metallic systems for additive manufacturing: In-situ alloying and multi-metal processing in laser powder bed fusion	PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Review						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser melting; Processing parameters; In-situ alloying; Multi-material; Machine learning		While significant progress has been made in understanding laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) as well as the fabrication of various materials using this technology, there is still limited adoption in the industry. One of the key obstacles identified is the lack of materials that can truly manufacture functional parts directly with L-PBF. This paper covers the emerging research on in-situ alloying and multi-metal processing. A comprehensive overview of the underlying scientific topics behind them is presented. The current state of research and progress from different perspectives (the materials and L-PBF processing parameters) are reviewed in order to provide a basis for follow-up research and development of these approaches. Defects, especially those associated with these two material processing routes, are also elucidated by discussing the mechanisms of their formation, including the main influencing factors, and the tendency for them to occur. Future research trends and potential topics are illustrated. The final part of this paper summarizes findings from this review and outlines the possibility of in-situ alloying and multi-metal processing using L-PBF.	[Sing, S. L.; Huang, S.; Goh, G. D.; Goh, G.

Development and validation of parsimonious algorithms to classify acute respiratory distress syndrome phenotypes: a secondary analysis of randomised controlled trials	LANCET RESPIRATORY MEDICINE			English	Article							LUNG INJURY; SUBPHENOTYPES	Background Using latent class analysis (LCA) in five randomised controlled trial (RCT) cohorts, two distinct phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been identified: hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory. The phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes and treatment response. The objective of this study was to develop parsimonious models for phenotype identification that could be accurate and feasible to use in the clinical setting. Methods In this retrospective study, three RCT cohorts from the National Lung, Heart, and Blood Institute ARDS Network (ARMA, ALVEOLI, and FACTT) were used as the derivation dataset (n=2022), from which the machine learning and logistic regression classifer models were derived, and a fourth (SAILS; n=715) from the same network was used as the validation test set. LCA-derived phenotypes in all of these cohorts served as the reference standard. Machine-learning algorithms (random forest, bootstrapped aggregating, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) were used to select a maximum of six important classifier variables, which were then used to develop nested logistic regression models. Only cases with complete biomarker data in the derivation dataset were used for variable selection. The best logistic regression models based on parsimony and predictive accuracy were then evaluated in the validation test set. Finally, the models' prognostic validity was tested in two external ARDS clinical trial datasets (START and HARP-2) by assessing mortality at days 28, 60, and 90 and ventilator-free days to day 28. Findings The six most important classifier variables were interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, protein C, soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1, bicarbonate, and vasopressor use. From the nested models, three-variable (IL-8, bicarbonate, and protein C) and four-variable (3-variable plus vasopressor use) models were adjudicated to be the best performing. In the validation test set, both models showed good accuracy (AUC 0.94 [95% CI 0.92-0.95] for the three-variable model and 0.95 [95% CI 0.93-0.96] for the four-variable model) against LCA classifications. As with LCA-derived phenotypes, the hyperinflammatory phenotype as identified by the classifier model was associated with higher mortality at day 90 (87 [39%] of 223 patients vs 112 [23%] of 492 patients; p<0.0001) and fewer ventilator-free days (median 14 days [IQR 0-22] vs 22 days [0-25]; p<0.0001). In the external validation datasets, three-variable models developed in the derivation dataset identified two phenotypes with distinct clinical features and outcomes consistent with previous findings, including differential survival with simvastatin versus placebo in HARP-2 (p=0.023 for survival at 28 days). Interpretation ARDS phenotypes can be accurately identified with parsimonious classifier models using three or four variables. Pending the development of real-time testing for key biomarkers and prospective validation, these models could facilitate identification of ARDS phenotypes to enable their application in clinical trials and practice.

The rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology, pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide some suggestions for future works. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, end users mostly have limited storage capacities and finite processing capabilities, thus how to run compute-intensive applications on resource-constrained users has recently become a natural concern. Mobile edge computing (MEC), a key technology in the emerging fifth generation (5G) network, can optimize mobile resources by hosting compute-intensive applications, process large data before sending to the cloud, provide the cloud-computing capabilities within the radio access network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile users, and offer context-aware services with the help of RAN information. Therefore, MEC enables a wide variety of applications, where the real-time response is strictly required, e.g., driverless vehicles, augmented reality, robotics, and immerse media. Indeed, the paradigm shift from 4G to 5G could become a reality with the advent of new technological concepts. The successful realization of MEC in the 5G network is still in its infancy and demands for constant efforts from both academic and industry communities. In this survey, we first provide a holistic overview of MEC technology and its potential use cases and applications. Then, we outline up-to-date researches on the integration of MEC with the new technologies that will be deployed in 5G and beyond. We also summarize testbeds and experimental evaluations, and open source activities, for edge computing. We further summarize lessons learned from state-of-the-art research works as well as discuss challenges and potential future directions for MEC research.

As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term "Industry 4.0" is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective manufacturing suits. By presenting this review it is also intended to provide a hands-on library of Industry 4.0 to both academics as well as industrial practitioners. The top 100 headings, abstracts and key words (i.e. a total of 619 publications of any kind) for each search term were independently analyzed in order to ensure the reliability of the review process. Note that, this exhaustive literature review provides a concrete definition of Industry 4.0 and defines its six design principles such as interoperability, virtualization, local, real-time talent, service orientation and modularity. It seems that these principles have taken the attention of the scientists to carry out more variety of research on the subject and to develop implementable and appropriate scenarios. A comprehensive taxonomy of Industry 4.0 can also be developed through analyzing the results of this review.

The first module is a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block, which learns to recalibrate channel-wise feature responses by emphasizing informative channels and suppressing less useful ones. The second module is a Part Localization Network (PLN) used to locate distinctive object parts, through which a bank of convolutional filters are learned as discriminative part detectors. Thus, a group of informative parts can be discovered by convolving the feature maps with each part detector. The third module is a Part Classification Network (PCN) that has two streams. The first stream classifies each individual object part into image-level categories. The second stream concatenates part features and global feature into a joint feature for the final classification. In order to learn powerful part features and boost the joint feature capability, we propose a Duplex Focal Loss used for metric learning and part classification, which focuses on training hard examples. We further merge PLN and PCN into a unified network for an end-to-end training process via a simple training technique. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

We exploit the inherent correlation among video frames and incorporate a global co-attention mechanism to further improve the state-of-the-art deep learning based solutions that primarily focus on learning discriminative foreground representations over appearance and motion in short-term temporal segments. The co-attention layers in COSNet provide efficient and competent stages for capturing global correlations and scene context by jointly computing and appending co-attention responses into a joint feature space. COSNet is a unified and end-to-end trainable framework where different co-attention variants can be derived for capturing diverse properties of the learned joint feature space. We train COSNet with pairs (or groups) of video frames, and this naturally augments training data and allows increased learning capacity. During the segmentation stage, the co-attention model encodes useful information by processing multiple reference frames together, which is leveraged to infer the frequently reappearing and salient foreground objects better. Our extensive experiments over three large benchmarks demonstrate that COSNet outperforms the current alternatives by a large margin. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/carrierlxk/COSNet.

In this study, a novel hybrid model with the strength of fractional order derivative is presented with their dynamical features of deep learning, long-short term memory (LSTM) networks, to predict the abrupt stochastic variation of the financial market. Stock market prices are dynamic, highly sensitive, nonlinear and chaotic. There are different techniques for forecast prices in the time-variant domain and due to variability and uncertain behavior in stock prices, traditional methods, such as data mining, statistical approaches, and non-deep neural networks models are not suited for prediction and generalized forecasting stock prices. While autoregressive fractional integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model provides a flexible tool for classes of long-memory models. The advancement of machine learning-based deep non-linear modelling confirms that the hybrid model efficiently extracts profound features and model non-linear functions. LSTM networks are a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) that map sequences of input observations to output observations with capabilities of long-term dependencies. A novel ARFIMA-LSTM hybrid recurrent network is presented in which ARFIMA model-based filters having the linear tendencies better than ARIMA model in the data and passes the residual to the LSTM model that captures nonlinearity in the residual values with the help of exogenous dependent variables. The model not only minimizes the volatility problem but also overcome the over fitting problem of neural networks. The model is evaluated using PSX company data of the stock market based on RMSE, MSE and MAPE along with a comparison of ARIMA, LSTM model and generalized regression radial basis neural network (GRNN) ensemble method independently. The forecasting performance indicates the effectiveness of the proposed AFRIMA-LSTM hybrid model to improve around 80% accuracy on RMSE as compared to traditional forecasting counterparts.

Recently, various deep learning methods, such as convolution neural network (CNN), have shown promising performance in traffic prediction. However, it samples traffic data in regular grids as the input of CNN, thus it destroys the spatial structure of the road network. In this paper, we introduce a graph network and propose an optimized graph convolution recurrent neural network for traffic prediction, in which the spatial information of the road network is represented as a graph. Additionally, distinguishing with most current methods using a simple and empirical spatial graph, the proposed method learns an optimized graph through a data-driven way in the training phase, which reveals the latent relationship among the road segments from the traffic data. Lastly, the proposed method is evaluated on three real-world case studies, and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art traffic prediction methods.

Most existing methods degenerate the applicability of models due to their intractable hyper-parameters triggered by various regularization terms. Moreover, traditional spectral based methods always encounter the expensive time overheads and fail in exploring the explicit clusters from graphs. In this paper, we present a scalable and parameter-free graph fusion framework for multiview clustering, seeking for a joint graph compatible across multiple views in a self-supervised weighting manner. Our formulation coalesces multiple view-wise graphs straightforward and learns the weights as well as the joint graph interactively, which could actively release the model from any weight-related hyper-parameters. Meanwhile, we manipulate the joint graph by a connectivity constraint such that the connected components indicate clusters directly. The designed algorithmis initialization-independent and time-economical which obtains the stable performance and scales well with the data size. Substantial experiments on toy data as well as real datasets are conducted that verify the superiority of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-arts over the clustering performance and time expenditure.

Therefore, flood susceptibility (FS) mapping is indeed necessary to overcome this type of natural hazard phenomena. With this in mind, we evaluated the prediction performance of FS mapping in the Koiya River basin, Eastern India. The present research work was done through preparation of a sophisticated flood inventory map; eight flood conditioning variables were selected based on the topography and hydro-climatological condition, and by applying the novel ensemble approach of hyperpipes (HP) and support vector regression (SVR) machine learning (ML) algorithms. The ensemble approach of HP-SVR was also compared with the stand-alone ML algorithms of HP and SVR. In relative importance of variables, distance to river was the most dominant factor for flood occurrences followed by rainfall, land use land cover (LULC), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The validation and accuracy assessment of FS maps was done through five popular statistical methods. The result of accuracy evaluation showed that the ensemble approach is the most optimal model (AUC = 0.915, sensitivity = 0.932, specificity = 0.902, accuracy = 0.928 and Kappa = 0.835) in FS assessment, followed by HP (AUC = 0.885) and SVR (AUC = 0.871).

The advancement of the global Earth Observation has enabled the development of global LAI products and boosted global Earth system modeling studies. This overview provides a comprehensive analysis of LAI field measurements and remote sensing estimation methods, the product validation methods and product uncertainties, and the application of LAI in global studies. First, the paper clarifies some definitions related to LAI and introduces methods to determine LAI from field measurements and remote sensing observations. After introducing some major global LAI products, progresses made in temporal compositing and prospects for future LAI estimation are analyzed. Subsequently, the overview discusses various LAI product validation schemes, uncertainties in global moderate resolution LAI products, and high resolution reference data. Finally, applications of LAI in global vegetation change, land surface modeling, and agricultural studies are presented. It is recommended that (1) continued efforts are taken to advance LAI estimation algorithms and provide high temporal and spatial resolution products from current and forthcoming missions; (2) further validation studies be conducted to address the inadequacy of current validation studies, especially for underrepresented regions and seasons; and (3) new research frontiers, such as machine learning algorithms, light detection and ranging technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles be pursued to broaden the production and application of LAI.

In this Review, Sorbara and Pamer explore the major bacterial phyla associated with health benefits and the potential of microbiome-based therapeutics, including faecal microbiota transplantation, bacterial consortia, engineered symbiotic bacteria, diet and prebiotics, and microbiome-derived proteins and metabolites. They also discuss the challenges confronting therapeutic development as well as the regulatory hurdles for clinical trials and manufacturing. Symbiotic microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract promote health by decreasing susceptibility to infection and enhancing resistance to a range of diseases. In this Review, we discuss our increasing understanding of the impact of the microbiome on the mammalian host and recent efforts to culture and characterize intestinal symbiotic microorganisms that produce or modify metabolites that impact disease pathology. Manipulation of the intestinal microbiome has great potential to reduce the incidence and/or severity of a wide range of human conditions and diseases, and the biomedical research community now faces the challenge of translating our understanding of the microbiome into beneficial medical therapies. Our increasing understanding of symbiotic microbial species and the application of ecological principles and machine learning are providing exciting opportunities for microbiome-based therapeutics to progress from faecal microbiota transplantation to the administration of precisely defined and clinically validated symbiotic microbial consortia that optimize disease resistance.

MHC molecules come in two main variants: MHC Class I (MHC-I) and MHC Class II (MHC-II). MHC-I predominantly present peptides derived from intracellular proteins, whereas MHC-II predominantly presents peptides from extracellular proteins. In both cases, the binding between MHC and antigenic peptides is the most selective step in the antigen presentation pathway. Therefore, the prediction of peptide binding to MHC is a powerful utility to predict the possible specificity of a T-cell immune response. Commonly MHC binding prediction tools are trained on binding affinity or mass spectrometry-eluted ligands. Recent studies have however demonstrated how the integration of both data types can boost predictive performances. Inspired by this, we here present NetMHCpan-4.1 and NetMHCIIpan-4.0, two web servers created to predict binding between peptides and MHC-I and MHC-II, respectively. Both methods exploit tailored machine learning strategies to integrate different training data types, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and outperforming their competitors. The servers are available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan-4.1/ and http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-4.0/.

It provides better insights of many genetic mutations occurring within a cell associated with cancer. However, thousands of gene expressions measured for each biological sample using microarray pose a great challenge. Many statistical and machine learning methods have been applied to get most relevant genes prior to cancer classification. A two phase hybrid model for cancer classification is being proposed, integrating Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) with improved-Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (iBPSO). This model selects a low dimensional set of prognostic genes to classify biological samples of binary and multi class cancers using NaiveBayes classifier with stratified 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed iBPSO also controls the problem of early convergence to the local optimum of traditional BPSO. The proposed model has been evaluated on 11 benchmark microarray datasets of different cancer types. Experimental results are compared with seven other well known methods, and our model exhibited better results in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes in most cases. In particular, it achieved up to 100% classification accuracy for seven out of eleven datasets with a very small sized prognostic gene subset (up to <1.5%) for all eleven datasets.

It has been predominantly viewed as a unitary domain general system. Here, we examined patterns of FPCN functional connectivity (FC) across multiple conditions of varying cognitive demands, to test for FPCN heterogeneity. We identified two distinct subsystems within the FPCN based on hierarchical clustering and machine learning classification analyses of within FPCN FC patterns. These two FPCN subsystems exhibited distinct patterns of FC with the default network (DN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN). FPCNA exhibited stronger connectivity with the DN than the DAN, whereas FPCNB exhibited the opposite pattern. This twofold FPCN differentiation was observed across four independent datasets, across nine different conditions (rest and eight tasks), at the level of individual-participant data, as well as in meta-analytic coactivation patterns. Notably, the extent of FPCN differentiation varied across conditions, suggesting flexible adaptation to task demands. Finally, we used meta-analytic tools to identify several functional domains associated with the DN and DAN that differentially predict activation in the FPCN subsystems. These findings reveal a flexible and heterogeneous FPCN organization that may in part emerge from separable DN and DAN processing streams. We propose that FPCNA may be preferentially involved in the regulation of introspective processes, whereas FPCNB may be preferentially involved in the regulation of visuospatial perceptual attention.

The Biological Meaning of Radiomic Features	RADIOLOGY			English	Article							CELL LUNG-CANCER; RIF-1 TUMOR-MODEL; MUTATION STATUS; IMAGING PHENOTYPES; SOMATIC MUTATIONS; HETEROGENEITY; MRI; HYPOXIA; BIOMARKERS; SURVIVAL	Radiomic analysis offers a powerful tool for the extraction of clinically relevant information from radiologic imaging. Radiomics can be used to predict patient outcome through automated high-throughput feature extraction, using large training cohorts to elucidate subtle relationships between image characteristics and disease status. However powerful, the data-driven nature of radiomics inherently offers no insight into the biological underpinnings of the observed relationships. Early radiomics work was dominated by analysis of semantic, radiologist-defined features and carried qualitative real-world meaning. Following the rapid developments and popularity of machine learning approaches, the field moved quickly toward high-throughput agnostic analyses, resulting in increasingly large feature sets. This trend took the focus toward an increase in predictive power and further away from a biological understanding of the findings. Such a disconnect between predictor model and biological meaning will inherently limit broad clinical translation. Efforts to reintroduce biological meaning into radiomics are gaining traction in the field with distinct emerging approaches available, including genomic correlates, local microscopic pathologic image textures, and macroscopic histopathologic marker expression. These methods are presented in this review, and their significance is discussed. The authors predict that following the increasing pressure for robust radiomics, biological validation will become a standard practice in the field, thus further cementing the role of the method in clinical decision making.

Dynamics of Gene Expression in Single Root Cells of Arabidopsis thaliana	PLANT CELL			English	Article							HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; SEED-GERMINATION; REGULATORY DNA; MAP; DIVISION; STRESS; ENDOREDUPLICATION; DIVERGENCE; CYTOKININ	Single cell RNA sequencing can yield high-resolution cell-type-specific expression signatures that reveal new cell types and the developmental trajectories of cell lineages. Here, we apply this approach to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root cells to capture gene expression in 3,121 root cells. We analyze these data with Monocle 3, which orders single cell transcriptomes in an unsupervised manner and uses machine learning to reconstruct single cell developmental trajectories along pseudotime. We identify hundreds of genes with cell-type-specific expression, with pseudotime analysis of several cell lineages revealing both known and novel genes that are expressed along a developmental trajectory. We identify transcription factor motifs that are enriched in early and late cells, together with the corresponding candidate transcription factors that likely drive the observed expression patterns. We assess and interpret changes in total RNA expression along developmental trajectories and show that trajectory branch points mark developmental decisions. Finally, by applying heat stress to whole seedlings, we address the longstanding question of possible heterogeneity among cell types in the response to an abiotic stress. Although the response of canonical heat-shock genes dominates expression across cell types, subtle but significant differences in other genes can be detected among cell types. Taken together, our results demonstrate that single cell transcriptomics holds promise for studying plant development and plant physiology with unprecedented resolution.

Numerous experimental studies indicate that alterations and dysregulations in miRNAs are associated with important complex diseases, especially cancers. Predicting potential miRNA-disease association is beneficial not only to explore the pathogenesis of diseases, but also to understand biological processes. In this work, we propose two methods that can effectively predict potential miRNA-disease associations using our reconstructed miRNA and disease similarity networks, which are based on the latest experimental data. We reconstruct a miRNA functional similarity network using the following biological information: the miRNA family information, miRNA cluster information, experimentally valid miRNA-target association and disease-miRNA information. We also reconstruct a disease similarity network using disease functional information and disease semantic information. We present Katz with specific weights and Katz with machine learning, on the comprehensive heterogeneous network. These methods, which achieve corresponding AUC values of 0.897 and 0.919, exhibit performance superior to the existing methods. Comprehensive data networks and reasonable considerations guarantee the high performance of our methods. Contrary to several methods, which cannot work in such situations, the proposed methods also predict associations for diseases without any known related miRNAs.

In particular, with their inherent attributes such as mobility, flexibility, and adaptive altitude, UAVs admit several key potential applications in wireless systems. On the one hand, UAVs can be used as aerial base stations to enhance coverage, capacity, reliability, and energy efficiency of wireless networks. On the other hand, UAVs can operate as flying mobile terminals within a cellular network. Such cellular-connected UAVs can enable several applications ranging from real-time video streaming to item delivery. In this paper, a comprehensive tutorial on the potential benefits and applications of UAVs in wireless communications is presented. Moreover, the important challenges and the fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled wireless networks are thoroughly investigated. In particular, the key UAV challenges such as 3D deployment, performance analysis, channel modeling, and energy efficiency are explored along with representative results. Then, open problems and potential research directions pertaining to UAV communications are introduced. Finally, various analytical frameworks and mathematical tools, such as optimization theory, machine learning, stochastic geometry, transport theory, and game theory are described. The use of such tools for addressing unique UAV problems is also presented. In a nutshell, this tutorial provides key guidelines on how to analyze, optimize, and design UAV-based wireless communication systems.

Using Data Science To Guide Aryl Bromide Substrate Scope Analysis in a Ni/Photoredox-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling with Acetals as Alcohol-Derived Radical Sources	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CHEMISTRY INFORMER LIBRARIES; METALLAPHOTOREDOX CATALYSIS; METHYLATION; HALIDES; CHEMOINFORMATICS; ACTIVATION; FRAGMENTS; ARYLATION; CLEAVAGE; STRATEGY	Ni/photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful platform for C(sp(2))-C(sp(3)) bond formation. While many of these methods typically employ aryl bromides as the C(sp(2)) coupling partner, a variety of aliphatic radical sources have been investigated. In principle, these reactions enable access to the same product scaffolds, but it can be hard to discern which method to employ because nonstandardized sets of aryl bromides are used in scope evaluation. Herein, we report a Ni/photoredox-catalyzed (deutero)methylation and alkylation of aryl halides where benzaldehyde di(alkyl) acetals serve as alcohol-derived radical sources. Reaction development, mechanistic studies, and late-stage derivatization of a biologically relevant aryl chloride, fenolibrate, are presented. Then, we describe the integration of data science techniques, including DFT featurization, dimensionality reduction, and hierarchical clustering, to delineate a diverse and succinct collection of aryl bromides that is representative of the chemical space of the substrate class. By superimposing scope examples from published Ni/photoredox methods on this same chemical space, we identify areas of sparse coverage and high versus low average yields, enabling comparisons between prior art and this new method. Additionally, we demonstrate that the systematically selected scope of aryl bromides can be used to quantify population-wide reactivity trends and reveal sources of possible functional group incompatibility with supervised machine learning.

Multiplexed detection and quantification of human antibody response to COVID-19 infection using a plasmon enhanced biosensor platform	BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS			English	Article						COVID-19; Antibody; Biosensor; Plasmonic; Quantitative; Multiplex		The 2019 SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has illustrated the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tests. In this work, a multiplexed grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) biosensor platform was used to rapidly and accurately measure antibodies against COVID-19 in human blood serum and dried blood spot samples. The GC-FP platform measures antibody-antigen binding interactions for multiple targets in a single sample, and has 100% selectivity and sensitivity (n = 23) when measuring serum IgG levels against three COVID-19 antigens (spike S1, spike S1S2, and the nucleocapsid protein). The GC-FP platform yielded a quantitative, linear response for serum samples diluted to as low as 1:1600 dilution. Test results were highly correlated with two commercial COVID-19 antibody tests, including an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay. To demonstrate test efficacy with other sample matrices, dried blood spot samples (n = 63) were obtained and evaluated with GC-FP, yielding 100% selectivity and 86.7% sensitivity for diagnosing prior COVID-19 infection. The test was also evaluated for detection of multiple immunoglobulin isotypes, with successful detection of IgM, IgG and IgA antibody-antigen interactions. Last, a machine learning approach was developed to accurately score patient samples for prior COVID-19 infection, using antibody binding data for all three COVID-19 antigens used in the test.

This study introduces a global gridded monthly reconstruction of runoff covering the period from 1902 to 2014. In situ streamflow observations are used to train a machine learning algorithm that predicts monthly runoff rates based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis. The accuracy of this reconstruction is assessed with cross-validation and compared with an independent set of discharge observations for large river basins. The presented dataset agrees on average better with the streamflow observations than an ensemble of 13 state-of-the art global hydrological model runoff simulations. We estimate a global long-term mean runoff of 38 452 km(3)yr(-1) in agreement with previous assessments. The temporal coverage of the reconstruction offers an unprecedented view on large-scale features of runoff variability in regions with limited data coverage, making it an ideal candidate for large-scale hydro-climatic process studies, water resource assessments, and evaluating and refining existing hydrological models. The paper closes with example applications fostering the understanding of global freshwater dynamics, interannual variability, drought propagation and the response of runoff to atmospheric teleconnections.

This combination could result in ANFIS-ICA and ANFIS-FA models, which were applied to flood spatial modelling and its mapping in the Haraz watershed in Northern Province of Mazandaran, Iran. Ten influential factors including slope angle, elevation, stream power index (SPI), curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, rainfall, land use, stream density, and the distance to river were selected for flood modelling. The validity of the models was assessed using statistical error-indices (RMSE and MSE), statistical tests (Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests), and the area under the curve (AUC) of success. The prediction accuracy of the models was compared to some new state-of-theart sophisticated machine learning techniques that had previously been successfully tested in the study area. The results confirmed the goodness of fit and appropriate prediction accuracy of the two ensemble models. However, the ANFIS-ICA model (AUC = 0.947) had a better performance in comparison to the Bagging-LMT (AUC = 0.940), BLR (AUC = 0.936), LMT (AUC = 0.934), ANFIS-FA (AUC = 0.917), LR (AUC = 0.885) and RF (AUC = 0.806) models. Therefore, the ANFIS-ICA model can be introduced as a promising method for the sustainable management of flood-prone areas.

In this contribution, the most recent advances in NPCs for AWE were systematically reviewed, emphasizing the application of in situ/operando experimental methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in their understanding and development. First, we briefly introduced the fundamentals of the anode and cathode reaction for AWE, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Next, the most popular in situ/operando approaches for characterizing AWE catalysts, including hard and soft XAS, ambient-pressure XPS, liquid and identical location TEM, electrochemical mass spectrometry, and Raman spectroscopy were thoroughly summarized. Subsequently, we carefully discussed the principles, computational methods, applications, and combinations of DFT with machine learning for modeling NPCs and predicting the alkaline OER and HER. With the improved understanding of the structure-property-performance relationship of NPCs for AWE, we proceeded to overview their current development, summarising state-of-the-art design strategies to boost their activity. In addition, advances in various extensively investigated NPCs for AWE were evaluated. By conveying these methods, progress, insights, and perspectives, this review will contribute to a better understanding and rational development of non-precious AWE electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.

However, the optimization of resource allocation is typically formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is non-convex and NP-hard by nature. Usually, solving such a problem is challenging and requires specific methods due to the major shortcomings of the traditional approaches, such as exponential computation complexity of global optimization, no performance optimality guarantee of heuristic schemes, and large training time and generating a standard dataset of machine learning based approaches. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) has recently gained the attention of the research community as an efficient method to solve a variety of optimization problems. As an alternative to the existing methods, our main goal in this article is to study the applicability of WOA to solve resource allocation problems in wireless networks. First, we present the fundamental backgrounds and the binary version of the WOA as well as introducing a penalty method to handle optimization constraints. Then, we demonstrate three examples of WOA to resource allocation in wireless networks, including power allocation for energy-and-spectral efficiency tradeoff in wireless interference networks, power allocation for secure throughput maximization, and mobile edge computation offloading. Lastly, we present the adoption ofWOA to solve a variety of potential resource allocation problems in 5G wireless networks and beyond.

The exponentially increasing anthropogenic activities on the planet have aggregated the climate change and consequently increased the frequency and severity of these natural hazard-related disasters, and consequential damages in cities. The digital technological advancements, such as monitoring systems based on fusion of sensors and machine learning, in early detection, warning and disaster response systems are being implemented as part of the disaster management practice in many countries and presented useful results. Along with these promising technologies, crowdsourced social media disaster big data analytics has also started to be utilized. This study aims to form an understanding of how social media analytics can be utilized to assist government authorities in estimating the damages linked to natural hazard-related disaster impacts on urban centers in the age of climate change. To this end, this study analyzes crowdsourced disaster big data from Twitter users in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories.

J	Liu, KL; Shang, YL; Ouyang, Q; Widanage, WD				Liu, Kailong; Shang, Yunlong; Ouyang, Quan; Widanage, Widanalage Dhammika			A Data-Driven Approach With Uncertainty Quantification for Predicting Future Capacities and Remaining Useful Life of Lithium-ion Battery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Uncertainty; Degradation; Lithium-ion batteries; Reliability; Ground penetrating radar; Predictive models; Electric vehicles (EVs); data-driven approach; lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries; remaining useful life (RUL); uncertainty management	GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION; HEALTH ESTIMATION; STATE; MODEL; DIAGNOSIS	Predicting future capacities and remaining useful life (RUL) with uncertainty quantification is a key but challenging issue in the applications of battery health diagnosis and management. This article applies advanced machine-learning techniques to achieve effective future capacities and RUL prediction for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with reliable uncertainty management. To be specific, after using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, the original battery capacity data is decomposed into some intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) submodel is applied to estimate the residual while the Gaussian process regression (GPR) submodel is utilized to fit the IMFs with the uncertainty level. Consequently, both the long-term dependence of capacity and uncertainty quantification caused by the capacity regenerations can be captured directly and simultaneously. Experimental aging data from different batteries are deployed to evaluate the performance of proposed LSTM+GPR model in comparison with the solo GPR, solo LSTM, GPR+EMD, and LSTM+EMD models. Illustrative results demonstrate the combined LSTM+GPR model outperforms other counterparts and is capable of achieving accurate results for both 1-step and multistep ahead capacity predictions. Even predicting the RUL at the early battery cycle stage, the proposed data-driven approach still presents good adaptability and reliable uncertainty quantification for battery health diagnosis.

Ranking microbiome variance in inflammatory bowel disease: a large longitudinal intercontinental study	GUT			English	Article							GUT MICROBIOME; DIET; HEALTH	Objective The microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but the relative contribution of different lifestyle and environmental factors to the compositional variability of the gut microbiota is unclear. Design Here, we rank the size effect of disease activity, medications, diet and geographic location of the faecal microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n=303), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 228) and controls (n=161), followed longitudinally (at three time points with 16 weeks intervals). Results Reduced microbiota diversity but increased variability was confirmed in CD and UC compared with controls. Significant compositional differences between diseases, particularly CD, and controls were evident. Longitudinal analyses revealed reduced temporal microbiota stability in IBD, particularly in patients with changes in disease activity. Machine learning separated disease from controls, and active from inactive disease, when consecutive time points were modelled. Geographic location accounted for most of the microbiota variance, second to the presence or absence of CD, followed by history of surgical resection, alcohol consumption and UC diagnosis, medications and diet with most (90.3%) of the compositional variance stochastic or unexplained. Conclusion The popular concept of precision medicine and rational design of any therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota will have to contend not only with the heterogeneity of the host response, but also with widely differing lifestyles and with much variance still unaccounted for.

Detection of ORIs' distribution in genome scale is one of key steps to in-depth understanding their regulation mechanisms. In this study, we presented a novel machine learning-based approach called Stack-ORI encompassing 10 cell-specific prediction models for identifying ORIs from four different eukaryotic species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana). For each cell-specific model, we employed 12 feature encoding schemes that cover nucleic acid composition, position-specific and physicochemical properties information. The optimal feature set was identified from each encoding individually and developed their respective baseline models using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier. Subsequently, the predicted scores of 12 baseline models are integrated as a novel feature vector to train XGBoost and develop the final model. Extensive experimental results show that Stack-ORI achieves significantly better performance as compared with their baseline models on both training and independent datasets. Interestingly, Stack-ORI consistently outperforms existing predictor in all cell-specific models, not only on training but also on independent test. Moreover, our novel approach provides necessary interpretations that help understanding model success by leveraging the powerful SHapley Additive exPlanation algorithm, thus underlining the most important feature encoding schemes significant for predicting cell-specific ORIs.

While a large variety of bounds are available for average errors between empirical and population statistics of eigenvectors, few results are tight for entrywise analyses, which are critical for a number of problems such as community detection. This paper investigates entrywise behaviors of eigenvectors for a large class of random matrices whose expectations are low-rank, which helps settle the conjecture in Abbe, Bandeira and Hall (2014) that the spectral algorithm achieves exact recovery in the stochastic block model without any trimming or cleaning steps. The key is a first-order approximation of eigenvectors under the l(infinity) norm: u(k) approximate to Au-k*/lambda(k)*, where {u(k)} and {u(k)*} are eigenvectors of a random matrix A and its expectation EA, respectively. The fact that the approximation is both tight and linear in A facilitates sharp comparisons between u(k) and u(k)*. In particular, it allows for comparing the signs of u(k) and u(k)* even if parallel to u(k) - u(k)*parallel to(infinity) is large. The results are further extended to perturbations of eigenspaces, yielding new l(infinity)-type bounds for synchronization (Z(2)-spiked Wigner model) and noisy matrix completion.

Mapping soil organic matter contents at field level with Cubist, Random Forest and kriging	GEODERMA			English	Article						Denmark; Mapping; Models; Vegetation indices; Regression-kriging	CARBON STOCKS; TERRAIN ATTRIBUTES; SPATIAL PREDICTION; SCALE; TEMPERATURE; AREAS; INDEX	The soil organic matter (SOM) content is strongly related to soil fertility and greenhouse gas emissions. Knowledge of the soil SOM content is therefore necessary for efficient and sustainable management practices. In this study, we compare the performance of five machine learning techniques for the prediction of SOM contents using remote sensing, proximal soil sensors and topographic data as environmental predictor. The methods used were kriging, Cubist, Random Forest and regression-kriging (Cubist- kriging and Random Forest kriging). 285 soil samples were collected from a 10 ha field in Denmark. 75% of the data were used for training and 25% for validation. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), DVI (Difference Vegetation Index) and SAW (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) were derived from Sentinel 2 images with 10 m resolution as auxiliary variables. Topographic variables were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) with 1.6 m resolution. The performance of the methods was compared based on the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that kriging achieved the best performance, followed by regression-kriging. The models using only Cubist and Random forest had the poorest performance. The results, therefore, demonstrate that kriging can predict SOM contents without the need of auxiliary variables for fields with high sampling densities.

However, rigorous determination of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is very difficult owing to its continuous evolution with over 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) variants in many subtypes. We employ an algebraic topology-based machine learning model to quantitatively evaluate the binding free energy changes of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor following mutations. We reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus becomes more infectious. Three out of six SARS-CoV-2 subtypes have become slightly more infectious, while the other three subtypes have significantly strengthened their infectivity. We also find that SARS-CoV-2 is slightly more infectious than SARS-CoV according to computed S protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding free energy changes. Based on a systematic evaluation of all possible 3686 future mutations on the S protein receptor-binding domain, we show that most likely future mutations will make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious. Combining sequence alignment, probability analysis, and binding free energy calculation, we predict that a few residues on the receptor-binding motif, i.e., 452, 489, 500, 501, and 505, have high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains.

However, the obstacles for implementation of AI/ML in daily clinical practice are numerous, especially regarding the regulation of these technologies. Therefore, we provide an insight into the currently available AI/ML-based medical devices and algorithms that have been approved by the US Food & Drugs Administration (FDA). We aimed to raise awareness of the importance of regulatory bodies, clearly stating whether a medical device is AI/ML based or not. Cross-checking and validating all approvals, we identified 64 AI/ML based, FDA approved medical devices and algorithms. Out of those, only 29 (45%) mentioned any AI/ML-related expressions in the official FDA announcement. The majority (85.9%) was approved by the FDA with a 510(k) clearance, while 8 (12.5%) received de novo pathway clearance and one (1.6%) premarket approval (PMA) clearance.

J	Guo, WC; Wu, CJ; Ding, ZS; Zhou, QZ				Guo, Weicheng; Wu, Chongjun; Ding, Zishan; Zhou, Qinzhi			Prediction of surface roughness based on a hybrid feature selection method and long short-term memory network in grinding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Grinding; Surface roughness; Feature selection; mRMR; AHP; LSTM	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WHEEL WEAR; SPECTRUM	Ground surface roughness is regarded as one of the most crucial indicators of machining quality and is hard to be predicted due to the random distribution of abrasive grits and sophisticated grinding mechanism. In order to estimate surface roughness accurately in grinding process and provide feasible monitoring scheme for practical manufacturing application, a novel prediction system of surface roughness is presented in this article, including the processing of grinding signals, selection of feature combination, and development of prediction model. Grinding force, vibration, and acoustic emission signals are collected during the grinding of C-250 maraging steel. Numerous features in time domain and frequency domain are extracted from original and decomposed signals. A hybrid feature selection approach is proposed to select features based on their relevance to surface roughness as well as hardware and time costs. A sequential deep learning framework, long short-term memory (LSTM) network, is employed to predict ground surface roughness. The results have shown that the LSTM model achieves excellent prediction performance with a feature combination of grinding force and acoustic emission. After considering the hardware and time costs, features in acceleration signal replace those in grinding force and acoustic emission signals with slight loss of prediction performance and significant reduction of costs, which proves the practicability and feasibility of proposed prediction system.

Our algorithm is very robust, placing no requirements on the problem data such as positive definiteness of the objective function or linear independence of the constraint functions. It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used. OSQP has already shown a large impact with tens of thousands of users both in academia and in large corporations.

First, the multiscale principal component analysis was utilized to obtain clean EEG signals. Second, denoised data were sequentially arranged to form a square matrix of different orders (e.g.,10, 13, 16, and 20) and determinant was computed for each order matrix. Finally, the extracted matrix determinant features were provided to several machine learning and neural network classification models for classification. All experiments were carried out using a 10-fold cross-validation approach on three publicly accessible data sets: 1) data set IV-a; 2) data set IV-b; and 3) data set V of BCI competition III. Also, this study designs a computerized automatic detection of motor and mental imagery graphical user interface that can assist physicians/experts to efficiently analyses motor and mental imagery data. The experimental results reveal that the highest average classification accuracy of 99.55% (for data set IV-a), 99.52% (for data set IV-b), and 91.80% (for data set V) was obtained for motor and mental imagery, respectively, with 20-order matrix determinant using a feedforward neural network classifier. The experimental results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust biomarker with the least computational complexity for the development of automated brain-computer interfaces.

With the emergence of programmable networking terminals, the need to protect the networks has become mandatory. Software-defined networks (SDNs) provide programmable switches, thereby isolating the data plane from the control plane. Many security algorithms have been proposed to protect the network; however, they have failed to protect SDNs from attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), jamming, and man-in-the-middle attacks. In this article, we only address the DDoS attack that prevails in SDNs. Isolation of the control plane from the data plane increases the probability of an attack on the data plane. Therefore, a framework that can handle the dynamic traffic and can protect the network from DDoS attacks is required. Our proposed whale optimization algorithm-based clustering for DDoS detection (WOA-DD) avoids the DDoS attacks using a metaheuristic approach by clustering the attack requests. We evaluated this algorithm for robustness in comparison with several existing solutions and found it to be safe under several conditions. The proposed attack request clustering is explored to check its feasibility with various machine learning approaches and found to be stable with the prevailing mechanisms. Analysis of the algorithm under varied conditions reveals that WOA-DD is robust, stable, and efficient against DDoS attacks.

In the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), many landslides deform distinctly and in steps from April to September each year under the influence of seasonal rainfall and periodic fluctuation in reservoir water level. The sliding becomes more uniform again from October to April. This landslide deformation pattern leads to accumulated displacement versus time showing a step-wise curve. Most of the existing predictive models express static relationships only. However, the evolution of a landslide is a complex nonlinear dynamic process. This paper proposes a dynamic model to predict landslide displacement, based on time series analysis and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The accumulated displacement was decomposed into a trend term and a periodic term in the time series analysis. A cubic polynomial function was selected to predict the trend displacement. By analyzing the relationships between landslide deformation, rainfall, and reservoir water level, a LSTM model was used to predict the periodic displacement. The LSTM approach was found to properly model the dynamic characteristics of landslides than static models, and make full use of the historical information. The performance of the model was validated with the observations of two step-wise landslides in the TGRA, the Baishuihe landslide and Bazimen landslide. The application of the model to those two landslides demonstrates that the LSTM model provides a good representation of the measured displacements and gives a more reliable prediction of landslide displacement than the static support vector machine (SVM) model. It is concluded that the proposed model can be used to effectively predict the displacement of step-wise landslides in the TGRA.

However, most deep learning-based methods detect structural damage at the image level and grid-cell level. To provide pixel-level detection of multiple damages, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)-based multiple damages detection method for concrete structure is proposed. To realize this method, a database of 2,750 images (with 504 x 376 pixels) including crack, spalling, efflorescence, and hole images in concrete structure is built, and the four damages included in those images are labeled manually. Then, the architecture of the FCN is modified, trained, validated, and tested using this database. A strategy of model-based transfer learning is used to initialize the parameters of the FCN during the training process. The results show 98.61% pixel accuracy (PA), 91.59% mean pixel accuracy (MPA), 84.53% mean intersection over union (MIoU), and 97.34% frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU). Subsequently, the robustness and adaptability of the trained FCN model is tested and the damage is extracted, where damage areas are provided according to a calibrated relation between the ratio (the pixel area and true area of the detected object) and the distance from the smartphone to the concrete surface using a laser range finder. A comparative study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed FCN-based approach using a SegNet-based method. The results show that the proposed method substantiates quite better performance and can indeed detect multiple concrete damages at the pixel level in realistic situations.

To classify the hyperspectral images (HSIs), existing CNN-based approaches commonly adopt the architecture using single or several fixed spatial windows as inputs. This kind of architecture may lose contextual information or incorporate heterogeneous information due to the neglect of various land-cover distributions in HSIs. To deal with this problem, a novel attention multibranch CNN method based on adaptive region search (RS-AMCNN) is proposed for HSI classification. In RS-AMCNN, sizes and locations of spatial windows are searched in the nonlocal candidate region adaptively according to sample-specific distribution. These flexible spatial windows are input into several branches of RS-AMCNN. In each branch, convolutional long short-term memories (ConvLSTMs) are merged into CNN from shallow to deep layers, which not only extracts joint spatial-spectral features, but also exploits complementary information among different layers. Then, a branch attention mechanism is devised to emphasize more discriminative branches and suppress less useful ones. It forces RS-AMCNN to extract multiscale and multicontextual attention features for classification. Finally, RS-AMCNN is optimized end-to-end by combining the losses from the ramose classifiers of different branches and the main classifier. Experiments carried on several benchmark HSI data sets demonstrate that RS-AMCNN provides promising classification performance, especially in edge preservation and region uniformity.

In some regions the frequency of DNA recombination is relatively higher, while in other regions the frequency is lower: the former is usually called "recombination hotspot", while the latter the "recombination coldspot". Information of the hot and cold spots may provide important clues for understanding the mechanism of genome revolution. Therefore, it is important to accurately predict these spots. In this study, we rebuilt the benchmark dataset by unifying its samples with a same length (131 bp). Based on such a foundation and using SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier, a new predictor called "iRSpot-Pse6NC" was developed by incorporating the key hexamer features into the general PseKNC (Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition) via the binomial distribution approach. It has been observed via rigorous cross-validations that the proposed predictor is superior to its counterparts in overall accuracy, stability, sensitivity and specificity. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, the web-server for iRSpot-Pse6NC has been established at http://lin-group.cn/server/iRSpot-Pse6NC, by which users can easily obtain their desired result without the need to go through the detailed mathematical equations involved.

Although it is well known that data distribution plays a crucial role in learning and inference models, considerably less attention has been paid to data imbalance in visual tracking. For the deep regression trackers that directly learn a dense mapping from input images of target objects to soft response maps, we identify their performance is limited by the extremely imbalanced pixel-to-pixel differences when computing regression loss. This prevents existing end-to-end learnable deep regression trackers from performing as well as discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) trackers. For the deep classification trackers that draw positive and negative samples to learn discriminative classifiers, there exists heavy class imbalance due to a limited number of positive samples when compared to the number of negative samples. To balance training data, we propose a novel shrinkage loss to penalize the importance of easy training data mostly coming from the background, which facilitates both deep regression and classification trackers to better distinguish target objects from the background. We extensively validate the proposed shrinkage loss function on six benchmark datasets, including the OTB-2013, OTB-2015, UAV-123, VOT-2016, VOT-2018 and LaSOT. Equipped with our shrinkage loss, the proposed one-stage deep regression tracker achieves favorable results against state-of-the-art methods, especially in comparison with DCFs trackers. Meanwhile, our shrinkage loss generalizes well to deep classification trackers. When replacing the original binary cross entropy loss with our shrinkage loss, three representative baseline trackers achieve large performance gains, even setting new state-of-the-art results.

Advertising Content and Consumer Engagement on Social Media: Evidence from Facebook	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						consumer engagement; social media; advertising content; content engineering; marketing communication; machine learning; natural language processing; selection; Facebook; EdgeRank; News Feed algorithm	INFORMATION-CONTENT; MODELS	We describe the effect of social media advertising content on customer engagement using data from Facebook. We content-code 106,316 Facebook messages across 782 companies, using a combination of Amazon Mechanical Turk and natural language processing algorithms. We use this data set to study the association of various kinds of social media marketing content with user engagement-defined as Likes, comments, shares, and click-throughs-with the messages. We find that inclusion of widely used content related to brand personality-like humor and emotion-is associated with higher levels of consumer engagement (Likes, comments, shares) with a message. We find that directly informative content-like mentions of price and deals-is associated with lower levels of engagement when included in messages in isolation, but higher engagement levels when provided in combination with brand personality-related attributes. Also, certain directly informative content, such as deals and promotions, drive consumers' path to conversion (click-throughs). These results persist after incorporating corrections for the nonrandom targeting of Facebook's EdgeRank (News Feed) algorithm and so reflect more closely user reaction to content than Facebook's behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that there are benefits to content engineering that combines informative characteristics that help in obtaining immediate leads (via improved click-throughs) with brand personality-related content that helps in maintaining future reach and branding on the social media site (via improved engagement). These results inform content design strategies. Separately, the methodologywe apply to content-code text is useful for future studies utilizing unstructured data such as advertising content or product reviews.

Such studies often use large datasets, which may incorporate structured and unstructured data, from various platforms. The questions that such papers address, in turn, may attempt to use methods from computational science like sentiment mining, text mining, network science and image analytics to derive insights. However, there is often a weak theoretical contribution in many of these studies. We point out the need for such studies to contribute back to the IS discipline, whereby findings can explain more about the phenomenon surrounding the interaction of people with technology artefacts and the ecosystem within which these contextual usage is situated. Our opinion paper attempts to address this gap and provide insights on the methodological adaptations required in "big data studies" to be converted into "IS research" and contribute to theory building in information systems.

This method, called temporal segment network (TSN), aims to model long-range temporal structure with a new segment-based sampling and aggregation scheme. This unique design enables the TSN framework to efficiently learn action models by using the whole video. The learned models could be easily deployed for action recognition in both trimmed and untrimmed videos with simple average pooling and multi-scale temporal window integration, respectively. We also study a series of good practices for the implementation of the TSN framework given limited training samples. Our approach obtains the state-the-of-art performance on five challenging action recognition benchmarks: HMDB51 (71.0 percent), UCF101 (94.9 percent), THUMOS14 (80.1 percent), ActivityNet v1.2 (89.6 percent), and Kinetics400 (75.7 percent). In addition, using the proposed RGB difference as a simple motion representation, our method can still achieve competitive accuracy on UCF101 (91.0 percent) while running at 340 FPS. Furthermore, based on the proposed TSN framework, we won the video classification track at the ActivityNet challenge 2016 among 24 teams.

To extract edges at dramatically different scales, we propose a bi-directional cascade network (BDCN) architecture, where an individual layer is supervised by labeled edges at its specific scale, rather than directly applying the same supervision to different layers. Furthermore, to enrich multi-scale representations learned by each layer of BDCN, we introduce a scale enhancement module (SEM), which utilizes dilated convolution to generate multi-scale features, instead of using deeper CNNs. These new approaches encourage the learning of multi-scale representations in different layers and detect edges that are well delineated by their scales. Learning scale dedicated layers also results in a compact network with a fraction of parameters. We evaluate our method on three datasets, i.e., BSDS500, NYUDv2, and Multicue, and achieve ODS F-measure of 0.832, 2.7 percent higher than current state-of-the-art on the BSDS500 dataset. We also applied our edge detection result to other vision tasks. Experimental results show that, our method further boosts the performance of image segmentation, optical flow estimation, and object proposal generation.

J	Li, T; Liu, AF; Xiong, NN; Zhang, SB; Wang, T				Li, Ting; Liu, Anfeng; Xiong, Neal N.; Zhang, Shaobo; Wang, Tian			A trustworthiness-based vehicular recruitment scheme for information collections in Distributed Networked Systems	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Trustworthiness; Vehicle recruitment; Coverage; Security; Information quality; Distributed Networked Systems	SELECTION	Because of high mobility, large number of vehicles are utilized to achieve timely and quality-based information in the smart Internet of Things, which has formulated into a dynamic Distributed Networked Systems (DNS). However, designing a vehicular recruitment scheme to enhance a security-based DNS is challenging since it is hard to judge trustworthiness values of vehicular sensors. Therefore, in this paper, a novel vehicular trust evaluation scheme is proposed to analyze and supervise the data collected by vehicular sensors with a trust and low-cost style. To obtain vehicular trusts, the proposed scheme that considers time factor and gap between sensed data and real data is designed to calculate trustworthiness of vehicles. Moreover, sensing data in the vehicle sparse regions has more contributions because of its rareness. Thus, to inspire vehicles to sense data in the vehicle sparse regions, a trustworthiness-based gradient pricing method is designed to pay rewards for the vehicular sensors. Finally, with real vehicular GPS datasets, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve accuracy rate of data sensing by 37.72% and can improve data quality by 76.95%. By incentive pricing method, coverage ratio of data sensing is improved by 13.1%. In general, performances of the proposed scheme can be improved by 19. 39% to 22.32% approximately.

The only database that currently provides soil salinity data with global coverage is the Harmonized World Soil Database, but it has several limitations when it comes to soil salinity assessment. Therefore, a new assessment is required. We hypothesized that combining soil properties maps with thermal infrared imagery and a large set of field observations within a machine learning framework will yield a global soil salinity map. The thermal infrared imagery acts as a dynamic variable and allows us to characterize the soil salinity change. For this purpose we used Google Earth Engine computational environment. The random forest classifier was trained using 7 soil properties maps, thermal infrared imagery and the ECe point data from the WoSIS database. In total, six maps were produced for 1986, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2016. The validation accuracy of the resulting maps was in the range of 67-70%. The total area of salt affected lands by our assessment is around 1 billion hectares, with a clear increasing trend. Comparison with 3 studies investigating local trends of soil salinity change showed that our assessment was in correspondence with 2 of these studies. The global map of soil salinity change between 1986 and 2016 was produced to characterize the spatial distribution of the change. We conclude that combining soil properties maps and thermal infrared imagery allows mapping of soil salinity development in space and time on a global scale.

However, hydrogen does not exist in nature as a separate element but only in compound forms. Hydrogen is produced through a process that dissociates it from its compounds. Several methods are used for hydrogen production, which first of all differ in the energy used in this process. Investigating the viability and exact applicability of a method in a specific context requires accurate knowledge of the parameters involved in the method and the interaction between these parameters. This can be done using top-down models relying on complex mathematically driven equations. However, with the raise of computational intelligence (CI) and machine learning techniques, researchers in hydrology have increasingly been using these methods for this complex task and report promising results. The contribution of this study is to investigate the state of the art CI methods employed in hydrogen production, and to identify the CI method(s) that perform better in the prediction, assessment and optimization tasks related to different types of Hydrogen production methods. The resulting analysis provides in-depth insight into the different hydrogen production methods, modeling technique and the obtained results from various scenarios, integrating them within the framework of a common discussion and evaluation paper. The identified methods were benchmarked by a qualitative analysis of the accuracy of CI in modeling hydrogen production, providing extensive overview of its usage to empower renewable energy utilization.

Big data analytics and artificial intelligence pathway to operational performance under the effects of entrepreneurial orientation and environmental dynamism: A study of manufacturing organisations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Big data analytics; Artificial intelligence; Entrepreneurial orientation; Operational performance; Supply chain management; PLS SEM	SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY 4.0 TECHNOLOGIES; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW; FIRM PERFORMANCE; PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS; MARKET ORIENTATION; MEDIATING ROLE; BUSINESS PERFORMANCE; USER ACCEPTANCE; DATA SCIENCE	The importance of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning has been at the forefront of research for operations and supply chain management. Literature has reported the influence of big data analytics for improved operational performance, but there has been a paucity of research regarding the role of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on the adoption of big data analytics. To address this gap, we draw on the dynamic capabilities view of firms and on contingency theory to develop and test a model that describes the role of EO on the adoption of big data analytics powered by artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and operational performance (OP). We tested our research hypotheses using a survey of 256 responses gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire from manufacturing firms in India with the help of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). The results from our analysis indicate that EO enables an organisation to exploit and further explore the BDA-AI capabilities to achieve superior OP. Further, our results provide empirical evidence based on data analysis that EO is strongly associated with higher order capabilities (such as BDA-AI) and OP under differential effects of environmental dynamism (ED). These findings extend the dynamic capability view and contingency theory to create better understanding of dynamic capabilities of the organisation while also providing theoretically grounded guidance to the managers to align their EO with their technological capabilities within their firms.

In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.

Characterizing Environmental Surveillance Sites in Nigeria and Their Sensitivity to Detect Poliovirus and Other Enteroviruses	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						environmental; eradication; poliovirus; sewage; surveillance	ERADICATION; PROGRESS	Background Environmental surveillance (ES) for poliovirus is increasingly important for polio eradication, often detecting circulating virus before paralytic cases are reported. The sensitivity of ES depends on appropriate selection of sampling sites, which is difficult in low-income countries with informal sewage networks. Methods We measured ES site and sample characteristics in Nigeria during June 2018-May 2019, including sewage physicochemical properties, using a water-quality probe, flow volume, catchment population, and local facilities such as hospitals, schools, and transit hubs. We used mixed-effects logistic regression and machine learning (random forests) to investigate their association with enterovirus isolation (poliovirus and nonpolio enteroviruses) as an indicator of surveillance sensitivity. Results Four quarterly visits were made to 78 ES sites in 21 states of Nigeria, and ES site characteristic data were matched to 1345 samples with an average enterovirus prevalence among sites of 68% (range, 9%-100%). A larger estimated catchment population, high total dissolved solids, and higher pH were associated with enterovirus detection. A random forests model predicted "good" sites (enterovirus prevalence >70%) from measured site characteristics with out-of-sample sensitivity and specificity of 75%. Conclusions Simple measurement of sewage properties and catchment population estimation could improve ES site selection and increase surveillance sensitivity. Easily measured environmental surveillance site characteristics, including sewage properties recorded with a water-quality probe, predict site sensitivity to detect poliovirus and other enteroviruses. Data collection during site selection could identify better sites and improve the sensitivity of global poliovirus surveillance.

Francesca			Different climate sensitivity of particulate and mineral-associated soil organic matter	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							CARBON LOSS; STABILIZATION; EUROPE; STOICHIOMETRY; DECOMPOSITION; PERSISTENCE; EFFICIENCY; RELEVANCE; TRANSPORT; INCREASE	Soil carbon sequestration is seen as an effective means to draw down atmospheric CO2, but at the same time warming may accelerate the loss of extant soil carbon, so an accurate estimation of soil carbon stocks and their vulnerability to climate change is required. Here we demonstrate how separating soil carbon into particulate and mineral-associated organic matter (POM and MAOM, respectively) aids in the understanding of its vulnerability to climate change and identification of carbon sequestration strategies. By coupling European-wide databases with soil organic matter physical fractionation, we assessed the current geographical distribution of mineral topsoil carbon in POM and MAOM by land cover using a machine-learning approach. Further, using observed climate relationships, we projected the vulnerability of carbon in POM and MAOM to future climate change. Arable and coniferous forest soils contain the largest and most vulnerable carbon stocks when cumulated at the European scale. Although we show a lower carbon loss from mineral topsoils with climate change (2.5 +/- 1.2 PgC by 2080) than those in some previous predictions, we urge the implementation of coniferous forest management practices that increase plant inputs to soils to offset POM losses, and the adoption of best management practices to avert the loss of and to build up both POM and MAOM in arable soils.

Effective in feature selection as the rough set theory is, it can only handle symbolic attributes. In order to overcome this drawback, the fuzzy rough set model is proposed, which is an extended model of rough sets and is able to deal with imprecision and uncertainty in both symbolic and numerical attributes. The existing attribute selection algorithms based on the fuzzy rough set model mainly take the angle of "attribute set," which means they define the object function representing the predictive ability for an attribute subset with regard to the domain of discourse, rather than following the view of an "object pair." Algorithms from the viewpoint of the object pair can ignore the object pairs that are already discerned by the selected attribute subsets and, thus, need only to deal with part of object pairs instead of the whole object pairs from the discourse, which makes such algorithms more efficient in attribute selection. In this paper, we propose the concept of reduced maximal discernibility pairs, which directly adopts the perspective of the object pair in the framework of the fuzzy rough set model. Then, we develop two attribute selection algorithms, named as reduced maximal discernibility pairs selection and weighted reduced maximal discernibility pair selection, based on the reduced maximal discernibility pairs. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient in attribute selection.

Moreover, we discuss exciting new opportunities for integrated localization and sensing applications, which will disrupt traditional design principles and revolutionize the way we live, interact with our environment, and do business. Regarding potential enabling technologies, 6G will continue to develop towards even higher frequency ranges, wider bandwidths, and massive antenna arrays. In turn, this will enable sensing solutions with very fine range, Doppler, and angular resolutions, as well as localization to cm-level degree of accuracy. Besides, new materials, device types, and reconfigurable surfaces will allow network operators to reshape and control the electromagnetic response of the environment. At the same time, machine learning and artificial intelligence will leverage the unprecedented availability of data and computing resources to tackle the biggest and hardest problems in wireless communication systems. As a result, 6G will be truly intelligent wireless systems that will provide not only ubiquitous communication but also empower high accuracy localization and high-resolution sensing services. They will become the catalyst for this revolution by bringing about a unique new set of features and service capabilities, where localization and sensing will coexist with communication, continuously sharing the available resources in time, frequency, and space. This work concludes by highlighting foundational research challenges, as well as implications and opportunities related to privacy, security, and trust.

Equivalent-accuracy accelerated neural-network training using analogue memory	NATURE			English	Article							SYNAPSES; DEVICES	Neural-network training can be slow and energy intensive, owing to the need to transfer the weight data for the network between conventional digital memory chips and processor chips. Analogue non-volatile memory can accelerate the neural-network training algorithm known as backpropagation by performing parallelized multiply-accumulate operations in the analogue domain at the location of the weight data. However, the classification accuracies of such in situ training using non-volatile-memory hardware have generally been less than those of software-based training, owing to insufficient dynamic range and excessive weight-update asymmetry. Here we demonstrate mixed hardware-software neural-network implementations that involve up to 204,900 synapses and that combine long-term storage in phase-change memory, near-linear updates of volatile capacitors and weight-data transfer with 'polarity inversion' to cancel out inherent device-to-device variations. We achieve generalization accuracies (on previously unseen data) equivalent to those of software-based training on various commonly used machine-learning test datasets (MNIST, MNIST-backrand, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100). The computational energy efficiency of 28,065 billion operations per second per watt and throughput per area of 3.6 trillion operations per second per square millimetre that we calculate for our implementation exceed those of today's graphical processing units by two orders of magnitude. This work provides a path towards hardware accelerators that are both fast and energy efficient, particularly on fully connected neural-network layers.

Therefore, real-time epilepsy monitoring and seizure detection has become important over the past decades. In this context, wearable technologies offer a promising solution to pervasive epilepsy monitoring by removing the constraints with respect to time and location. In this paper, we propose a self-aware wearable system for real-time detection of epileptic seizures on a long-term basis. First, we propose a multi-parametric machine learning technique to detect seizures by analyzing both cardiac and respiratory responses to seizures, which are obtained using only the ECG signal. Second, in order to enable long-time epilepsy detection, we introduce the notion of self-awareness in our real-time wearable system. We evaluate the performance of our proposed solution based on an epilepsy database of more than 211 hours of recording, provided by the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), on the INYU wearable sensor. Our proposed system achieves a sensitivity of 88.66% and a specificity of 85.65% before applying self-awareness. Moreover, by controlling the energy-quality trade-offs using our self-aware energy-management technique, we can tune the battery lifetime of the wearable system to last between 67.55 and 136.91 days while, still outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques for wearable seizure detection, by achieving from 85.54% to 79.33% geometric mean of specificity and sensitivity.

In WSNs for IoT, intelligent routing is an important phenomena that is necessary to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) in the network. Moreover, the energy required for communication in the IoT based sensor networks is an important challenge to avoid immense packet loss or packet drop, fast energy depletion and unfairness across the network leading to reduction in node performance and increase in delay with respect to packet delivery. Hence, there is an extreme need to check energy usage by the nodes in order to enhance the overall network performance through the application of intelligent machine learning techniques for making effective routing decisions. Many approaches are already available in the literature on energy efficient routing for WSNs. However, they must be enhanced to suite the WSN in IoT environment. Therefore, a new Neuro-Fuzzy Rule Based Cluster Formation and Routing Protocol for performing efficient routing in IoT based WSNs. From the experiments conducted in this research work using the proposed model, it is proved that the proposed routing algorithm provided better network performance in terms of the metrics namely energy utilization, packet delivery ratio, delay and network lifetime.

IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

In this context, a robust and innovative automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) algorithm was developed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images to design early post-emergence prescription maps. This novel algorithm makes the major contribution. The OBIA algorithm combined Digital Surface Models (DSMs), orthomosaics and machine learning techniques (Random Forest, RF). OBIA-based plant heights were accurately estimated and used as a feature in the automatic sample selection by the RF classifier; this was the second research contribution. RF randomly selected a class balanced training set, obtained the optimum features values and classified the image, requiring no manual training, making this procedure time-efficient and more accurate, since it removes errors due to a subjective manual task. The ability to discriminate weeds was significantly affected by the imagery spatial resolution and weed density, making the use of higher spatial resolution images more suitable. Finally, prescription maps for in-season post-emergence SSWM were created based on the weed mapsthe third research contributionwhich could help farmers in decision-making to optimize crop management by rationalization of the herbicide application. The short time involved in the process (image capture and analysis) would allow timely weed control during critical periods, crucial for preventing yield loss.

Plants respond to wounding stress by changing gene expression patterns and inducing the production of hormones including jasmonic acid. This wounding transcriptional response activates specialized metabolism pathways such as the glucosinolate pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. While the regulatory factors and sequences controlling a subset of wound-response genes are known, it remains unclear how wound response is regulated globally. Here, we how these responses are regulated by incorporating putative cis-regulatory elements, known transcription factor binding sites, in vitro DNA affinity purification sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitive sites to predict genes with different wound-response patterns using machine learning. We observed that regulatory sites and regions of open chromatin differed between genes upregulated at early and late wounding time-points as well as between genes induced by jasmonic acid and those not induced. Expanding on what we currently know, we identified cis-elements that improved model predictions of expression clusters over known binding sites. Using a combination of genome editing, in vitro DNA-binding assays, and transient expression assays using native and mutated cis-regulatory elements, we experimentally validated four of the predicted elements, three of which were not previously known to function in wound-response regulation. Our study provides a global model predictive of wound response and identifies new regulatory sequences important for wounding without requiring prior knowledge of the transcriptional regulators.

The composition of the gut microbiome has been associated with clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, but there is limited consensus on the specific microbiome characteristics linked to the clinical benefits of ICIs. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples collected before ICI initiation from five observational cohorts recruiting ICI-naive patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 165). Integrating the dataset with 147 metagenomic samples from previously published studies, we found that the gut microbiome has a relevant, but cohort-dependent, association with the response to ICIs. A machine learning analysis confirmed the link between the microbiome and overall response rates (ORRs) and progression-free survival (PFS) with ICIs but also revealed limited reproducibility of microbiome-based signatures across cohorts. Accordingly, a panel of species, including Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Roseburia spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with responders was identified, but no single species could be regarded as a fully consistent biomarker across studies. Overall, the role of the human gut microbiome in ICI response appears more complex than previously thought, extending beyond differing microbial species simply present or absent in responders and nonresponders. Future studies should adopt larger sample sizes and take into account the complex interplay of clinical factors with the gut microbiome over the treatment course.

This Review discusses the mechanisms of neoantigen T cell recognition and computational approaches to predict which neoantigens might confer proficient antitumour immunity in a given clinical context. Somatic mutations in cancer cells can generate tumour-specific neoepitopes, which are recognized by autologous T cells in the host. As neoepitopes are not subject to central immune tolerance and are not expressed in healthy tissues, they are attractive targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines. Because the vast majority of cancer mutations are unique to the individual patient, harnessing the full potential of this rich source of targets requires individualized treatment approaches. Many computational algorithms and machine-learning tools have been developed to identify mutations in sequence data, to prioritize those that are more likely to be recognized by T cells and to design tailored vaccines for every patient. In this Review, we fill the gaps between the understanding of basic mechanisms of T cell recognition of neoantigens and the computational approaches for discovery of somatic mutations and neoantigen prediction for cancer immunotherapy. We present a new classification of neoantigens, distinguishing between guarding, restrained and ignored neoantigens, based on how they confer proficient antitumour immunity in a given clinical context. Such context-based differentiation will contribute to a framework that connects neoantigen biology to the clinical setting and medical peculiarities of cancer, and will enable future neoantigen-based therapies to provide greater clinical benefit.

But the ability to distort reality has taken an exponential leap forward with "deep fake" technology. This capability makes it possible to create audio and video of real people saying and doing things they never said or did. Machine learning techniques are escalating the technology's sophistication, making deep fakes ever more realistic and increasingly resistant to detection. Deep-fake technology has characteristics that enable rapid and widespread diffusion, putting it into the hands of both sophisticated and unsophisticated actors. While deep-fake technology will bring certain benefits, it also will introduce many harms. The marketplace of ideas already suffers from truth decay as our networked information environment interacts in toxic ways with our cognitive biases. Deep fakes will exacerbate this problem significantly. Individuals and businesses will face novel forms of exploitation, intimidation, and personal sabotage. The risks to our democracy and to national security are profound as well. Our aim is to provide the first in-depth assessment of the causes and consequences of this disruptive technological change, and to explore the existing and potential tools for responding to it. We survey a broad array of responses, including: the role of technological solutions; criminal penalties, civil liability, and regulatory action; military and covert-action responses; economic sanctions; and market developments. We cover the waterfront from immunities to immutable authentication trails, offering recommendations to improve law and policy and anticipating the pitfalls embedded in various solutions.

Systematic characterization of the cancer microbiome provides the opportunity to develop techniques that exploit non-human, microorganism-derived molecules in the diagnosis of a major human disease. Following recent demonstrations that some types of cancer show substantial microbial contributions(1-10), we re-examined whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas(11) (TCGA) of 33 types of cancer from treatment-naive patients (a total of 18,116 samples) for microbial reads, and found unique microbial signatures in tissue and blood within and between most major types of cancer. These TCGA blood signatures remained predictive when applied to patients with stage Ia-IIc cancer and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade cell-free tumour DNA platforms, despite the use of very stringent decontamination analyses that discarded up to 92.3% of total sequence data. In addition, we could discriminate among samples from healthy, cancer-free individuals (n = 69) and those from patients with multiple types of cancer (prostate, lung, and melanoma; 100 samples in total) solely using plasma-derived, cell-free microbial nucleic acids. This potential microbiome-based oncology diagnostic tool warrants further exploration.

Here, we conducted a study to investigate the potential use of ctDNA methylation markers for the diagnosis and prognostication of colorectal cancer (CRC) and used a prospective cohort to validate their effectiveness in screening patients at high risk of CRC. We first identified CRC-specific methylation signatures by comparing CRC tissues to normal blood leukocytes. Then, we applied a machine learning algorithm to develop a predictive diagnostic and a prognostic model using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples from a cohort of 801 patients with CRC and 1021 normal controls. The obtained diagnostic prediction model discriminated patients with CRC from normal controls with high accuracy (area under curve = 0.96). The prognostic prediction model also effectively predicted the prognosis and survival of patients with CRC (P < 0.001). In addition, we generated a ctDNA-based molecular classification of CRC using an unsupervised clustering method and obtained two subgroups of patients with CRC with significantly different overall survival (P = 0.011 in validation cohort). Last, we found that a single ctDNA methylation marker, cg10673833, could yield high sensitivity (89.7%) and specificity (86.8%) for detection of CRC and precancerous lesions in a high-risk population of 1493 participants in a prospective cohort study. Together, our findings showed the value of ctDNA methylation markers in the diagnosis, surveillance, and prognosis of CRC.

It has been widely tailored for a wide variety of optimization problems due to its impressive characteristics over other swarm intelligence methods: it has very few parameters, and no derivation information is required in the initial search. Also it is simple, easy to use, flexible, scalable, and has a special capability to strike the right balance between the exploration and exploitation during the search which leads to favourable convergence. Therefore, the GWO has recently gained a very big research interest with tremendous audiences from several domains in a very short time. Thus, in this review paper, several research publications using GWO have been overviewed and summarized. Initially, an introductory information about GWO is provided which illustrates the natural foundation context and its related optimization conceptual framework. The main operations of GWO are procedurally discussed, and the theoretical foundation is described. Furthermore, the recent versions of GWO are discussed in detail which are categorized into modified, hybridized and paralleled versions. The main applications of GWO are also thoroughly described. The applications belong to the domains of global optimization, power engineering, bioinformatics, environmental applications, machine learning, networking and image processing, etc. The open source software of GWO is also provided. The review paper is ended by providing a summary conclusion of the main foundation of GWO and suggests several possible future directions that can be further investigated.

Ultrafast hole spin qubit with gate-tunable spin-orbit switch functionality	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SINGLE-ELECTRON SPIN; QUANTUM; COHERENCE	Quantum computers promise to execute complex tasks exponentially faster than any possible classical computer, and thus spur breakthroughs in quantum chemistry, material science and machine learning. However, quantum computers require fast and selective control of large numbers of individual qubits while maintaining coherence. Qubits based on hole spins in one-dimensional germanium/silicon nanostructures are predicted to experience an exceptionally strong yet electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction, which allows us to optimize qubit performance by switching between distinct modes of ultrafast manipulation, long coherence and individual addressability. Here we used millivolt gate voltage changes to tune the Rabi frequency of a hole spin qubit in a germanium/silicon nanowire from 31 to 219 MHz, its driven coherence time between 7 and 59 ns, and its Lande g-factor from 0.83 to 1.27. We thus demonstrated spin-orbit switch functionality, with on/off ratios of roughly seven, which could be further increased through improved gate design. Finally, we used this control to optimize our qubit further and approach the strong driving regime, with spin-flipping times as short as similar to 1 ns. Quantum computing requires fast and selective control of a large number of individual qubits while maintaining coherence, which is hard to achieve concomitantly. All-electrical operation of a hole spin qubit in a Ge/Si nanowire demonstrates the principle of switching from a mode of selective and fast control to idling with increased coherence.

To contain its spread, China adopted unprecedented nationwide interventions on January 23 2020. These policies included large-scale quarantine, strict controls on travel and extensive monitoring of suspected cases. However, it is unknown whether these policies have had an impact on the epidemic. We sought to show how these control measures impacted the containment of the epidemic. Methods: We integrated population migration data before and after January 23 and most updated COVID-19 epidemiological data into the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to derive the epidemic curve. We also used an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, trained on the 2003 SARS data, to predict the epidemic. Results: We found that the epidemic of China should peak by late February, showing gradual decline by end of April. A five-day delay in implementation would have increased epidemic size in mainland China three-fold. Lifting the Hubei quarantine would lead to a second epidemic peak in Hubei province in mid-March and extend the epidemic to late April, a result corroborated by the machine learning prediction. Conclusions: Our dynamic SEIR model was effective in predicting the COVID-19 epidemic peaks and sizes. The implementation of control measures on January 23 2020 was indispensable in reducing the eventual COVID-19 epidemic size.

Nowadays, the glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) becomes a new tendon material instead of steel to avoid the performance degradation resulting from steel corrosion. The interface bond strength of GFRP tendon-reinforced cemented soils (GTRCS) displays its excellent mechanical capacity. Nevertheless, its application is obstructed by the deficient studies between the bond strength and influence factors. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of varying water contents (Cw: 50%-90%), cement proportions (Cc: 6%-30%), and curing periods (Tc: 28 days, 90 days) on both pullout strength (Tp) and unconfined compression strength (UCS) of GTRCS. The results showed that the pullout strength and compressive strength were positively related to Tc and Cc and negatively related to Cw. Besides, these experimental results were also utilised to develop support vector regression (SVR) models. The beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm was used to adjust the SVR's hyperparameters. The high correlation coefficients (0.988 for UCS and 0.972 for Tp) proved the reliability of the established BAS-SVR models. In addition, the multi-objective beetle antennae search algorithm (MOBAS-SVR) was developed for bi-objective optimisation designs (UCS-cost and Tp-cost). Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to range the significance of variables for Tp and UCS.

S.; Wuerthner, Frank			Perspectives in Dye Chemistry: A Rational Approach toward Functional Materials by Understanding the Aggregate State	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Review							SINGLET FISSION; ENERGY-TRANSFER; CHARGE SEPARATION; EXCIMER FORMATION; STACKING INTERACTIONS; EXCITON DYNAMICS; MEROCYANINE DYES; PI-STACKS; DESIGN; MOLECULES	The past 20 years have witnessed a renaissance of dye chemistry, moving from traditional colorant research toward functional materials. Different from traditional colorant research, the properties of functional materials are governed extensively by intermolecular interactions, thereby entailing significant limitations to the classical approach based on molecular structure-molecular property (color, emission, redox properties, etc.) relationships for the respective dye molecules. However, as discussed in this Perspective, such an approach can be pursued for dye aggregates, and in many cases already well-tailored dimers are sufficient to understand the influence of supramolecular organization on the functional properties of ground and photoexcited states. Illustrative examples will be given for exciton coupling and charge-transfer coupling and how these properties relate to desirable functions such as fluorescence, symmetry-breaking charge separation, and singlet fission in molecular aggregates. While the progress in this research so far mostly originated from studies on well-defined folded and self-assembled structures composed of only two dye molecules, future work will have to advance toward larger oligomers of specific size and geometry. Furthermore, future experimental studies should be guided to a larger extent by theoretical predictions that may be supported by machine learning algorithms and new concepts from artificial intelligence. Beyond already pursued calculations of potential energy landscapes, we suggest the development of theoretical approaches that identify the most desirable dye aggregate structures for a particular property on functional energy landscapes.

The present study discusses such freshwater wetland system in Eastern India to understand its microplastics transport mechanism, heavy metals association and microplastics removal efficiency. Microplastics (63 mu m 5 mm) were heavily found in surface water and sediments of treatment ponds (7.87 to 20.39 items/L and 2124.84 to 6886.76 items/kg) and associated wastewater canals (30.46 to 137.72 items/L and 1108.78 to 34612.87 items/kg). A high content of toxic metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were found on the microplastics with polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene as major plastics types which were also found in fishes and macroinvertebrates of treatment ponds. Machine learning algorithm revealed a close association between microplastics content in fishes and surface water, indicating risk associated with floating microplastics to the aquatic biota. The study also revealed that microplastics were acting as heavy metals vector and potentially causing fish contamination. Surface water microplastics removing efficiency of the treatment ponds was estimated to be 53%. The study bespeaks about transport of microplastics through wastewater canals and their retention in treatment ponds emphasizing sustainability maintenance of natural wastewater treatment systems especially considering microplastics contamination to the aquatic biota of freshwater wetland systems.

Automated hash-matching and predictive machine learning tools - what we define here as algorithmic moderation systems - are increasingly being deployed to conduct content moderation at scale by major platforms for user-generated content such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. This article provides an accessible technical primer on how algorithmic moderation works; examines some of the existing automated tools used by major platforms to handle copyright infringement, terrorism and toxic speech; and identifies key political and ethical issues for these systems as the reliance on them grows. Recent events suggest that algorithmic moderation has become necessary to manage growing public expectations for increased platform responsibility, safety and security on the global stage; however, as we demonstrate, these systems remain opaque, unaccountable and poorly understood. Despite the potential promise of algorithms or 'AI', we show that even 'well optimized' moderation systems could exacerbate, rather than relieve, many existing problems with content policy as enacted by platforms for three main reasons: automated moderation threatens to (a) further increase opacity, making a famously non-transparent set of practices even more difficult to understand or audit, (b) further complicate outstanding issues of fairness and justice in large-scale sociotechnical systems and (c) re-obscure the fundamentally political nature of speech decisions being executed at scale.

J	Thuruthel, TG; Shih, B; Laschi, C; Tolley, MT				Thuruthel, Thomas George; Shih, Benjamin; Laschi, Cecilia; Tolley, Michael Thomas			Soft robot perception using embedded soft sensors and recurrent neural networks	SCIENCE ROBOTICS			English	Article							STRAIN SENSORS; POSITION	Recent work has begun to explore the design of biologically inspired soft robots composed of soft, stretchable materials for applications including the handling of delicate materials and safe interaction with humans. However, the solid-state sensors traditionally used in robotics are unable to capture the high-dimensional deformations of soft systems. Embedded soft resistive sensors have the potential to address this challenge. However, both the soft sensors-and the encasing dynamical system-often exhibit nonlinear time-variant behavior, which makes them difficult to model. In addition, the problems of sensor design, placement, and fabrication require a great deal of human input and previous knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the human perceptive system, we created a synthetic analog. Our synthetic system builds models using a redundant and unstructured sensor topology embedded in a soft actuator, a vision-based motion capture system for ground truth, and a general machine learning approach. This allows us to model an unknown soft actuated system. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to model the kinematics of a soft continuum actuator in real time while being robust to sensor nonlinearities and drift. In addition, we show how the same system can estimate the applied forces while interacting with external objects. The role of action in perception is also presented. This approach enables the development of force and deformation models for soft robotic systems, which can be useful for a variety of applications, including human-robot interaction, soft orthotics, and wearable robotics.

J	Lamichhane, S; Kumar, L; Wilson, B				Lamichhane, Sushil; Kumar, Lalit; Wilson, Brian			Digital soil mapping algorithms and covariates for soil organic carbon mapping and their implications: A review	GEODERMA			English	Review						Algorithms; Covariates; Digital soil mapping; Soil organic carbon; Systematic mapping; Validation	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; BASE-LINE MAP; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPATIAL PREDICTION; LAND-USE; RANDOM FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGIONAL-SCALE; TERRAIN ATTRIBUTES	This article reviews the current research and applications of various digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques used to map Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) concentration and stocks following a systematic mapping approach from 2013 until present (18 February 2019). It is intended that this review of relevant literature will assist prospective researchers by identifying knowledge clusters and gaps in relation to the digital mapping of SOC. Of 120 studies, most were clustered in some specific countries such as China, Australia and the USA. The highest number publications were in 2016 and 2017. Regarding the predictive models, there was a progression from Linear Models towards Machine Learning (ML) techniques, and hybrid models in Regression Kriging (RK) framework performed better than individual models. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was the most frequently used method for predicting SOC, although it was outperformed by other ML techniques in most studies. Random Forest (RF) was found to perform better than MLR and other ML techniques in most comparative studies. Other common and competitive techniques were Cubist, Neural Network (NN), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Due to the inconsistency in various comparative studies, it would be advisable to calibrate the competitive algorithms using specific experimental datasets. This review also reveals the environmental covariates that have been identified as the most important by RF technique in recent years in regard to digital mapping of SOC, which may assist in selecting optimum sets of environmental covariates for mapping SOC. Covariates representing organism/organic activities were among the most frequent among top five covariates, followed by the variables representing climate and topography. Climate was reported to be influential in determining the variation in SOC level at regional scales, followed by parent materials, topography and land use. However, for mapping at a resolution that represents smaller areas such as a farm- or plot-scale, land use and vegetation indices were stated to be more influential in predicting SOC. Furthermore, unlike a previous review work, all recent studies in this review incorporated validation and 41% of them estimated spatially explicit prediction of uncertainty. Only 9.16% studies performed external validation, whereas most studies used data-splitting and cross-validation techniques which may not be the best options for datasets obtained through non-probability sampling.

To improve the robustness of CNN in open-set recognition (OSR) and meanwhile maintain its high accuracy in CSR, we propose an alternative deep framework called convolutional prototype network (CPN), which keeps CNN for representation learning but replaces the closed-world assumed softmax with an open-world oriented and human-like prototype model. To equip CPN with discriminative ability for classifying known samples, we design several discriminative losses for training. Moreover, to increase the robustness of CPN for unknowns, we interpret CPN from the perspective of generative model and further propose a generative loss, which is essentially maximizing the log-likelihood of known samples and serves as a latent regularization for discriminative learning. The combination of discriminative and generative losses makes CPN a hybrid model with advantages for both CSR and OSR. Under the designed losses, the CPN is trained end-to-end for learning the convolutional network and prototypes jointly. For application of CPN in OSR, we propose two rejection rules for detecting different types of unknowns. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CPN for both CSR and OSR tasks.

In this paper, we present a novel Binary Multi-View Clustering (BMVC) framework, which can dexterously manipulate multi-view image data and easily scale to large data. To achieve this goal, we formulate BMVC by two key components: compact collaborative discrete representation learning and binary clustering structure learning, in a joint learning framework. Specifically, BMVC collaboratively encodes the multi-view image descriptors into a compact common binary code space by considering their complementary information; the collaborative binary representations are meanwhile clustered by a binary matrix factorization model, such t hat the cluster structures are optimized in the Hamming space by pure, extremely fast bit-operations. For efficiency, the code balance constraints are imposed on both binary data representations and cluster centroids. Finally, the resulting optimization problem is solved by an alternating optimization scheme with guaranteed fast convergence. Extensive experiments on four large-scale multi-view image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enjoys the significant reduction in both computation and memory footprint, while observing superior (in most cases) or very competitive performance, in comparison with state-of-the-art clustering methods.

J	Khatibi, R; Nadiri, AA				Khatibi, Rahman; Nadiri, Ata Allah			Inclusive Multiple Models (IMM) for predicting groundwater levels and treating heterogeneity	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Exclusionary multiple modelling (EMM); Groundwater level prediction; Inclusive multiple modelling (IMM); Model management practices	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; SUPERVISED COMMITTEE MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; FUZZY-LOGIC; NEURAL-NETWORKS; AQUIFER; VULNERABILITY; STRATEGY; PARAMETERS	An explicit model management framework is introduced for predictive Groundwater Levels (GWL), particularly suitable to Observation Wells (OWs) with sparse and possibly heterogeneous data. The framework implements Multiple Models (MM) under the architecture of organising them at levels, as follows: (i) Level 0: treat heterogeneity in the data, e.g. Self-Organised Mapping (SOM) to classify the OWs; and decide on model structure, e.g. formulate a grey box model to predict GWLs. (ii) Level 1: construct MMs, e.g. two Fuzzy Logic (FL) and one Neurofuzzy (NF) models. (iii) Level 2: formulate strategies to combine the MM at Level 1, for which the paper uses Artificial Neural Networks (Strategy 1) and simple averaging (Strategy 2). Whilst the above model management strategy is novel, a critical view is presented, according to which modelling practices are: Inclusive Multiple Modelling (IMM) practices contrasted with existing practices, branded by the paper as Exclusionary Multiple Modelling (EMM). Scientific thinking over IMMs is captured as a framework with four dimensions: Model Reuse (MR), Hierarchical Recursion (HR), Elastic Learning Environment (ELE) and Goal Orientation (GO) and these together make the acronym of RHEO. Therefore, IMM-RHEO is piloted in the aquifer of Tabriz Plain with sparse and possibly heterogeneous data. The results provide some evidence that (i) IMM at two levels improves on the accuracy of individual models; and (ii) model combinations in IMM practices bring 'model-learning' into fashion for learning with the goal to explain baseline conditions and impacts of subsequent management changes.

J	Chen, W; Li, Y				Chen, Wei; Li, Yang			GIS-based evaluation of landslide susceptibility using hybrid computational intelligence models	CATENA			English	Article						Reduced error pruning tree; Bagging; Dagging; Real Adaboost; Landslide	EVIDENTIAL BELIEF FUNCTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SPATIAL PREDICTION; SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; FREQUENCY RATIO; CERTAINTY FACTOR; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION TREE	Landslides have caused huge economic and human losses in China. Mapping of landslide susceptibility is an important tool to prevent and control landslide disasters. The purpose of this study is to make use of a hybrid machine learning approach by combining the reduced-error pruning trees (Rept) with a series of ensemble techniques (Bagging, Dagging, and Real Adaboost) and compare the performance of each combination for landslide susceptibility modeling. The combination of Rept model and Real Adaboost (RRept)is a novel application in the field of landslide susceptibility. Firstly, a landslide inventory map was prepared with 298 determined historical landslides events in the study area, 209 landslides (70%) were randomly selected for the training dataset and the remaining 89 landslides (30%) were used for validation dataset. On this basis, 16 landslide influencing factors were included in the landslide susceptibility evaluation (slope angle, elevation, slope aspect, sediment transport index (STI), topographical wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), profile curvature, plan curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to faults, soil, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse, lithology and rainfall). Secondly, the correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) method was used to select the most important factors for the proposed landslide susceptibility model. The results show that all the factors contribute to the occurrence of landslide. Slope angle, Landuse, Elevation, Distance to roads, Soil and Lithology have the greatest influence on the occurrence of landslide. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC), standard error (SE), 95% confidence interval and mean absolute error (MAE) were then used to validate and compare the performance of the model. The best model should have the largest AUC value, the smallest SE, the narrowest 95% CI and the smallest MAE. The results show that the three hybrid models perform better than the Rept model alone. For the training data set, the RRept model has highest AUC value (0.927), the smallest SE (0.121), the narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.898-0.95) and the lowest MAE (0.20). For the validation data set, the RRept model has the highest AUC value (0.745), the narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.674-0.807) and the lowest MAE (0.33). The RRept has the highest predictive power for landslide susceptibility evaluation. The results show that a hybrid method improves the prediction ability of the base Rept model. In addition, the RRept model is a promising comprehensive model that can be applied to landslide susceptibility mapping.

Still, lack of interpretability remains a significant barrier to clinical integration. We present an approach for predicting clinically-relevant molecular phenotypes from whole-slide histopathology images using human-interpretable image features (HIFs). Our method leverages >1.6 million annotations from board-certified pathologists across >5700 samples to train deep learning models for cell and tissue classification that can exhaustively map whole-slide images at two and four micron-resolution. Cell- and tissue-type model outputs are combined into 607 HIFs that quantify specific and biologically-relevant characteristics across five cancer types. We demonstrate that these HIFs correlate with well-known markers of the tumor microenvironment and can predict diverse molecular signatures (AUROC 0.601-0.864), including expression of four immune checkpoint proteins and homologous recombination deficiency, with performance comparable to 'black-box' methods. Our HIF-based approach provides a comprehensive, quantitative, and interpretable window into the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment. Computational methods have made progress in improving classification accuracy and throughput of pathology workflows, but lack of interpretability remains a barrier to clinical integration. Here, the authors present an approach for predicting clinically-relevant molecular phenotypes from whole-slide histopathology images using human-interpretable image features.

In this article, we present a DDoS traffic detection model that uses a boosting method of logistic model trees for different IoT device classes. Specifically, a different version of the model will be generated and applied for each device class since the characteristics of the network traffic from each device class may have subtle variation(s). As a case study, we explain how devices in a typical smart home environment can be categorized into four different classes (and in our context, Class 1-very high level of traffic predictability, Class 2-high level of traffic predictability, Class 3-medium level of traffic predictability, and Class 4-low level of traffic predictability). Findings from our evaluations show that the accuracy of our proposed approach is between 99.92% and 99.99% for these four device classes. In other words, we demonstrate that we can use device classes to help us more effectively detect DDoS traffic.

However, these methods require large numbers of labeled samples, which are usually time-consuming and high-priced for PolSAR images. To address this issue, a semisupervised method based on a 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D-CNN) using pseudo labels (PL-3-D-CNN) is proposed. First, the coherency matrix of PolSAR data is converted into a 6-D real-valued vector by a unitary transformation. Then, the K-means algorithm is utilized for generating pseudo labels. After that, labeled samples and pseudo labeled samples are fed into the PL-3-D-CNN model to extract supervised and unsupervised features. Finally, the supervised and unsupervised features are combined to improve classification accuracy. The proposed method is tested on both AIRSAR and RADARSAT-2 data sets. The results show that the proposed method is an effective method for PolSAR image classification and shows good performance under a small number of labeled samples.

J	Ding, CX; Tao, DC				Ding, Changxing; Tao, Dacheng			Trunk-Branch Ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks for Video-Based Face Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Video-based face recognition; video surveillance; blur- and pose-robust representations; convolutional neural networks		Human faces in surveillance videos often suffer from severe image blur, dramatic pose variations, and occlusion. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to overcome challenges in video-based face recognition (VFR). First, to learn blur-robust face representations, we artificially blur training data composed of clear still images to account for a shortfall in real-world video training data. Using training data composed of both still images and artificially blurred data, CNN is encouraged to learn blur-insensitive features automatically. Second, to enhance robustness of CNN features to pose variations and occlusion, we propose a Trunk-Branch Ensemble CNN model (TBE-CNN), which extracts complementary information from holistic face images and patches cropped around facial components. TBE-CNN is an end-to-end model that extracts features efficiently by sharing the low- and middle-level convolutional layers between the trunk and branch networks. Third, to further promote the discriminative power of the representations learnt by TBE-CNN, we propose an improved triplet loss function. Systematic experiments justify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, TBE-CNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular video face databases: PaSC, COX Face, and YouTube Faces. With the proposed techniques, we also obtain the first place in the BTAS 2016 Video Person Recognition Evaluation.

This function considers only the classification information contained in the lower approximation of the decision while ignoring the upper approximation. In this paper, we construct a class of uncertainty measures: decision self-information for the feature selection. These measures take into account the uncertainty information in the lower and the upper approximations. The relationships between these measures and their properties are discussed in detail. It is proven that the fourth measure, called relative neighborhood self-information, is better for feature selection than the other measures, because not only does it consider both the lower and the upper approximations but also the change of its magnitude is largest with the variation of feature subsets. This helps to facilitate the selection of optimal feature subsets. Finally, a greedy algorithm for feature selection has been designed and a series of numerical experiments was carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm often chooses fewer features and improves the classification accuracy in most cases.

Compared with von Neumann architectures, which have separate processing and storage units, brain-inspired in-memory computing uses the same basic device structure for logic operations and data storage(1-3), thus promising to reduce the energy cost of data-centred computing substantially(4). Although there is ample research focused on exploring new device architectures, the engineering of material platforms suitable for such device designs remains a challenge. Two-dimensional materials(5,6) such as semiconducting molybdenum disulphide, MoS2, could be promising candidates for such platforms thanks to their exceptional electrical and mechanical properties(7-9). Here we report our exploration of large-area MoS2 as an active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs). The conductance of our FGFETs can be precisely and continuously tuned, allowing us to use them as building blocks for reconfigurable logic circuits in which logic operations can be directly performed using the memory elements. After demonstrating a programmable NOR gate, we show that this design can be simply extended to implement more complex programmable logic and a functionally complete set of operations. Our findings highlight the potential of atomically thin semiconductors for the development of next-generation low-power electronics. Logic operations and reconfigurable circuits are demonstrated that can be directly implemented using memory elements based on floating-gate field-effect transistors with monolayer MoS2 as the active channel material.

J	Yan, XA; Jia, MP				Yan, Xiaoan; Jia, Minping			Intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery using improved multiscale dispersion entropy and mRMR feature selection	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Improved multiscale dispersion entropy; mRMR; Rotating machinery; Fault diagnosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; LOCAL MEAN DECOMPOSITION; PERMUTATION ENTROPY; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; FUZZY ENTROPY; BEARINGS; SCHEME	Intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is essentially a pattern recognition problem. Meanwhile, effective feature extraction from the raw vibration signal is an important procedure for timely detection of mechanical health status and the assessment of fault recognition results. Therefore, to efficiently extract fault feature information and improve fault diagnosis accuracy, a novel fault diagnosis technique based on improved multiscale dispersion entropy (IMDE) and max-relevance min-redundancy (mRMR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the IMDE method is developed to capture multi-scale fault features from the collected original vibration signal, which can overcome the deficiencies of traditional multiscale entropy and improve the stability of the recently presented multiscale dispersion entropy (MDE). Then, the mRMR algorithm is utilized to select automatically the sensitive features from the candidate multi scale features without any prior knowledge. Finally, the sensitive feature vector set after normalization treatment is inputted into the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier to train the intelligent diagnosis model and provide fault diagnosis results. The validity of our proposed method is assessed through two experimental examples. The experimental results show that our proposed method works efficiently for identification of different fault conditions of mechanical components including rolling bearing and gearbox. Moreover, our proposed method gives better diagnosis results as compared to some existing approaches (e.g. MSE and MPE) when being utilized for fault condition classification. This research provides a new perspective for fault information extraction and fault classification of rotating machinery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As FS is known to be an NP-hard problem, the aim of this paper is to introduce basically a new variant of Salp Swarm Optimizer (SSA) for FS (called ISSAFD (Improved Followers of Salp swarm Algorithm using Sine Cosine algorithm and Disrupt Operator), that updates the position of followers (F) in SSA using sinusoidal mathematical functions that were inspired from the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). This enhancement helps to improve the exploration phase and to avoid stagnation in a local area. Moreover, the Disruption Operator (D-op) is applied for all solutions, in order to enhance the population diversity and to maintain the balance between exploration and exploitation processes. Two other variants of SSA are developed based on SCA called ISSALD (Improved Leaders of Salp swarm Algorithm using Sine Cosine algorithm and Disrupt Operator) and ISSAF (Improved Followers of Salp swarm Algorithm using Sine Cosine algorithm). The updating process in consists to update the leaders (L) position by SCA and applying (D-op), whereas in ISSAF, the D-op is omitted and the position of followers is updated by SCA. Experimental results are evaluated on twenty datasets where four of them represent high dimensionality with a small number of instances. The obtained results show a good performance of ISSAFD in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the number of selected features in comparison with other metaheuristics (MH).

These applications require higher data-rates, large bandwidth, increased capacity, low latency and high throughput. In light of these emerging concepts, IoT has revolutionized the world by providing seamless connectivity between heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The eventual aim of IoT is to introduce the plug and play technology providing the end-user, ease of operation, remotely access control and configurability. This paper presents the IoT technology from a bird's eye view covering its statistical/architectural trends, use cases, challenges and future prospects. The paper also presents a detailed and extensive overview of the emerging 5G-IoT scenario. Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks provide key enabling technologies for ubiquitous deployment of the IoT technology. These include carrier aggregation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (M-MIMO), coordinated multipoint processing (CoMP), device-to-device (D2D) communications, centralized radio access network (CRAN), software-defined wireless sensor networking (SD-WSN), network function virtualization (NFV) and cognitive radios (CRs). This paper presents an exhaustive review for these key enabling technologies and also discusses the new emerging use cases of 5G-IoT driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, ongoing 5G initiatives, quality of service (QoS) requirements in 5G and its standardization issues. Finally, the paper discusses challenges in the implementation of 5G-IoT due to high data-rates requiring both cloud-based platforms and IoT devices based edge computing.

The present study aimed to investigate whether or not salivary microbiota of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) differs from that of subjects without ACVD, and to characterize the salivary microbiota of patients with ACVD. Methods: This study included 43 patients with ACVD and 86 age- and sex-matched non-ACVD individuals. 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis were performed using DNA isolated from the saliva samples of the participants. To select unique operational taxonomic unit (OTU) sets of ACVD, we conducted the random forest algorithm in machine learning, followed by confirmation via 10-fold cross-validation Results: There was no difference in richness or evenness between the ACVD and non-ACVD groups (alpha diversity; observed OTU index, p-0.503; Shannon's index, p-0.478). However, significant differences were found in the overall salivary microbiota structure (beta diversity; unweighted UniFrac distances, p-0.001; weighted UniFrac distances, p-0.001). The Actinobacteria phylum was highly abundant in patients with ACVD, while the Bacteroidetes phylum was less abundant. The random forest classifier identified 43 OTUs as an optimal marker set of ACVD. In a 10-fold cross validation using the validation data, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.933 (95% CI, 0.855-1.000) was obtained. Conclusions: The salivary microbiota in patients with ACVD was distinct from that of non-ACVD individuals, indicating that the salivary microbiota may be related to ACVD.

Energy storage emerging: A perspective from the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						energy storage; Joint Center for Energy Storage Research; batteries; transportation; grid	SPARINGLY SOLVATING ELECTROLYTES; FLOW BATTERY; LITHIUM; DESIGN; INTERCALATION; TRANSPORT; MAGNESIUM; POLYMERS; CATHODE; DENSITY	Energy storage is an integral part of modern society. A contemporary example is the lithium (Li)-ion battery, which enabled the launch of the personal electronics revolution in 1991 and the first commercial electric vehicles in 2010. Most recently, Li-ion batteries have expanded into the electricity grid to firm variable renewable generation, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of transmission and distribution. Important applications continue to emerge including decarbonization of heavy-duty vehicles, rail, maritime shipping, and aviation and the growth of renewable electricity and storage on the grid. This perspective compares energy storage needs and priorities in 2010 with those now and those emerging over the next few decades. The diversity of demands for energy storage requires a diversity of purpose-built batteries designed to meet disparate applications. Advances in the frontier of battery research to achieve transformative performance spanning energy and power density, capacity, charge/discharge times, cost, lifetime, and safety are highlighted, along with strategic research refinements made by the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) and the broader community to accommodate the changing storage needs and priorities. Innovative experimental tools with higher spatial and temporal resolution, in situ and operando characterization, first-principles simulation, high throughput computation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence work collectively to reveal the origins of the electrochemical phenomena that enable new means of energy storage. This knowledge allows a constructionist approach to materials, chemistries, and architectures, where each atom or molecule plays a prescribed role in realizing batteries with unique performance profiles suitable for emergent demands.

The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people's mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.

Brain-age in midlife is associated with accelerated biological aging and cognitive decline in a longitudinal birth cohort	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LIFE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MORTALITY; EVOLUTION; ADULTHOOD; STRENGTH; SCIENCE; ABILITY; HEALTH	An individual's brainAGE is the difference between chronological age and age predicted from machine-learning models of brain-imaging data. BrainAGE has been proposed as a biomarker of age-related deterioration of the brain. Having an older brainAGE has been linked to Alzheimer's, dementia, and mortality. However, these findings are largely based on cross-sectional associations which can confuse age differences with cohort differences. To illuminate the validity of brainAGE as a biomarker of accelerated brain aging, a study is needed of a large cohort all born in the same year who nevertheless vary on brainAGE. In the Dunedin Study, a population-representative 1972-73 birth cohort, we measured brainAGE at age 45 years, as well as the pace of biological aging and cognitive decline in longitudinal data from childhood to midlife (N = 869). In this cohort, all chronological age 45 years, brainAGE was measured reliably (ICC = 0.81) and ranged from 24 to 72 years. Those with older midlife brainAGEs tended to have poorer cognitive function in both adulthood and childhood, as well as impaired brain health at age 3. Furthermore, those with older brainAGEs had an accelerated pace of biological aging, older facial appearance, and early signs of cognitive decline from childhood to midlife. These findings help to validate brainAGE as a potential surrogate biomarker for midlife intervention studies that seek to measure dementia-prevention efforts in midlife. However, the findings also caution against the assumption that brainAGE scores represent only age-related deterioration of the brain as they may also index central nervous system variation present since childhood.

However, large uncertainties still remain in the global GPP estimations and their long-termtrends. Here we used the satellite-based near-infrared reflectance (NIRv) as the proxy of GPP and generated a global long-term (1982-2018) GPP datasets (hereafter GPP(NIRv)). Analysis at the site-level showed that NIRv could accurately capture both the monthly and annual variations in GPP (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.74 respectively) at 104 flux sites. Upscaling the relationships between NIRv and GPP to the global scale, the global annual GPP was estimated to be 128.3 +/- 4.0 Pg C yr(-1) during the last four decades, which fell between the estimations from the machine-learning upscaling approach, light-use-efficiency (LUE) models and processed-based models. The seasonal variation of GPP(NIRv) was also consistent with those from flux sites and models. More importantly, the inter-annual trends in GPP(NIRv) during the last four decades were consistent with those from processed-based models across latitudes, which outperformed the other GPP products. This evidence suggested that the long-term GPP datasets derived from NIRv have better abilities to capture the seasonal and inter-annual variations of terrestrial GPP at the global scale. The long-term GPP(NIRv) product could be beneficial for the estimation of terrestrial carbon fluxes and for the projection of future climates. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The risk of obtaining false positives is exacerbated by wide interindividual heterogeneity in microbiota composition(1), probably due to population-wide differences in human lifestyle and physiological variables(2) that exert differential effects on the microbiota. Here we infer the greatest, generalized sources of heterogeneity in human gut microbiota profiles and also identify human lifestyle and physiological characteristics that, if not evenly matched between cases and controls, confound microbiota analyses to produce spurious microbial associations with human diseases. We identify alcohol consumption frequency and bowel movement quality as unexpectedly strong sources of gut microbiota variance that differ in distribution between healthy participants and participants with a disease and that can confound study designs. We demonstrate that for numerous prevalent, high-burden human diseases, matching cases and controls for confounding variables reduces observed differences in the microbiota and the incidence of spurious associations. On this basis, we present a list of host variables that we recommend should be captured in human microbiota studies for the purpose of matching comparison groups, which we anticipate will increase robustness and reproducibility in resolving the members of the gut microbiota that are truly associated with human disease. The authors use a machine-learning approach to uncover confounding variables in studies that seek to establish an association between the gut microbiota and human disease.

A metabolomics pipeline for the mechanistic interrogation of the gut microbiome	NATURE			English	Article							LONGITUDINAL MULTI-OMICS; REVEALS; ACIDS	Gut microorganisms modulate host phenotypes and are associated with numerous health effects in humans, ranging from host responses to cancer immunotherapy to metabolic disease and obesity. However, difficulty in accurate and high-throughput functional analysis of human gut microorganisms has hindered efforts to define mechanistic connections between individual microbial strains and host phenotypes. One key way in which the gut microbiome influences host physiology is through the production of small molecules(1-3), yet progress in elucidating this chemical interplay has been hindered by limited tools calibrated to detect the products of anaerobic biochemistry in the gut. Here we construct a microbiome-focused, integrated mass-spectrometry pipeline to accelerate the identification of microbiota-dependent metabolites in diverse sample types. We report the metabolic profiles of 178 gut microorganism strains using our library of 833 metabolites. Using this metabolomics resource, we establish deviations in the relationships between phylogeny and metabolism, use machine learning to discover a previously undescribed type of metabolism in Bacteroides, and reveal candidate biochemical pathways using comparative genomics. Microbiota-dependent metabolites can be detected in diverse biological fluids from gnotobiotic and conventionally colonized mice and traced back to the corresponding metabolomic profiles of cultured bacteria.

J	Speiser, JL; Miller, ME; Tooze, J; Ip, E				Speiser, Jaime Lynn; Miller, Michael E.; Tooze, Janet; Ip, Edward			A comparison of random forest variable selection methods for classification prediction modeling	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Random forest; Variable selection; Feature reduction; Classification		Random forest classification is a popular machine learning method for developing prediction models in many research settings. Often in prediction modeling, a goal is to reduce the number of variables needed to obtain a prediction in order to reduce the burden of data collection and improve efficiency. Several variable selection methods exist for the setting of random forest classification; however, there is a paucity of literature to guide users as to which method may be preferable for different types of datasets. Using 311 classification datasets freely available online, we evaluate the prediction error rates, number of variables, computation times and area under the receiver operating curve for many random forest variable selection methods. We compare random forest variable selection methods for different types of datasets (datasets with binary outcomes, datasets with many predictors, and datasets with imbalanced outcomes) and for different types of methods (standard random forest versus conditional random forest methods and test based versus performance based methods). Based on our study, the best variable selection methods for most datasets are Jiang's method and the method implemented in the VSURF R package. For datasets with many predictors, the methods implemented in the R packages varSelRF and Boruta are preferable due to computational efficiency. A significant contribution of this study is the ability to assess different variable selection techniques in the setting of random forest classification in order to identify preferable methods based on applications in expert and intelligent systems.

Rubesh; Bhaskar, Vidhyacharan			Big data analytics for disaster response and recovery through sentiment analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Big data; Disaster management; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Social media analysis	SOCIAL MEDIA; TWITTER; SUPPORT; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Big data created by social media and mobile networks provide an exceptional opportunity to mine valuable insights from them. This information is harnessed by business entities to measure the level of customer satisfaction but its application in disaster response is still in its inflection point. Social networks are increasingly used for emergency communications and help related requests. During disaster situations, such emergency requests need to be mined from the pool of big data for providing timely help. Though government organizations and emergency responders work together through their respective national disaster response framework, the sentiment of the affected people during and after the disaster determines the success of the disaster response and recovery process. In this paper, we propose a big data driven approach for disaster response through sentiment analysis. The proposed model collects disaster data from social networks and categorize them according to the needs of the affected people. The categorized disaster data are classified through machine learning algorithm for analyzing the sentiment of the people. Various features like, parts of speech and lexicon are analyzed to identify the best classification strategy for disaster data. The results show that lexicon based approach is suitable for analyzing the needs of the people during disaster. The practical implication of the proposed methodology is the real- time categorization and classification of social media big data for disaster response and recovery. This analysis helps the emergency responders and rescue personnel to develop better strategies for effective information management of the rapidly changing disaster environment.	[Ragini, J.

We aimed to explore whether motor activity alone, as assessed by longitudinal actigraphy, can be used to classify accurately BD patients and healthy controls (HCs) into their respective groups. Methods Ninety-day actigraphy records from 25 interepisode BD patients (ie, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) < 15) and 25 sex- and age-matched HCs were used in order to identify latent actigraphic biomarkers capable of discriminating between BD patients and HCs. Mean values and time variations of a set of standard actigraphy features were analyzed and further validated using the random forest classifier. Results Using all actigraphy features, this method correctly assigned 88% (sensitivity = 85%, specificity = 91%) of BD patients and HCs to their respective group. The classification success may be confounded by differences in employment between BD patients and HCs. When motor activity features resistant to the employment status were used (the strongest feature being time variation of intradaily variability, Cohen's d = 1.33), 79% of the subjects (sensitivity = 76%, specificity = 81%) were correctly classified. Conclusion A machine-learning actigraphy-based model was capable of distinguishing between interepisode BD patients and HCs solely on the basis of motor activity. The classification remained valid even when features influenced by employment status were omitted. The findings suggest that temporal variability of actigraphic parameters may provide discriminative power for differentiating between BD patients and HCs while being less affected by employment status.

COVID-19 lockdowns highlight a risk of increasing ozone pollution in European urban areas	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							METEOROLOGICAL NORMALIZATION; NO2; EMISSIONS	In March 2020, non-pharmaceutical intervention measures in the form of lockdowns were applied across Europe to urgently reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes the COVID-19 disease. The aggressive curtailing of the European economy had widespread impacts on the atmospheric composition, particularly for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3). To investigate these changes, we analyse data from 246 ambient air pollution monitoring sites in 102 urban areas and 34 countries in Europe between February and July 2020. Counterfactual, business-as-usual air quality time series are created using machine-learning models to account for natural weather variability. Across Europe, we estimate that NO2 concentrations were 34% and 32% lower than expected for respective traffic and urban background locations, whereas O-3 was 30% and 21% higher (in the same respective environments) at the point of maximum restriction on mobility. To put the 2020 changes into context, average NO2 trends since 2010 were calculated, and the changes experienced across European urban areas in 2020 was equivalent to 7.6 years of average NO2 reduction (or concentrations which might be anticipated in 2028). Despite NO2 concentrations decreasing by approximately a third, total oxidant (O-x) changed little, suggesting that the reductions in NO2 were substituted by increases in O-3. The lockdown period demonstrated that the expected future reductions in NO2 in European urban areas are likely to lead to widespread increases in urban O-3 pollution unless additional mitigation measures are introduced.

In this study, we first present a comprehensive description of the trace element behaviour of apatite in various kinds of bedrocks (igneous rocks from felsic through to ultramafic compositions, metamorphic rocks from low to high grades and of diverse protolith composition, and authigenic apatite) in which we explain why apatite is so highly diverse in terms of its trace element composition. Next, we present a synthesis of bedrock apatite trace-element compositional data from previous work, assembling a library of apatite compositions that includes the most abundant apatite-bearing lithologies in the Earth's crust, and many other less abundant rock types. Compositional statistics, classification, and a machine learning classifier are then applied to this dataset to generate biplots that can be used to determine the broad source lithology of detrital apatite, with misclassification averaging 15%. This methodology is tested in three case studies to demonstrate its utility. In these examples, detrital apatite can be convincingly linked to different lithology types, and combined apatite trace-element and U-Pb data can determine the terranes from which individual apatites were likely derived. The addition of apatite trace-element information therefore enables the determination of the source lithology, making the extraction of novel information and more specific provenance determinations possible, and opening up new avenues in source-to-sink modelling.

If new reactions can be considered unpredictable using current chemical knowledge, then we suggest that they are not merely new but also novel. Such a classification, however, requires an expert judge to have access to all current chemical knowledge or risks a lack of information being interpreted as unpredictability. Here, we describe how searching chemical space using automation and algorithms improves the probability of discovery. The former enables routine chemical tasks to be performed more quickly and consistently, while the latter uses algorithms to facilitate the searching of chemical knowledge databases. Experimental systems can also be developed to discover novel molecules, reactions and mechanisms by augmenting the intuition of the human expert. In order to find new chemical laws, we must seek to question current assumptions and biases. Accomplishing that involves using two areas of algorithmic approaches: algorithms to perform searches, and more general machine learning and statistical modelling algorithms to predict the chemistry under investigation. We propose that such a chemical intelligence approach is already being used and that, in the not-too-distant future, the automated chemical reactor systems controlled by these algorithms and monitored by a sensor array will be capable of navigating and searching chemical space more quickly, efficiently and, importantly, without bias. This approach promises to yield not only new molecules but also unpredictable and thus novel reactivity.

Like with all claims databases, there have been some validity concerns of studies using the NHIRD, such as the accuracy of diagnosis codes and issues around unmeasured confounders. Endeavors to validate diagnosed codes or to develop methodologic approaches to address unmeasured confounders have largely increased the reliability of NHIRD studies. Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) established a Health and Welfare Data Center (HWDC), a data repository site that centralizes the NHIRD and about 70 other health-related databases for data management and analyses. To strengthen the protection of data privacy, investigators are required to conduct on-site analysis at an HWDC through remote connection to MOHW servers. Although the tight regulation of this on-site analysis has led to inconvenience for analysts and has increased time and costs required for research, the HWDC has created opportunities for enriched dimensions of study by linking across the NHIRD and other databases. In the near future, researchers will have greater opportunity to distill knowledge from the NHIRD linked to hospital-based electronic medical records databases containing unstructured patient-level information by using artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning and natural language processes. We believe that NHIRD with multiple data sources could represent a powerful research engine with enriched dimensions and could serve as a guiding light for real-world evidence-based medicine in Taiwan.

The dataset comprising crash and non-crash events are extremely imbalanced. For instance, the dataset used in this paper consists of only 625 crash events for over 6.5 million non-crash events. Thus, learning algorithms tend to perform poorly on these datasets. We have used variational autoencoder to encode all the events into a latent space. After training, the model could successfully separate crash and non-crash events. To generate data, we sampled from the latent space containing crash data. The generated data was compared with the real data from different statistical aspects. t-Test, Levene-test and Kolmogrove Smirnov test showed that the generated data was statistically similar to the real data. It was also compared to some of the minority oversampling techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN as well as the GAN framework for generating data. Crash prediction models based on Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used to compare the generated data from the different oversampling techniques. Overall, variational autoencoder (VAE) showed excellent results compared to the other data augmentation methods. Specificity is improved by 8% and 4% for VAE-LR and VAE-SVM respectively when compared to SMOTE while the sensitivity is improved by 6% and 5% when compared to ADASYN. Moreover, VAE generated data also helps to overcome the overfitting problem in SMOTE and ADASYN since there is flexibility in choosing the decision boundary.

Motivated by this exciting experimental advance, herein we conduct extensive first-principles based simulations to explore the stability, mechanical properties, lattice thermal conductivity, piezoelectric and flexoelectric response, and photocatalytic and electronic features of MA(2)Z(4) (M = Cr, Mo, W; A = Si, Ge; Z = N, P) monolayers. The considered nanosheets are found to exhibit dynamical stability and remarkably high mechanical properties. Moreover, they show diverse electronic properties from antiferromagnetic metal to half metal and to semiconductors with band gaps ranging from 0.31 to 2.57 eV. Among the studied nanosheets, the MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayers yield appropriate band edge positions, high electron and hole mobilities, and strong visible light absorption, highly promising for applications in optoelectronics and photocatalytic water splitting. The MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayers are also predicted to show outstandingly high lattice thermal conductivity of 440 and 500 W/mK, respectively. For the first time we show that machine learning interatomic potentials trained over small supercells can be employed to examine the flexoelectric and piezoelectric properties of complex structures. As the most exciting finding, WSi2N4, CrSi2N4 and MoSi2N4 are found to exhibit the highest piezoelectric coefficients, outperforming all other-known 2D materials. Our results highlight that MA(2)Z(4) nanosheets not only undoubtedly outperform the transition metal dichalcogenides family but also can compete with graphene for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronic, energy storage/conversion and thermal management systems.

J	Unke, OT; Meuwly, M				Unke, Oliver T.; Meuwly, Markus			PhysNet: A Neural Network for Predicting Energies, Forces, Dipole Moments, and Partial Charges	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL THEORY AND COMPUTATION			English	Article							GAS-PHASE S(N)2; DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; DECOMPOSITION SCHEME; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; MODEL; QUALITY; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; SURFACES	In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in computational chemistry. After being trained on appropriate ab initio reference data, these methods allow for accurately predicting the properties of chemical systems, circumventing the need for explicitly solving the electronic Schrodinger equation. Because of their computational efficiency and scalability to large data sets, deep neural networks (DNNs) are a particularly promising ML algorithm for chemical applications. This work introduces PhysNet, a DNN architecture designed for predicting energies, forces, and dipole moments of chemical systems. PhysNet achieves stateof-the-art performance on the QM9, MD17, and ISO17 benchmarks. Further, two new data sets are generated in order to probe the performance of ML models for describing chemical reactions, long-range interactions, and condensed phase systems. It is shown that explicitly including electrostatics in energy predictions is crucial for a qualitatively correct description of the asymptotic regions of a potential energy surface (PES). PhysNet models trained on a systematically constructed set of small peptide fragments (at most eight heavy atoms) are able to generalize to considerably larger proteins like deca-alanine (Ala(10)): The optimized geometry of helical Ala10 predicted by PhysNet is virtually identical to ab initio results (RMSD = 0.21 A). By running unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ala(10) on the PhysNet-PES in gas phase, it is found that instead of a helical structure, Ala(10) folds into a "wreath-shaped" configuration, which is more stable than the helical form by 0.46 kcal mol(-1) according to the reference ab initio calculations.

Thus, an assessment of the field is timely to clarify priorities and accelerate progress. Here, we highlight the successes to date but, more importantly, identify gaps and unmet needs, both experimentally and clinically. These include the need to better define cell-cell interactions and etiology-specific elements of fibrogenesis and their link to disease-specific drivers of portal hypertension. Success in treating viral hepatitis has revealed the remarkable capacity of the liver to degrade scar in reversing fibrosis, yet we know little of the mechanisms underlying this response. Thus, there is an exigent need to clarify the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis regression in order for therapeutics to mimic the liver's endogenous capacity. Better refined and more predictive in vitro and animal models will hasten drug development. From a clinical perspective, current diagnostics are improving but not always biologically plausible or sufficiently accurate to supplant biopsy. More urgently, digital pathology methods that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence must be validated in order to capture more prognostic information from liver biopsies and better quantify the response to therapies. For more refined treatment of NASH, orthogonal approaches that integrate genetic, clinical, and pathological data sets may yield treatments for specific subphenotypes of the disease. Collectively, these and other advances will strengthen and streamline clinical trials and better link histologic responses to clinical outcomes.

To tackle this issue, this study presents a deep twin convolutional neural networks with multi-domain inputs (DTCNNMI) for diesel engine misfire diagnosis under strong environmental noise and different working conditions. Vibration signals of engine cylinder heads at different speeds are collected experimentally and fed into input layers of the proposed model. It constructs three input layers to combine automatically extracted time-domain, time-frequency-domain and handcraft time-domain statistical features, improving the model performance. Twin convolutional neural networks with large first-layer kernels are presented for extracting multi-domain information of vibration signals and resist influence of environmental noise and the change of operating conditions on the final diagnosis results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on the datasets collected experimentally and by making comparison with the existing representative algorithms. The results demonstrate that the accuracy and anti-noise performance of the proposed DTCNNMI outperforms the existing algorithms. On the constructed four datasets under different working conditions, the proposed method achieved at least 97.019% accuracy even when signalto-noise ratio was -4 dB, which is much higher than those of the other methods. Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed DTCNNMI on datasets A, B, C and D is at least 61.177%, 33.334%, 17.646% and 29.961% higher than other methods, respectively.

Fasting alters the gut microbiome reducing blood pressure and body weight in metabolic syndrome patients	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							VEGETARIAN DIET; T-CELLS; OBESE; ASSOCIATION; GENE; VISUALIZATION; PREVENTION; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; PATTERNS	Periods of fasting and refeeding may reduce cardiometabolic risk elevated by Western diet. Here we show in the substudy of NCT02099968, investigating the clinical parameters, the immunome and gut microbiome exploratory endpoints, that in hypertensive metabolic syndrome patients, a 5-day fast followed by a modified Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet reduces systolic blood pressure, need for antihypertensive medications, body-mass index at three months post intervention compared to a modified Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet alone. Fasting alters the gut microbiome, impacting bacterial taxa and gene modules associated with short-chain fatty acid production. Cross-system analyses reveal a positive correlation of circulating mucosa-associated invariant T cells, non-classical monocytes and CD4(+) effector T cells with systolic blood pressure. Furthermore, regulatory T cells positively correlate with body-mass index and weight. Machine learning analysis of baseline immunome or microbiome data predicts sustained systolic blood pressure response within the fasting group, identifying CD8(+) effector T cells, Th17 cells and regulatory T cells or Desulfovibrionaceae, Hydrogenoanaerobacterium, Akkermansia, and Ruminococcaceae as important contributors to the model. Here we report that the high-resolution multi-omics data highlight fasting as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for the treatment of high blood pressure in metabolic syndrome patients. Nutritional modification including fasting has been shown to reduce cardiometabolic risk linked to western diet. Here the authors show implementation of fasting resulted in alterations to the intestinal microbiota, and circulating immune cells, improving blood pressure and body weight in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which neuroinflammation has a critical function(1). However, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive immune response in Alzheimer's disease(2). Here, using integrated analyses of multiple cohorts, we identify peripheral and central adaptive immune changes in Alzheimer's disease. First, we performed mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and discovered an immune signature of Alzheimer's disease that consists of increased numbers of CD8(+) T effector memory CD45RA(+) (T-EMRA) cells. In a second cohort, we found that CD8(+) T-EMRA cells were negatively associated with cognition. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that T cell receptor (TCR) signalling was enhanced in these cells. Notably, by using several strategies of single-cell TCR sequencing in a third cohort, we discovered clonally expanded CD8(+) T-EMRA cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we used machine learning, cloning and peptide screens to demonstrate the specificity of clonally expanded TCRs in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease to two separate Epstein-Barr virus antigens. These results reveal an adaptive immune response in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease and provide evidence of clonal, antigen-experienced T cells patrolling the intrathecal space of brains affected by age-related neurodegeneration.

EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social networks; Twitter; Survey; Social graph; Sentiment analysis; Spam; Bots; Fake news; Hate speech	SOCIAL MEDIA; SMALL-WORLD; NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK; TWEETS; ONLINE; TOOL; BOT	Twitter is the third most popular worldwide Online Social Network (OSN) after Facebook and Instagram. Compared to other OSNs, it has a simple data model and a straightforward data access API. This makes it ideal for social network studies attempting to analyze the patterns of online behavior, the structure of the social graph, the sentiment towards various entities and the nature of malicious attacks in a vivid network with hundreds of millions of users. Indeed, Twitter has been established as a major research platform, utilized in more than ten thousands research articles over the last ten years. Although there are excellent review and comparison studies for most of the research that utilizes Twitter, there are limited efforts to map this research terrain as a whole. Here we present an effort to map the current research topics in Twitter focusing on three major areas: the structure and properties of the social graph, sentiment analysis and threats such as spam, bots, fake news and hate speech. We also present Twitter's basic data model and best practices for sampling and data access. This survey also lays the ground of computational techniques used in these areas such as Graph Sampling, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Along with existing reviews and comparison studies, we also discuss the key findings and the state of the art in these methods. Overall, we hope that this survey will help researchers create a clear conceptual model of Twitter and act as a guide to expand further the topics presented.

This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the 14th from SDSS overall (making this Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes the data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (2014-2016 July) public. Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey; the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data-driven machine-learning algorithm known as "The Cannon"; and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from the SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS web site (www.sdss.org) has been updated for this release and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020 and will be followed by SDSS-V.

J	Lillford, P; Hermansson, AM				Lillford, Peter; Hermansson, Anne-Marie			Global missions and the critical needs of food science and technology	TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Novel raw materials; Process and Systems engineering; Waste reduction; Safety and Traceability; Digital technologies; &quot; Hidden hunger&quot	NUTRITION; CHALLENGES; HEALTH	Background: Achievement of many Sustainable Development Goals has a critical reliance on the food chain at both a global and local level. The future contribution of the biological sciences to agriculture and human health has been widely recognised, but the enabling science and engineering underpinning food manufacturing and distribution has not been so thoroughly examined. Scope and approach: The challenges confronting Food Science and Technology are considered from a global perspective and routes to their solutions are expressed as Mission Statements requiring multidisciplinary collaboration. These encompass the introduction of novel raw materials; changes in Manufacturing, including process and systems engineering; waste reduction and product safety and traceability. Approaches to better health via improved diets are presented, including ?Hidden Hunger? and affordable foods for the poor as well as the increasing role of advanced digital technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Key findings and conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that FS&T is a crucial knowledge base that will allow advances in Primary Production to be sustainably converted to better control of Health through Diet. The missions involve new greater interdisciplinary collaboration, and require development of new measurement science. The need for continuing investment in food science and technology is global, but its application will require different approaches in local regions. It is vital that continuous education and training is increased by both public and private sector investment. Consumers must also be engaged to increase their awareness of new technologies and their consequent benefits to food supply and healthier diets.

The RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD)	RADIOLOGY			English	Article								The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health care emergency. Although reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiography and CT play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated data set has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multinational, expert-annotated COVID-19 imaging data set. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations was performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID-19-positive thoracic CT scans. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID-19 data annotation efforts, the European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics, the American College of Radiology, and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Study-level COVID-19 classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists, with majority vote adjudication by board-certified radiologists. RICORD consists of 240 thoracic CT scans and 1000 chest radiographs contributed from four international sites. It is anticipated that RICORD will ideally lead to prediction models that can demonstrate sustained performance across populations and health care systems.

Integrated photonic networks are particularly powerful in performing analog computing of matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) as they afford unparalleled speed and bandwidth density for data transmission. Incorporating nonvolatile phase-change materials in integrated photonic devices enables indispensable programming and in-memory computing capabilities for on-chip optical computing. Here, we demonstrate a multimode photonic computing core consisting of an array of programable mode converters based on on-waveguide metasurfaces made of phase-change materials. The programmable converters utilize the refractive index change of the phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5 during phase transition to control the waveguide spatial modes with a very high precision of up to 64 levels in modal contrast. This contrast is used to represent the matrix elements, with 6-bit resolution and both positive and negative values, to perform MVM computation in neural network algorithms. We demonstrate a prototypical optical convolutional neural network that can perform image processing and recognition tasks with high accuracy. With a broad operation bandwidth and a compact device footprint, the demonstrated multimode photonic core is promising toward large-scale photonic neural networks with ultrahigh computation throughputs. Integrated optical computing requires programmable photonic and nonlinear elements. The authors demonstrate a phase-change metasurface mode converter, which can be programmed to control the waveguide mode contrast, and build an optical convolutional neural network to perform image processing tasks.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolution neural networks (CNN) are the current hotspots in the field of RUL prediction. However, the LSTM-based prognostic approach has a slow loop step to process large-scale time-series data since the dependence of the data processing process at each time on the output of the previous time limits parallelism, and the CNN-based prognostic approach is not fit for time-series data although it can process the data in parallel. In this article, a new autoencoder quasi-recurrent neural networks (AEQRNN) based prognostic approach is proposed for RUL prediction of the engineering systems. The AEQRNN contains convolution components that can process input data in parallel, and pooling components which has two LSTM-like gate structures to process time-series data. In addition, the AEQRNN can automatically extract hidden features from monitoring signals without manual feature design. The effectiveness of the proposed prognostic approach is validated by three prognostic benchmarking datasets, including a turbofan engine dataset, a rolling bearing dataset, and a machining tool dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach has both superior prognostic performance and training speed in comparison with other kinds of recurrent-neural-network-based approaches and various state-of-the-art approaches in the recent literature.

If there is no terminator in gene, transcription could not stop, which will result in abnormal gene expression. Detecting such terminators can determine the operon structure in bacterial organisms and improve genome annotation. Thus, accurate identification of transcriptional terminators is essential and extremely important in the research of transcription regulations. Results In this study, we developed a new predictor called iTerm-PseKNC' based on support vector machine to identify transcription terminators. The binomial distribution approach was used to pick out the optimal feature subset derived from pseudo k-tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC). The 5-fold cross-validation test results showed that our proposed method achieved an accuracy of 95%. To further evaluate the generalization ability of iTerm-PseKNC', the model was examined on independent datasets which are experimentally confirmed Rho-independent terminators in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis genomes. As a result, all the terminators in E. coli and 87.5% of the terminators in B. subtilis were correctly identified, suggesting that the proposed model could become a powerful tool for bacterial terminator recognition. Availability and implementation For the convenience of most of wet-experimental researchers, the web-server for iTerm-PseKNC' was established at http://lin-group.cn/server/iTerm-PseKNC/, by which users can easily obtain their desired result without the need to go through the detailed mathematical equations involved.

Recent cross-modal hashing methods often learn unified or equal-length hash codes to represent the multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable. However, such unified or equal-length hash representations could inherently sacrifice their representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not have one-to-one correspondence and could be encoded more efficiently by different hash codes of unequal lengths. To mitigate these problems, this paper exploits a related and relatively unexplored problem: encode the heterogeneous data with varying hash lengths and generalize the cross-modal retrieval in various challenging scenarios. To this end, a generalized and flexible cross-modal hashing framework, termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH), is proposed to work seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired multi-modal data, and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios. More specifically, MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to flexibly learn the modality-specific hash codes with different length settings, while synchronously learning two semantic correlation matrices to semantically correlate the different hash representations for heterogeneous data comparable. As a result, the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments evaluated on public benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of MTFH under various retrieval scenarios and show its competitive performance with the state-of-the-arts.

CryoDRGN: reconstruction of heterogeneous cryo-EM structures using neural networks	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							VISUALIZATION; MICROSCOPY	Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis has proven powerful in determining the structures of rigid macromolecules. However, many imaged protein complexes exhibit conformational and compositional heterogeneity that poses a major challenge to existing three-dimensional reconstruction methods. Here, we present cryoDRGN, an algorithm that leverages the representation power of deep neural networks to directly reconstruct continuous distributions of 3D density maps and map per-particle heterogeneity of single-particle cryo-EM datasets. Using cryoDRGN, we uncovered residual heterogeneity in high-resolution datasets of the 80S ribosome and the RAG complex, revealed a new structural state of the assembling 50S ribosome, and visualized large-scale continuous motions of a spliceosome complex. CryoDRGN contains interactive tools to visualize a dataset's distribution of per-particle variability, generate density maps for exploratory analysis, extract particle subsets for use with other tools and generate trajectories to visualize molecular motions.

Insulator defect detection is performed against complex backgrounds in aerial images, presenting an interesting but challenging problem. Traditional methods, based on handcrafted features or shallow-learning techniques, can only localize insulators and detect faults under specific detection conditions, such as when sufficient prior knowledge is available, with low background interference, at certain object scales, or under specific illumination conditions. This paper discusses the automatic detection of insulator defects using aerial images, accurately localizing insulator defects appearing in input images captured from real inspection environments. We propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) cascading architecture for performing localization and detecting defects in insulators. The cascading network uses a CNN based on a region proposal network to transform defect inspection into a two-level object detection problem. To address the scarcity of defect images in a real inspection environment, a data augmentation method is also proposed that includes four operations: 1) affine transformation; 2) insulator segmentation and background fusion; 3) Gaussian blur; and 4) brightness transformation. Defect detection precision and recall of the proposed method are 0.91 and 0.96 using a standard insulator dataset, and insulator defects under various conditions can be successfully detected. Experimental results demonstrate that this method meets the robustness and accuracy requirements for insulator defect detection.

The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (>80%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have pushed forward this field significantly. Existing methods which adopt specific layers of deep CNNs may fail to capture complex data structures caused by variations of scales and aspect ratios. In this paper, we propose an accurate edge detector using richer convolutional features (RCF). RCF encapsulates all convolutional features into more discriminative representation, which makes good usage of rich feature hierarchies, and is amenable to training via backpropagation. RCF fully exploits multiscale and multilevel information of objects to perform the image-to-image prediction holistically. Using VGG16 network, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on several available datasets. When evaluating on the well-known BSDS500 benchmark, we achieve ODS F-measure of 0.811 while retaining a fast speed (8 FPS). Besides, our fast version of RCF achieves ODS F-measure of 0.806 with 30 FPS. We also demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method by applying RCF edges for classical image segmentation.

In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL.

Most MOT methods employ two steps: Object Detection and Data Association. The first step detects objects of interest in every frame of a video, and the second establishes correspondence between the detected objects in different frames to obtain their tracks. Object detection has made tremendous progress in the last few years due to deep learning. However, data association for tracking still relies on hand crafted constraints such as appearance, motion, spatial proximity, grouping etc. to compute affinities between the objects in different frames. In this paper, we harness the power of deep learning for data association in tracking by jointly modeling object appearances and their affinities between different frames in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed Deep Affinity Network (DAN) learns compact, yet comprehensive features of pre-detected objects at several levels of abstraction, and performs exhaustive pairing permutations of those features in any two frames to infer object affinities. DAN also accounts for multiple objects appearing and disappearing between video frames. We exploit the resulting efficient affinity computations to associate objects in the current frame deep into the previous frames for reliable on-line tracking. Our technique is evaluated on popular multiple object tracking challenges MOT15, MOT17 and UA-DETRAC. Comprehensive benchmarking under twelve evaluation metrics demonstrates that our approach is among the best performing techniques on the leader board for these challenges.

A strategic framework for artificial intelligence in marketing	JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Mechanical AI; Thinking AI; Feeling AI; Strategic AI marketing; Marketing strategy; Standardization; Personalization; Relationalization; Segmentation; Targeting; Positioning; 4Ps; 4Cs	AUTOMATED TEXT ANALYSIS; SERVICE ROBOTS; CONSUMER; SEGMENTATION; INFORMATION; INTERNET; TRACKING; SCIENCE; THINGS; MUSIC	The authors develop a three-stage framework for strategic marketing planning, incorporating multiple artificial intelligence (AI) benefits: mechanical AI for automating repetitive marketing functions and activities, thinking AI for processing data to arrive at decisions, and feeling AI for analyzing interactions and human emotions. This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization. We apply this framework to various areas of marketing, organized by marketing 4Ps/4Cs, to illustrate the strategic use of AI.

A Data-Driven Method for Battery Charging Capacity Abnormality Diagnosis in Electric Vehicle Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION			English	Article						Batteries; Fault diagnosis; Predictive models; Big Data; Safety; Adaptation models; Data models; Abnormity diagnosis; big data; charging capacity; electric vehicles (EVs); machine learning	LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; NETWORK	Enabling charging capacity abnormality diagnosis is essential for ensuring battery operation safety in electric vehicle (EV) applications. In this article, a data-driven method is proposed for battery charging capacity diagnosis based on massive real-world EV operating data. Using the charging rate, temperature, state of charge, and accumulated driving mileage as the inputs, a tree-based prediction model is developed with a polynomial feature combination used for model training. A statistics-based method is then used to diagnose battery charging capacity abnormity by analyzing the error distribution of large sets of data. The proposed tree-based prediction model is compared with other state-of-the-art methods and is shown to have the highest prediction accuracy. The holistic diagnosis scheme is verified using unseen data.

J	Wang, X; Mao, DX; Li, XD				Wang, Xin; Mao, Dongxing; Li, Xiaodong			Bearing fault diagnosis based on vibro-acoustic data fusion and 1D-CNN network	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Bearing fault diagnosis; Multi-modal data fusion; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; TUNNEL BORING MACHINE; MODEL; EMD	Bearing fault diagnosis is an important part of rotating machinery maintenance. Existing diagnosis methods based on single-modal signals not only have unsatisfactory accuracy, but also bear the inherent risk of being misguided by single-modal signal noise. A new method is put forward that fuses multi-modal sensor signals, i.e. the data collected by an accelerometer and a microphone, to realize more accurate and robust bearing-fault diagnosis. The proposed method extracts features from raw vibration signals and acoustic signals, and fuses them using the 1D-CNN-based networks. Extensive experimental results obtained on ten groups of bearings are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. By analyzing the loss function and accuracy rate under different SNRs, it is empirically found that the proposed method achieves higher rate of diagnosis accuracy than the algorithms based on a single-modal sensor. Moreover, a visualization analysis is also conducted to investigate the inner mechanism of the proposed 1D-CNN-based method.

In this study, Sentinel-2 data were used for estimating the AGB in pure stands of Carpinus betulus (L., common hornbeam) located in the Hyrcanian forests, northern Iran. For this purpose, the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all trees thicker than 7.5 cm was measured in 55 square plots (45 x 45 m). In situ AGB was estimated using a local volume table and the specific density of wood. To estimate the AGB from remotely sensed data, parametric and nonparametric methods, including Multiple Regression (MR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Random Forest (RF), were applied to a single image of the Sentinel-2, having as a reference the estimations produced by in situ measurements and their corresponding spectral values of the original spectral (B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B8a, B11, and B12) and derived synthetic (IPVI, IRECI, GEMI, GNDVI, NDVI, DVI, PSSRA, and RVI) bands. Band 6 located in the red-edge region (0.740 nm) showed the highest correlation with AGB (r = -0.723). A comparison of the machine learning methods indicated that the ANN algorithm returned the best ABG-estimating performance (%RMSE = 19.9). This study demonstrates that simple vegetation indices extracted from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide good results in the AGB estimation of C. betulus trees of the Hyrcanian forests. The approach used in this study may be extended to similar areas located in temperate forests.

Here, we used machine-learning techniques with extensive peat core data (n > 7,000) to create observation-based maps of northern peatland C and N stocks, and to assess their response to warming and permafrost thaw. We estimate that northern peatlands cover 3.7 +/- 0.5 million km(2) and store 415 +/- 150 Pg C and 10 +/- 7 Pg N. Nearly half of the peatland area and peat C stocks are permafrost affected. Using modeled global warming stabilization scenarios (from 1.5 to 6 degrees C warming), we project that the current sink of atmospheric C (0.10 +/- 0.02 Pg C.y(-1)) in northern peatlands will shift to a C source as 0.8 to 1.9 million km 2 of permafrost-affected peatlands thaw. The projected thaw would cause peatland greenhouse gas emissions equal to similar to 1% of anthropogenic radiative forcing in this century. The main forcing is from methane emissions (0.7 to 3 Pg cumulative CH4-C) with smaller carbon dioxide forcing (1 to 2 Pg CO2-C) and minor nitrous oxide losses. We project that initial CO2-C losses reverse after similar to 200 y, as warming strengthens peatland C-sinks. We project substantial, but highly uncertain, additional losses of peat into fluvial systems of 10 to 30 Pg C and 0.4 to 0.9 Pg N. The combined gaseous and fluvial peatland C loss estimated here adds 30 to 50% onto previous estimates of permafrost-thaw C losses, with southern permafrost regions being the most vulnerable.

We obtained blood samples (n = 474) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 123), non-COVID-19 ICU sepsis patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 30). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in plasma or serum (RNAemia) of COVID-19 ICU patients when neutralizing antibody response was low. RNAemia is associated with higher 28-day ICU mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84 [95% CI, 1.22-2.77] adjusted for age and sex). RNAemia is comparable in performance to the best protein predictors. Mannose binding lectin 2 and pentraxin-3 (PTX3), two activators of the complement pathway of the innate immune system, are positively associated with mortality. Machine learning identified 'Age, RNAemia' and 'Age, PTX3' as the best binary signatures associated with 28-day ICU mortality. In longitudinal comparisons, COVID-19 ICU patients have a distinct proteomic trajectory associated with mortality, with recovery of many liver-derived proteins indicating survival. Finally, proteins of the complement system and galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP) are identified as interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. LGALS3BP overexpression inhibits spike-pseudoparticle uptake and spike-induced cell-cell fusion in vitro. Here the authors use RT-qPCR and mass spectrometry to analyze longitudinal blood samples from intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients and controls. They find that viral RNA and pentraxin-3 predict 28-day ICU mortality and that galectin-3-binding protein is an interaction partner of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with antiviral properties.

The models and the ensemble mean were assessed based on the ability to reproduce the annual climatology, seasonal rainfall distribution and trend. Statistical metrics used include mean bias error, normalized root mean square error, and pattern correlation coefficient. The Taylor diagram and Taylor skill score (TSS) were used in ranking the models. The models' performance varies greatly from one season to the other. The models reproduced the observed bimodal rainfall pattern of March to May (MAM) and September to November (SON) occurring over the region. Some models slightly overestimated, while some slightly underestimated, the MAM rainfall. However, there was a high rainfall overestimation during SON by most models. The models showed a positive spatial correlation with observed dataset, whereas a low correlation was shown inter-annually. Some models could not capture the rainfall patterns around local-scale features, for example, around the Lake Victoria basin and mountainous areas. The best performing models identified in the study include GFDL-ESM4, CanESM5, CESM2-WACCM, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-LM, UKESM1-0-LL, and CNRM-CM6-1. The models CNRM-CM6-1, and CNRM-ESM2 underestimated rainfall throughout the annual cycle and mean climatology. However, these two models better reproduced the spatial trends of rainfall during both MAM and SON. Caution should be taken when employing the models in seasonal climate change studies as their performance varies from one season to another. The model spread in CMIP6 over the study area also calls for further investigation on the attributions and possible implementation of robust approaches of machine learning to minimize the biases.

A deep CNN architecture has been proposed in this paper for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on the chest X-ray image classification. Due to the nonavailability of sufficient-size and good-quality chest X-ray image dataset, an effective and accurate CNN classification was a challenge. To deal with these complexities such as the availability of a very-small-sized and imbalanced dataset with image-quality issues, the dataset has been preprocessed in different phases using different techniques to achieve an effective training dataset for the proposed CNN model to attain its best performance. The preprocessing stages of the datasets performed in this study include dataset balancing, medical experts' image analysis, and data augmentation. The experimental results have shown the overall accuracy as high as 99.5% which demonstrates the good capability of the proposed CNN model in the current application domain. The CNN model has been tested in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the model has been tested using the 100 X-ray images of the original processed dataset which achieved an accuracy of 100%. In the second scenario, the model has been tested using an independent dataset of COVID-19 X-ray images. The performance in this test scenario was as high as 99.5%. To further prove that the proposed model outperforms other models, a comparative analysis has been done with some of the machine learning algorithms. The proposed model has outperformed all the models generally and specifically when the model testing was done using an independent testing set.

The implementation of non-contact, highly-efficient, and affordable methods for detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests over vast areas could greatly facilitate plant protection. In this respect, different forms of remote sensing methods have been introduced for detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests in many ways. This review outlines the state-of-the-art research achievements in relation to sensing technologies, feature extraction, and monitoring algorithms that have been conducted at multiple scales. Based on their characteristics and maturity in detecting and monitoring plant diseases and pests, sensing systems are classified into groups that include: visible & near infrared spectral sensors (VIS-NIR); fluorescence and thermal sensors; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging (Lidar) systems. Based on the data acquired from these remote sensing systems and sensitivity analysis, a variety of remote sensing features are proposed and identified as surrogates in the detection and monitoring processes. They include (1) optical, fluorescence, and thermal parameters; (2) image based landscape features; and (3) features associated with habitat suitability. We also review the algorithms that link the remote sensing features with the occurrence of plant diseases and pests for identifying, differentiating and determining severity of diseases and pests over large areas. The algorithms including statistical discriminant analyses, machine learning algorithms, regression-based models and spectral unmixing algorithms using data collected at a single time or multiple times. Finally, according to the review, we provide a general framework to facilitate the monitoring of an unknown disease or pest highlighting future challenges and trends.

Understanding public perception of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing on Twitter	INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article								Objective: Social distancing policies are key in curtailing severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread, but their effectiveness is heavily contingent on public understanding and collective adherence. We studied public perception of social distancing through organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter. Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we retrieved English-only tweets matching two trending social distancing hashtags, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We analyzed the tweets using natural language processing and machine-learning models, and we conducted a sentiment analysis to identify emotions and polarity. We evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and associated sentiments. Results: We studied a sample of 574,903 tweets. For both hashtags, polarity was positive (mean, 0.148; SD, 0.290); only 15% of tweets had negative polarity. Tweets were more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0-0.6) with similar to 30% of tweets labeled as completely objective (labeled as 0 in range from 0 to 1). Approximately half of tweets (50.4%) primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise. Each correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure and community support (ie, joy), concerns about food insecurity and quarantine effects (ie, fear), and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications (ie, surprise). Conclusions: Considering the positive sentiment, preponderance of objective tweets, and topics supporting coping mechanisms, we concluded that Twitter users generally supported social distancing in the early stages of their implementation.

The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission operated by the European Space Agency provides the opportunity to monitor Earth's surface using radar at high spatial and temporal resolution. Sentinel-1's Synthetic Aperture Radar provides co- and cross-polarized backscatter, enabling the calculation of microwave indices. In this study, we assess the potential of Sentinel-1 VV and VH backscatter and their ratio VH/VV, the cross ratio (CR), to monitor crop conditions. A quantitative assessment is provided based on in situ reference data of vegetation variables for different crops under varying meteorological conditions. Vegetation Water Content (VWC), biomass, Leaf Area Index (LAI) and height are measured in situ for oilseed-rape, corn and winter cereals at different fields during two growing seasons. To quantify the sensitivity of backscatter and microwave indices to vegetation dynamics, linear and exponential models and machine learning methods have been applied to the Sentinel-1 data and in situ measurements. Using an exponential model, the CR can account for 87% and 63% of the variability in VWC for corn and winter cereals. In oilseed-rape, the coefficient of determination (R-2) is lower (R-2 = 0.34) due to the large difference in VWC between the two growing seasons and changes in vegetation structure that affect backscatter. Findings from the Random Forest analysis, which uses backscatter, microwave indices and soil moisture as input variables, show that CR is by and large the most important variable to estimate VWC. This study demonstrates, based on a quantitative analysis, the large potential of microwave indices for vegetation monitoring of VWC and phenology.

Scott			Lung transplantation for patients with severe COVID-19	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE-OXYGENATION; THERAPEUTIC ANTICOAGULATION; PULMONARY-FIBROSIS	Lung transplantation can potentially be a life-saving treatment for patients with nonresolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. Concerns limiting lung transplantation include recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the allograft, technical challenges imposed by viral-mediated injury to the native lung, and the potential risk for allograft infection by pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in the native lung. Additionally, the native lung might recover, resulting in long-term outcomes preferable to those of transplant. Here, we report the results of lung transplantation in three patients with nonresolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. We performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to detect both positive and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in explanted lung tissue from the three patients and in additional control lung tissue samples. We conducted extracellular matrix imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing on explanted lung tissue from the three patients who underwent transplantation and on warm postmortem lung biopsies from two patients who had died from COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Lungs from these five patients with prolonged COVID-19 disease were free of SARS-CoV-2 as detected by smFISH, but pathology showed extensive evidence of injury and fibrosis that resembled end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Using machine learning, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing data from the lungs of patients with late-stage COVID-19 to that from the lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and identified similarities in gene expression across cell lineages. Our findings suggest that some patients with severe COVID-19 develop fibrotic lung disease for which lung transplantation is their only option for survival.

Characterising JUUL-related posts on Instagram	TOBACCO CONTROL			English	Article						electronic nicotine delivery devices; public policy; advertising and promotion; media; addiction	SOCIAL MEDIA; EXPOSURE; TOBACCO; STUDENTS	Background JUUL, a high-tech, popular vaping device, was the first major electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) brand to incorporate social media into its marketing strategy. There is growing concern around the increasing use of JUUL and other electronic nicotine delivery devices among youth, and their potential to addict a new generation to nicotine. The current study analysed the amount and characteristics of JUUL-related posts on Instagram, a social media platform used frequently among youth and young adults. Methods Hashtag-based keyword queries (n=50) were used to collect JUUL-related posts from the Instagram application programming interface, March 2018-May 2018. Using a combination of machine learning methods, keyword algorithms and human coding, posts were characterised as featuring content related to product promotion, nicotine and addiction, youth culture and lifestyle. Results Keyword queries captured 14 838 JUUL-relevant posts by 5201 unique users. Over one-third of posts were promotional (eg, linked to commercial website) and 11% contained nicotine and addiction-related information. Approximately half of posts featured content related to youth (55%) or lifestyle (57%). Youth-related content or lifestyle appeals were also notably present within promotional posts and nicotine and addiction-related posts, respectively. Nicotine and addiction-related posts featured memes, hashtags (eg, #nichead, #juulbuzz) and tag lines (eg, 'more flavor, more buzz'). Conclusions Findings reveal a proliferation of JUUL-related content on Instagram, which focused on product promotion and nicotine and addiction that included youth culture and lifestyle appeals. Regulatory actions should focus on restricting promotional efforts for e-cigarette products, particularly on social media platforms where young people are a primary audience.

A recent machine learning method enables us to estimate an individual's "brain-age" from MRI; this brain-age prediction is expected as a novel individual biomarker of neuropsychiatric disorders. The aims of this study were to estimate the brain-age for various categories of epilepsy and to evaluate clinical discrimination by brain-age for (1) the effect of psychosis on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), (2) psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) from MRI-negative epilepsies, and (3) progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) from juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). In total, 1196 T1-weighted MRI scans from healthy controls (HCs) were used to build a brain-age prediction model with support vector regression. Using the model, we calculated the brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD: predicted age-chronological age) of the HCs and 318 patients with epilepsy. We compared the brain-PAD values based on the research questions. As a result, all categories of patients except for extra-temporal lobe focal epilepsy showed a significant increase in brain-PAD. TLE with hippocampal sclerosis presented a significantly higher brain-PAD than several other categories. The mean brain-PAD in TLE with inter-ictal psychosis was 10.9 years, which was significantly higher than TLE without psychosis (5.3 years). PNES showed a comparable mean brain-PAD (10.6 years) to that of epilepsy patients. PME had a higher brain-PAD than JME (22.0 vs. 9.3 years). In conclusion, neuroimaging-based brain-age prediction can provide novel insight into or clinical usefulness for the diverse symptoms of epilepsy.

For one of the most diverse and species-rich groups, the squamate reptiles (lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians), an inverse correlation between the number of taxa and loci sampled still persists across all publications using DNA sequence data and reaching a consensus on the relationships among them has been highly problematic. In this study, we use high-throughput sequence data from 289 samples covering 75 families of squamates to address phylogenetic affinities, estimate divergence times, and characterize residual topological uncertainty in the presence of genome-scale data. Importantly, we address genomic support for the traditional taxonomic groupings Scleroglossa and Macrostomata using novel machine-learning techniques. We interrogate genes using various metrics inherent to these loci, including parsimony-informative sites (PIS), phylogenetic informativeness, length, gaps, number of substitutions, and site concordance to understand why certain loci fail to find previously well-supported molecular clades and how they fail to support species-tree estimates. We show that both incomplete lineage sorting and poor gene-tree estimation (due to a few undesirable gene properties, such as an insufficient number of PIS), may account for most gene and species-tree discordance. We find overwhelming signal for Toxicofera, and also show that none of the loci included in this study supports Scleroglossa or Macrostomata. We comment on the origins and diversification of Squamata throughout the Mesozoic and underscore remaining uncertainties that persist in both deeper parts of the tree (e.g., relationships between Dibamia, Gekkota, and remaining squamates; among the three toxicoferan clades Iguania, Serpentes, and Anguiformes) and within specific clades (e.g., affinities among gekkotan, pleurodont iguanians, and colubroid families).

The Pretreatment Gut Microbiome Is Associated With Lack of Response to Methotrexate in New-Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis	ARTHRITIS & RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article							MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGS; SUBCUTANEOUS METHOTREXATE; EULAR RECOMMENDATIONS; CLINICAL-EFFICACY; BIOLOGIC THERAPY; MONOTHERAPY; CELLS; POLYMORPHISMS; METABOLISM; MANAGEMENT	Objective Although oral methotrexate (MTX) remains the anchor drug for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), up to 50% of patients do not achieve a clinically adequate outcome. In addition, there is a lack of prognostic tools for treatment response prior to drug initiation. This study was undertaken to investigate whether interindividual differences in the human gut microbiome can aid in the prediction of MTX efficacy in new-onset RA. Methods We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing on the baseline gut microbiomes of drug-naive patients with new-onset RA (n = 26). Results were validated in an additional independent cohort (n = 21). To gain insight into potential microbial mechanisms, we conducted ex vivo experiments coupled with metabolomics analysis to evaluate the association between microbiome-driven MTX depletion and clinical response. Results Our analysis revealed significant associations of the abundance of gut bacterial taxa and their genes with future clinical response (q < 0.05), including orthologs related to purine and MTX metabolism. Machine learning techniques were applied to the metagenomic data, resulting in a microbiome-based model that predicted lack of response to MTX in an independent group of patients. Finally, MTX levels remaining after ex vivo incubation with distal gut samples from pretreatment RA patients significantly correlated with the magnitude of future clinical response, suggesting a possible direct effect of the gut microbiome on MTX metabolism and treatment outcomes. Conclusion Taken together, these findings are the first step toward predicting lack of response to oral MTX in patients with new-onset RA and support the value of the gut microbiome as a possible prognostic tool and as a potential target in RA therapeutics.

J	Sharma, V; Mir, RN				Sharma, Vipul; Mir, Roohie Naaz			An enhanced time efficient technique for image watermarking using ant colony optimization and light gradient boosting algorithm	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Image watermarking; Ant colony optimization; Light gradient boosting algorithm; Fitness function; Time enhancement	SCHEME; TRANSFORM	For a secure multimedia data exchange, watermarking is used. Generally, meta-heuristic optimization is required to optimize scheme parameters in the watermarking embedding. Even though meta-heuristic methods have been widely used because of their enhancing capability, due to their large time consump-tion nature they are not applicable for time-sensitive applications. This paper proposes a time efficient optimization method based on machine learning algorithms to detect the best embedding parameter for image watermarking with both robustness and imperceptibility. Initially, for providing robustness against watermarking attacks, a method for watermarking embedding is designed in the domain of Discrete Cosine Transform. After that, Ant Colony optimization is used for finding the optimization parameters. Then an observation data is obtained, which includes the feature vector and optimum strength values of the training images. The image features are extracted at different embedded strength values by the calculation of optimum fitness function. Finally Light Gradient Boosting algorithm (LGBA) is applied to predict the optimum embedding parameters of the set of new images which are to be water -marked. When compared with the existing optimization methods, it has been found that the proposed method consumes very less time for the evaluation of optimum solutions. From the results, it has been identified that the proposed algorithm satisfies the image watermarking with the improvement in time enhancement. The effectiveness of the proposed method is analyzed using MATLAB 2018b.(c) 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

The Science of Prognosis in Psychiatry A Review	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; ULTRA-HIGH RISK; PREDICTION MODELS; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; SAMPLE-SIZE; PSYCHOSIS RISK; INDIVIDUALS; CALCULATOR; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM	IMPORTANCE Prognosis is a venerable component of medical knowledge introduced by Hippocrates (460-377 BC). This educational review presents a contemporary evidence-based approach for how to incorporate clinical risk prediction models in modern psychiatry. The article is organized around key methodological themes most relevant for the science of prognosis in psychiatry. Within each theme, the article highlights key challenges and makes pragmatic recommendations to improve scientific understanding of prognosis in psychiatry. OBSERVATIONS The initial step to building clinical risk prediction models that can affect psychiatric care involves designing the model: preparation of the protocol and definition of the outcomes and of the statistical methods (theme 1). Further initial steps involve carefully selecting the predictors, preparing the data, and developing the model in these data. A subsequent step is the validation of the model to accurately test its generalizability (theme 2). The next consideration is that the accuracy of the clinical prediction model is affected by the incidence of the psychiatric condition under investigation (theme 3). Eventually, clinical prediction models need to be implemented in real-world clinical routine, and this is usually the most challenging step (theme 4). Advanced methods such as machine learning approaches can overcome some problems that undermine the previous steps (theme 5). The relevance of each of these themes to current clinical risk prediction modeling in psychiatry is discussed and recommendations are given. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Together, these perspectives intend to contribute to an integrative, evidence-based science of prognosis in psychiatry. By focusing on the outcome of the individuals, rather than on the disease, clinical risk prediction modeling can become the cornerstone for a scientific and personalized psychiatry.

J	Zhang, JH; Yan, J; Infield, D; Liu, YQ; Lien, FS				Zhang, Jinhua; Yan, Jie; Infield, David; Liu, Yongqian; Lien, Fue-sang			Short-term forecasting and uncertainty analysis of wind turbine power based on long short-term memory network and Gaussian mixture model	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Long short-term memory network; Gaussian mixture model; Wind turbine power; Short-term prediction; Uncertainty analysis	SPEED; DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM; PREDICTION; ENSEMBLE; RELM	Wind power plays a leading role in the development of renewable energy. However, the random nature of wind turbine power and its associated uncertainty create challenges in dispatching this power effectively in the power system, which can result in unnecessary curtailment of the wind turbine power. Improving the accuracy of wind turbine power forecasting is an effective measure for resolving such problems. This study uses a deep learning network to forecast the wind turbine power based on a long short-term memory network (LSTM) algorithm and uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to analyze the error distribution characteristics of short-term wind turbine power forecasting. The LSTM algorithm is used to forecast the power and uncertainties for three wind turbines within a wind farm. According to numerical weather prediction (NWP) data and historical power data for three turbines, the forecasting accuracy of the turbine with the largest number of training samples is the best of the three. For one of the turbines, the LSTM, radial basis function (RBF), wavelet, deep belief network (DBN), back propagation neural networks (BPNN), and Elman neural network (ELMAN) have been used to forecast the wind turbine power. This study compares the results and demonstrates that LSTM can greatly improve the forecasting accuracy. Moreover, this study obtains different confidence intervals for the three units according to the GMM, mixture density neural network (MDN), and relevance vector machine (RVM) model results. The LSTM method is shown to have higher accuracy and faster convergence than the other methods. However, the GMM method has better performance and evaluation than other methods and thus has practical application value for wind turbine power dispatching.

J	Li, YS; Ma, JY; Zhang, YJ				Li, Yansheng; Ma, Jiayi; Zhang, Yongjun			Image retrieval from remote sensing big data: A survey	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Remote sensing (rs) big data; Rs image retrieval methods; Rs image retrieval applications; Evaluation datasets and performance discussion; Future research directions		The blooming proliferation of aeronautics and astronautics platforms, together with the ever-increasing remote sensing imaging sensors on these platforms, has led to the formation of rapidly-growing earth observation data with the characteristics of large volume, large variety, large velocity, large veracity and large value, which raises awareness about the importance of large-scale image processing, fusion and mining. Unconsciously, we have entered an era of big earth data, also called remote sensing (RS) big data. Although RS big data provides great opportunities for a broad range of applications such as disaster rescue, global security, and so forth, it inevitably poses many additional processing challenges. As one of the most fundamental and important tasks in RS big data mining, image retrieval (i.e., image information mining) from RS big data has attracted continuous research interests in the last several decades. This paper mainly works for systematically reviewing the emerging achievements for image retrieval from RS big data. And then this paper further discusses the RS image retrieval based applications including fusion-oriented RS image processing, geo-localization and disaster rescue. To facilitate the quantitative evaluation of the RS image retrieval technique, this paper gives a list of publicly open datasets and evaluation metrics, and briefly recalls the mainstream methods on two representative benchmarks of RS image retrieval. Considering the latest advances from multiple domains including computer vision, machine learning and knowledge engineering, this paper points out some promising research directions towards RS big data mining. From this survey, engineers from industry may find skills to improve their RS image retrieval systems and researchers from academia may find ideas to conduct some innovative work.

J	Sherstinsky, A				Sherstinsky, Alex			Fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						RNN; RNN unfolding/unrolling; LSTM; External input gate; Convolutional input context windows	BACKPROPAGATION	Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of "unrolling'' an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the "Vanilla LSTM''1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.

J	Tang, JX; Long, Y				Tang, Jingxian; Long, Ying			Measuring visual quality of street space and its temporal variation: Methodology and its application in the Hutong area in Beijing	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Public space; Visual quality; Perceived quality; Street view picture; Hutong	SKY VIEW FACTOR; TREE COVER; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; URBAN DESIGN; REALITY; TOOL	Although it is widely known that quality of street space plays a vital role in promoting urban vibrancy, there is still no consensus on how to quantitatively measure it for a large scale. Recent emerging dataset Street View Picture has revealed the possibility to overcome the previous limit, thus bringing forward a research paradigm shift. Taking this advantage, this paper explores a new approach for visual quality evaluation and variation identification of street space for a large area. Hutongs, which typically represent for historical street space in Beijing, are selected for empirical study. In the experimental part, we capture multi-years Tencent Street View Picture covering all the Hutongs, and conduct both physical and perceived visual quality evaluation. The physical visual quality of street space is achieved automatically by combining 3-dimensional composition calculation of greenery, openness, enclosure using machine-learning segmentation method SegNet, and 2-dimensional analysis of street wall continuity and cross-sectional proportion; perceived visual quality of street space is evaluated by stay willingness scoring from five aspects. The variation of quality is evaluated based on the identified physical space variations. The result indicates that visual quality of Hutongs are not satisfied, while some regeneration projects in the historical protection block is better. Most Hutongs are in shortage of visual green, relative more continuous but with low cross-sectional ratio. Hutongs near main road witness an increasing trend of motorization. The difference between physical and perceived quality indicates the feasibility and limitation of the auto-calculation method. In the most recent 3-4 years, less than 2.5% Hutongs are improved, which are mainly slow beautification.

Genomic resources in plant breeding for sustainable agriculture	JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						Genomics; Sequencing; Genotyping platforms; Sequence-based trait mapping; Genomics-assisted breeding; Genomic breeding; Genomic selection	MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION; BACTERIAL-BLIGHT RESISTANCE; LEAF RUST RESISTANCE; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; TARGET SEQUENCING GBTS; SNP GENOTYPING ARRAY; DRAFT GENOME; ORYZA-SATIVA; QTL-SEQ; GENETIC DIVERSITY	Climate change during the last 40 years has had a serious impact on agriculture and threatens global food and nutritional security. From over half a million plant species, cereals and legumes are the most important for food and nutritional security. Although systematic plant breeding has a relatively short history, conventional breeding coupled with advances in technology and crop management strategies has increased crop yields by 56 % globally between 1965-85, referred to as the Green Revolution. Nevertheless, increased demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel necessitates the need to break existing yield barriers in many crop plants. In the first decade of the 21st century we witnessed rapid discovery, transformative technological development and declining costs of genomics technologies. In the second decade, the field turned towards making sense of the vast amount of genomic information and subsequently moved towards accurately predicting gene-to-phenotype associations and tailoring plants for climate resilience and global food security. In this review we focus on genomic resources, genome and germplasm sequencing, sequencing-based trait mapping, and genomics-assisted breeding approaches aimed at developing biotic stress resistant, abiotic stress tolerant and high nutrition varieties in six major cereals (rice, maize, wheat, barley, sorghum and pearl millet), and six major legumes (soybean, groundnut, cowpea, common bean, chickpea and pigeonpea). We further provide a perspective and way forward to use genomic breeding approaches including marker-assisted selection, marker-assisted backcrossing, haplotype based breeding and genomic prediction approaches coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence, to speed breeding approaches. The overall goal is to accelerate genetic gains and deliver climate resilient and high nutrition crop varieties for sustainable agriculture.

Using a county-panel dataset spanning the past 35 years, we evaluate the impact of global warming on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) as well as the impacts on agricultural inputs and outputs in China. Results show that, in the short run, extreme heat has negative effects on China's agricultural TFP and input utilization, which results in a more negative effect on agricultural output measured by yield. However, longer-run adaptation has offset 37.9% of the short-run effects of extreme heat exposure on TFP, while climate adaptation mitigates agricultural output loss to a greater extent due to more flexible adjustment in labor, fertilizer, and machines in the long run. Despite the detected climate adaptation, projections of impacts under future climate change scenarios still imply a substantial loss in China's agriculture.

In particular, we are interested in generating longer, richer and more fine-grained sentences and paragraphs as image descriptions. Image captioning can be translated to the task of sequential language prediction given visual content, where the output sequence forms natural language description with plausible grammar. However, existing image captioning methods focus only on language policy while not visual policy, and thus fail to capture visual context that are crucial for compositional reasoning such as object relationships (e.g., "man riding horse") and visual comparisons (e.g., "small(er) cat"). This issue is especially severe when generating longer sequences such as a paragraph. To fill the gap, we propose a Context-Aware Visual Policy network (CAVP) for fine-grained image-to-language generation: image sentence captioning and image paragraph captioning. During captioning, CAVP explicitly considers the previous visual attentions as context, and decides whether the context is used for the current word/sentence generation given the current visual attention. Compared against traditional visual attention mechanism that only fixes a single visual region at each step, CAVP can attend to complex visual compositions over time. The whole image captioning model-CAVP and its subsequent language policy network-can be efficiently optimized end-to-end by using an actor-critic policy gradient method. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of CAVP by state-of-the-art performances on MS-COCO and Stanford captioning datasets, using various metrics and sensible visualizations of qualitative visual context.

Recently, due to the strong behavior of convolutional neural network (CNN) in feature representation, the growing number of CNN-based classification methods has been proposed for RS images. Although they achieve cracking performance, there is still some room for improvement. First, apart from the global information, the local features are crucial to distinguish the RS images. The existing networks are good at capturing the global features since the CNNs' hierarchical structure and the nonlinear fitting capacity. However, the local features are not always emphasized. Second, to obtain satisfactory classification results, the distances of RS images from the same/different classes should be minimized/maximized. Nevertheless, these key points in pattern classification do not get the attention they deserve. To overcome the limitation mentioned above, we propose a new CNN named attention consistent network (ACNet) based on the Siamese network in this article. First, due to the dual-branch structure of ACNet, the input data are the image pairs that are obtained by the spatial rotation. This helps our model to fully explore the global features from RS images. Second, we introduce different attention techniques to mine the objects' information from RS images comprehensively. Third, considering the influence of the spatial rotation and the similarities between RS images, we develop an attention consistent model to unify the salient regions and impact/separate the RS images from the same/different semantic categories. Finally, the classification results can be obtained using the learned features. Three popular RS scene datasets are selected to validate our ACNet. Compared with some existing networks, the proposed method can achieve better performance. The encouraging results illustrate that ACNet is effective for the RS image scene classification. The source codes of this method can be found in https://github.com/TangXu-Group/Remote-Sensing-Images-Classification/tree/main/GLCnet.

From the past few years, it also became an attractive research area in visual computing. From the computational point of view, by far speech and text have been the most considered cues of information for analyzing personality. However, recently there has been an increasing interest from the computer vision community in analyzing personality from visual data. Recent computer vision approaches are able to accurately analyze human faces, body postures and behaviors, and use these information to infer apparent personality traits. Because of the overwhelming research interest in this topic, and of the potential impact that this sort of methods could have in society, we present in this paper an up-to-date review of existing vision-based approaches for apparent personality trait recognition. We describe seminal and cutting edge works on the subject, discussing and comparing their distinctive features and limitations. Future venues of research in the field are identified and discussed. Furthermore, aspects on the subjectivity in data labeling/evaluation, as well as current datasets and challenges organized to push the research on the field are reviewed.	[Jacques Junior, Julio C.

To mitigate wide-spread land degradation, actions have been taken to maintain and restore ecologically valuable landscapes such as natural forests. However, the effects of the various vegetation protection policies that have been implemented in China since the late 1990's still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we therefore focus on mapping land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Inner Mongolia, one of the key regions targeted by Chinese ecological restoration programs. We used 250-m MODIS time series and a random forest classification approach to generate annual probabilities for each land cover class between 2000 and 2014. We then applied a trajectory-based change detection approach based on a modified version of the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm to the probability time series and mapped land cover change trajectories. We found that our trajectory-based approach achieved high accuracies (overall accuracy 0.95 +/- 0.02). It provides spatial-temporal land change maps that allow a land-use related interpretation of change patterns. Our change maps show that i) forest loss decreased rapidly after 2000 (from 15,717 1770 ha in 2001 to 1313 165 ha in 2014) and forth gain (190,645 28,352 ha during 2001-2014) occurred in the ecological program zones, leading to a net forest increase in Inner Mongolia, and ii) cropland retirement (212,979 54,939 ha during 2001-2014) mostly occurred at the early stage of ecological programs and mainly concentrated in drier environments and steep terrain. Overall, land cover mapping and trajectory-based land use analyses allowed a consistent characterization of LULCC over large areas, which is crucial for gaining a better understanding of environmental changes in the light of rapidly changing environmental policies and governance regimes in China.

The key for solving fine-grained DR grading is to find more discriminative features corresponding to subtle visual differences, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages and soft exudates. However, small lesions are quite difficult to identify using traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and an imbalanced DR data distribution will cause the model to pay too much attention to DR grades with more samples, greatly affecting the final grading performance. In this article, we focus on developing an attention module to address these issues. Specifically, for imbalanced DR data distributions, we propose a novel Category Attention Block (CAB), which explores more discriminative region-wise features for each DR grade and treats each category equally. In order to capture more detailed small lesion information, we also propose the Global Attention Block (GAB), which can exploit detailed and class-agnostic global attention feature maps for fundus images. By aggregating the attention blocks with a backbone network, the CABNet is constructed for DR grading. The attention blocks can be applied to a wide range of backbone networks and trained efficiently in an end-to-end manner. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, showing that CABNet produces significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures with few additional parameters and achieves the state-of-the-art results for DR grading.

The key of achieving better performance is to well capture the non-linear spatial-temporal dependency. The state-of-the-art works consider both aspects, but they ignore the effect of the global trend on local dynamics and fail to capture long-term dynamic dependencies. In this article, we propose a novel Global-Local Temporal Convolutional Network (GL-TCN) to break through these limitations. Specifically, a novel local temporal convolutional mechanism is proposed to capture the long-term local dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, the global and local flow patterns are integrated to handle the effect of the global flow trend on local dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the temporal convolutional network for traffic flow prediction. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Quantifying these changes requires a business-asusual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) at 5756 observation sites in 46 countries from January through June 2020. Reductions in NO2 coincide with the timing and intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On average, NO2 concentrations were 18 (13-23)% lower than business as usual from February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% of the business-as-usual estimate. NO2 reductions in Europe and the US have been more gradual, with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that the global NOx (NO + NO2) emission reduction during the first 6 months of 2020 amounted to 3.1 (2.6-3.6) TgN, equivalent to 5.5 (4.7-6.4)% of the annual anthropogenic total. The response of surface O-3 is complicated by competing influences of nonlinear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O-3 increased by up to 50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O-3 between February-June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a flattening of the O-3 diurnal cycle with an increase in nighttime ozone due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a reduction in photochemical production. The O-3 response is dependent on season, timescale, and environment, with declines in surface O-3 forecasted if NOx emission reductions continue.	[Keller, Christoph A.; Knowland, K.

J	Zhao, DX; Arshad, M; Li, N; Triantafilis, J				Zhao, Dongxue; Arshad, Maryem; Li, Nan; Triantafilis, John			Predicting soil physical and chemical properties using vis-NIR in Australian cotton areas	CATENA			English	Article						Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy; Spiking; Cubist; Bootstrapped PLSR; Vertosols	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; REGRESSION	Management of Vertosols in southeast Australia, requires information about soil physical (e.g. particle size fractions) and chemical (e.g. cation exchange capacity [CEC - cmol(+) kg(-1)], exchangeable sodium percentage [ESP - %] and pH) properties. While visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy calibration models have been developed, little has been done in Vertosols. The performance of multi-depth or depth-specific (i.e. topsoil [0-0.3 m] subsurface [0.3-0.6 m] and subsoil [0.9-1.2 m]) calibration models has also seldom been discussed. In this paper, using a spiking approach across seven cotton growing areas, our first aim was to determine which model (e.g. machine learning algorithm (Cubist) or partial least square regression with bootstrap aggregation [bagging-PLSR]) produced better calibrations using multi-depth data. The second aim was to see how these calibrations predict depth-specific soil properties using independent validation. Our third aim was to investigate whether depth-specific calibrations could produce better predictions. In terms of multi-depth calibration, exemplified by CEC, Cubist (R-2 = 0.86) was stronger than bagging-PLSR (0.72). However, in terms of prediction agreement for independent validation, bagging-PLSR was superior to Cubist in the topsoil (LCCC = 0.84) and subsoil (0.83) and equivalent in the subsurface (0.74). Moreover, the depth-specific bagging-PLSR achieved equivelent prediction agreement for the independent validation of CEC to the multi-depth bagging-PLSR in the topsoil (LCCC = 0.85), subsoil (0.85) and subsurface (0.76). In terms of the other soil properties (i.e. clay, silt and sand), multi-depth bagging-PLSR was superior and overall a multi-depth spectral library is recommended for Vertosols. This has implications for acquiring a vis-NIR library more quickly and prediction efficiency with multi-depth calibrations.

Myocardial infarction detection based on deep neural network on imbalanced data	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						CNN; Myocardial infarction; End-to-end; PTB; Focal loss; Imbalanced data	AUTOMATED DETECTION; ECG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLEX; FUSION	Myocardial infarction (MI) is an acute interruption of blood flow to the heart, which causes the heart to suffer from a deficiency of blood and ischemia, so the heart muscle is damaged, and cells can die and lose their function. Despite the low incidence of MI in the world, it is still a common disease-causing death. Therefore, detecting the MI signals early can reduce mortality. This paper presented a method based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of MI automatically. The proposed CNN is an end-to-end model without requiring any stages of machine learning and requires only one stage to detect MI from the input signals. In the case of imbalanced data, we optimize our deep model with a new loss function named the focal loss to deal with this case by constituting the loss indirectly the focus in those difficult classes. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) dataset was employed in the validation to classify the signals to normal and MI. The performance of our technique alongside state-of-the-art in the area shows an increase in terms of average accuracy and F1 score. Results show that focal loss improves the detection accuracy by 9% for detecting MI signals. In summary, the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall of 98.84%, 98.31%, 97.92%, and 97.63, respectively using focal loss and overall accuracy of 89.72%, a precision of 88.52%, a recall of 81.11% and F1 score of 83.02% without using focal loss. Our method using focal loss is an effective tool to perform a fast and reliable MI diagnosis to assist the cardiologists in detecting MI early.

Using a minimally invasive neurointervention procedure, a novel endovascular Stentrode BCI was implanted in the superior sagittal sinus adjacent to primary motor cortex. The participants undertook machine-learning-assisted training to use wirelessly transmitted electrocorticography signal associated with attempted movements to control multiple mouse-click actions, including zoom and left-click. Used in combination with an eye-tracker for cursor navigation, participants achieved Windows 10 operating system control to conduct instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) tasks. Results Unsupervised home use commenced from day 86 onwards for participant 1, and day 71 for participant 2. Participant 1 achieved a typing task average click selection accuracy of 92.63% (100.00%, 87.50%-100.00%) (trial mean (median, Q1-Q3)) at a rate of 13.81 (13.44, 10.96-16.09) correct characters per minute (CCPM) with predictive text disabled. Participant 2 achieved an average click selection accuracy of 93.18% (100.00%, 88.19%-100.00%) at 20.10 (17.73, 12.27-26.50) CCPM. Completion of IADL tasks including text messaging, online shopping and managing finances independently was demonstrated in both participants. Conclusion We describe the first-in-human experience of a minimally invasive, fully implanted, wireless, ambulatory motor neuroprosthesis using an endovascular stent-electrode array to transmit electrocorticography signals from the motor cortex for multiple command control of digital devices in two participants with flaccid upper limb paralysis.

J	Dieci, MV; Miglietta, F; Guarneri, V				Dieci, Maria Vittoria; Miglietta, Federica; Guarneri, Valentina			Immune Infiltrates in Breast Cancer: Recent Updates and Clinical Implications	CELLS			English	Review						breast cancer; immune infiltrate; immune biomarker; tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; PD-L1; immunotherapy		In recent decades, the increasing interest in the field of immunotherapy has fostered an intense investigation of the breast cancer (BC) immune microenvironment. In this context, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as a clinically relevant and highly reproducible biomarker capable of affecting BC prognosis and response to treatment. Indeed, the evaluation of TILs on primary tumors proved to be strongly prognostic in triple-negative (TN) BC patients treated with either adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as well as in early TNBC patients not receiving any systemic treatment, thus gaining level-1b evidence in this setting. In addition, a strong relationship between TILs and pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported in all BC subtypes and the prognostic role of higher TILs in early HER2-positive breast cancer patients has also been demonstrated. The interest in BC immune infiltrates has been further fueled by the introduction of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment armamentarium of advanced TNBC in patients with PD-L1-positive status by FDA-approved assays. However, despite these advances, a biomarker capable of reliably and exhaustively predicting immunotherapy benefit in BC is still lacking, highlighting the imperative need to further deepen this issue. Finally, more comprehensive evaluation of immune infiltrates integrating both the quantity and quality of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and incorporation of TILs in composite scores encompassing other clinically or biologically relevant biomarkers, as well as the adoption of software-based and/or machine learning platforms for a more comprehensive characterization of BC immune infiltrates, are emerging as promising strategies potentially capable of optimizing patient selection and stratification in the research field. In the present review, we summarize available evidence and recent updates on immune infiltrates in BC, focusing on current clinical applications, potential clinical implications and major unresolved issues.

The present research focuses on using alternative binders to replace OPC. Geopolymer might be the best option because it requires waste materials enriched in aluminosilicate for its production. The research on geopolymer concrete (GPC) is growing rapidly. However, substantial effort and expenses are required to cast specimens, cures, and tests. Applying novel techniques for the said purpose is the key requirement for rapid and cost-effective research. In this research, supervised machine learning (SML) techniques, including two individual (decision tree (DT) and gene expression programming (GEP)) and two ensembled (bagging regressor (BR) and random forest (RF)) algorithms were employed to estimate the compressive strength (CS) of GPC. The validity and comparison of all the models were made using the coefficient of determination (R-2), k-fold, and statistical assessments. It was noticed that the ensembled SML techniques performed better than the individual SML techniques in forecasting the CS of GPC. However, individual SML model results were also in the reasonable range. The R-2 value for BR, RF, GEP, and DT models was 0.96, 0.95, 0.93, and 0.88, respectively. The models' lower error values such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square errors (RMSE) also verified the higher precision of ensemble SML methods. The RF (MAE = 2.585 MPa, RMSE = 3.702 MPa) and BR (MAE = 2.044 MPa, RMSE = 3.180) results are better than the DT (MAE = 4.136 MPa, RMSE = 6.256 MPa) and GEP (MAE = 3.102 MPa, RMSE = 4.049 MPa). The application of SML techniques will benefit the construction sector with fast and cost-effective methods for estimating the properties of materials.

However, wind energy forecasting is still a challenging task owing to its inherent features of non-linearity and randomness. Therefore, this study develops a hybrid wind energy forecasting and analysis system including a deterministic forecasting module and an uncertainty analysis module to mitigate the challenges in existing studies. In particular, these challenges are as follows: (1) It is difficult to guarantee that the data characteristics underlying the time series are effectively extracted; (2) in the modeling of each subseries, i.e., when the original data is decomposed into some time series, forecasting accuracy and stability are not simultaneously considered, and thus, they are not properly modeled; and (3) the best function to perform a deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis based on the forecaster of each subseries is unknown. The developed hybrid system consists of three steps: First, data preprocessing is conducted to capture and mine the main feature of the wind energy time series and weaken the noises' negative effects; second, multi-objective optimization is proposed to achieve the forecasting of each subseries with improvements in accuracy and stability; finally, search for the best function, which obtains the deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis results using an optimized extreme learning machine based on different modeling objectives, is conducted. Experimental simulations are performed using data from three sites in a real wind farm, which indicate that the developed system has a better performance in engineering applications than that of other methods. Furthermore, this system could not only be used as an effective tool for wind energy deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis, but also for other engineering application areas in the future.

The accuracy of data-driven RUL prediction model largely depends on the extraction method of performance degradation features. The individual heterogeneity and working condition difference of rolling hearings lead to the different performance degradation curves of rolling bearings, which result in the mismatch between the established RUL prediction model by the training rolling hearings and the test rolling bearings. If a feature is found, which can reflect the consistency of the performance degradation curve of each rolling bearings, and give the indicator to determine the node and predictable interval of the declining period, the accuracy of the RUL prediction model will he improved. To solve this problem, a new feature extraction method based on the data-driven method, namely, Fitting Curve Derivative Method of Maximum Power Spectrum Density (FDMPD), is proposed to extract the performance degradation features of the same or similar rolling bearings from the historical state monitoring data in this article. The FDMPD can make the performance degradation feature curves of life cycle, which takes on consistency trend for different rolling bearings, and the starting point of the rolling hearings to enter the degenerating period is defined and the working stage of rolling bearings is divided. Based on this, the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) and weight application to failure times (WAFT) are combined with FDMPD to establish a new RUL prediction model of rolling bearings, which can effectively realize the RUL prediction of rolling bearings. The whole life cycle data of rolling bearings are used to verify the validity of the RUL prediction model. The experimental results show that the established RUL prediction model can accurately predict the RUL of rolling hearings. It has the advantages of rapidity, stability, and applicability.

Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis	NATURE			English	Article							CONTINUOUS-FLOW; DESIGN; DEOXYFLUORINATION; FEASIBILITY; CHEMISTRY; MITSUNOBU; FLUORINE	Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates(1). Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems(2). Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models(3). Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry(4-9); however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run.

A review on opportunities for implementation of solar energy technologies in agricultural greenhouses	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Greenhouse cultivation; Energy saving; Solar thermal energy; Photovoltaics; Thermal energy storage; Sustainable development	PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; CHANGE MATERIALS PCMS; HEAT-STORAGE-SYSTEM; THERMAL-ENERGY; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; EXERGY ANALYSIS; AIR HEATER; INTEGRATED PHOTOVOLTAICS; CLOSED GREENHOUSE; SEASONAL STORAGE	The greenhouse industry is an energy-intensive sector with a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Addressing this issue, the employment of energy-saving strategies along with the replacement of conventional energy sources with renewable energies are among the most feasible solutions. Over the last few years, solar energy has demonstrated great potential for integration with agricultural greenhouses. The present study reviews the progress of solar greenhouses by investigating their integration with solar energy technologies including photovoltaic (PV), photovoltaic-thermal (PVT), and solar thermal collectors. From the literature, PV modules mounted on roofs or walls of greenhouses cause shading which can adversely affect the growing trend of cultivated crops inside. This issue can be addressed by using bifacial PV modules or employing sun trackers to create dynamic shades. PVT modules are more efficient in producing both heat and electricity, and less shading occurs when concentrating modules are employed. In terms of using solar thermal collectors, higher performance values have been reported for greenhouses installed in moderate climate conditions. Further, in this review, the employment of thermal energy storage (TES) units as crucial components for secure energy supply in solar greenhouses is studied. The usage of TES systems can increase the thermal performance of solar greenhouses by 29%. Additionally, the most common mathematical models utilized to describe the thermal behavior of solar greenhouses are presented and discussed. From the literature, machine learning algorithms have shown a better capability to describe the complex environment of greenhouses, but their main drawback is less reliability. Notwithstanding the progress which has been made, further improvements in technology and more reductions in costs are required to make the solar greenhouse technology a solution to achieve sustainable development.

The prevalence and prognostic importance of a dissociation between commanded motor behavior and brain activation in the first few days after brain injury are not well understood. MethodsWe studied a prospective, consecutive series of patients in a single intensive care unit who had acute brain injury from a variety of causes and who were unresponsive to spoken commands, including some patients with the ability to localize painful stimuli or to fixate on or track visual stimuli. Machine learning was applied to EEG recordings to detect brain activation in response to commands that patients move their hands. The functional outcome at 12 months was determined with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E; levels range from 1 to 8, with higher levels indicating better outcomes). ResultsA total of 16 of 104 unresponsive patients (15%) had brain activation detected by EEG at a median of 4 days after injury. The condition in 8 of these 16 patients (50%) and in 23 of 88 patients (26%) without brain activation improved such that they were able to follow commands before discharge. At 12 months, 7 of 16 patients (44%) with brain activation and 12 of 84 patients (14%) without brain activation had a GOS-E level of 4 or higher, denoting the ability to function independently for 8 hours (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 17.1). ConclusionsA dissociation between the absence of behavioral responses to motor commands and the evidence of brain activation in response to these commands in EEG recordings was found in 15% of patients in a consecutive series of patients with acute brain injury.

Although China is acknowledged as a global leader of forestation and has achieved considerable overall success in environmental improvements through mega-forestation programs, many negative effects have also emerged at local scales due to the planting of maladapted tree species. To better help achieve carbon neutrality and the new vision of an ecological civilization, China has committed to further increase forestation. However, where forestation lands and such efforts should really be located is not so well understood yet and agreed upon, especially in the face of rapid climate change. Based on an ensemble-learning machine, we predicted the spatial habitats (ecological niche) of the forest, grassland, shrubland, and desert under present and future climate conditions based on the natural climax vegetation distribution across China. We show that the potential forestation lands are mainly located in eastern China, which is east of the Hu Line (also known as the Heihe-Tengchong Line). Under future climate change, forests will shift substantially in the latitudinal, longitudinal, and elevational distribution. Potential forestation lands will increase by 33.1 million hectares through the 2070s, mainly due to the conversions of shrub and grassland to forests along the Hu Line. Our prediction map also indicates that grassland rehabilitation is the universal optimal vegetation restoration strategy in areas west of the Hu Line. This analysis is consistent with much of the observed evidence of forestation failures and recent climate-change-induced forest range shifts. Our results provide an overview and further show the importance of adaptive science-based forestation planning and forest management.

A Review of Holography in the Aquatic Sciences: In situ Characterization of Particles, Plankton, and Small Scale Biophysical Interactions	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Review						holography; underwater imaging; particle interactions; plankton distributions; plankton imaging; biophysical interactions; particle patchiness	THIN PHYTOPLANKTON LAYERS; MU-M; DIGITAL HOLOGRAPHY; BEAM ATTENUATION; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; BACKSCATTERING RATIO; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SETTLING VELOCITY; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; REFRACTIVE-INDEX	The characterization of particle and plankton populations, as well as microscale biophysical interactions, is critical to several important research areas in oceanography and limnology. A growing number of aquatic researchers are turning to holography as a tool of choice to quantify particle fields in diverse environments, including but not limited to, studies on particle orientation, thin layers, phytoplankton blooms, and zooplankton distributions and behavior. Holography provides a non-intrusive, free stream approach to imaging and characterizing aquatic particles, organisms, and behavior in situ at high resolution through a 3-D sampling volume. Compared to other imaging techniques, e.g., flow cytometry, much larger volumes of water can be processed over the same duration, resolving particle sizes ranging from a few microns to a few centimeters. Modern holographic imaging systems are compact enough to be deployed through various modes, including profiling/towed platforms, buoys, gliders, long-term observatories, or benthic landers. Limitations of the technique include the data-intensive hologram acquisition process, computationally expensive image reconstruction, and coherent noise associated with the holograms that can make post-processing challenging. However, continued processing refinements, rapid advancements in computing power, and development of powerful machine learning algorithms for particle/organism classification are paving the way for holography to be used ubiquitously across different disciplines in the aquatic sciences. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of holography in the context of aquatic studies, including historical developments, prior research applications, as well as advantages and limitations of the technique. Ongoing technological developments that can facilitate larger employment of this technique toward in situ measurements in the future, as well as potential applications in emerging research areas in the aquatic sciences are also discussed.

Smart vehicles have played a significant role in the advancement of intelligent and connected transportation systems. Continuous vehicular cloud service availability in smart cities is becoming a crucial subscriber necessity which requires improvement in the vehicular service management architecture. Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users' quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection. The proposed solution achieved an overall accuracy of 99.43% with 99.92% detection rate and 0.96% false positive and false negative rate of 1.53%. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of Weather Parameters on Endurance Running Performance: Discipline-specific Analysis of 1258 Races	MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS & EXERCISE			English	Article						MARATHON; HEAT; COLD; OLYMPICS; RACE; COMPETITION	GLOBE TEMPERATURE INDEX; MARATHON; HEAT; WET; CHAMPIONSHIPS; ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES; ATHLETICS; ILLNESSES; INJURIES	Introduction This study evaluated how single or combinations of weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar load) affect peak performance during endurance running events and identified which events are most vulnerable to varying weather conditions. Methods Results for the marathon, 50-km racewalking, 20-km racewalking, and 10,000-, 5000-, and 3000-m steeplechase were obtained from the official Web sites of large competitions. We identified meteorological data from nearby (8.9 +/- 9.3 km) weather stations for 1258 races held between 1936 and 2019 across 42 countries, enabling analysis of 7867 athletes. Results The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) across races ranged from -7 degrees C to 33 degrees C, with 27% of races taking place in cold/cool, 47% in neutral, 18% in moderate heat, 7% in high heat, and 1% in extreme heat conditions, according to the World Athletics classification. Machine learning decision trees (R-2 = 0.21-0.58) showed that air temperature (importance score = 40%) was the most important weather parameter. However, when used alone, air temperature had lower predictive power (R-2 = 0.04-0.34) than WBGT (R-2 = 0.11-0.47). Conditions of 7.5 degrees C-15 degrees C WBGT (or 10 degrees C-17.5 degrees C air temperature) increased the likelihood for peak performance. For every degree WBGT outside these optimum conditions, performance declined by 0.3%-0.4%. Conclusion More than one-quarter of endurance running events were held in moderate, high, or extreme heat, and this number reached one-half when marathons were excluded. All four weather parameters should be evaluated when aiming to mitigate the health and performance implications of exercising at high intensities in a hot environment with athletes adopting heat mitigation strategies when possible.

Most of our understanding of the spatial and temporal characteristics of these lifespan adaptations come from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including diffusion MRI (dMRI), which enables visualisation and quantification of brain white matter with unprecedented sensitivity and detail. However, with some notable exceptions, previous studies have relied on cross-sectional designs, limited age ranges, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based on conventional single-shell dMRI. In this mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study (mean interval: 15.2 months) including 702 multi-shell dMRI datasets, we combined complementary dMRI models to investigate age trajectories in healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years (57.12% women). Using linear mixed effect models and machine learning based brain age prediction, we assessed the age-dependence of diffusion metrics, and compared the age prediction accuracy of six different diffusion models, including diffusion tensor (DTI) and kurtosis imaging (DKI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), spherical mean technique multi-compartment (SMT-mc), and white matter tract integrity (WMTI). The results showed that the age slopes for conventional DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], axial diffusivity [AD], radial diffusivity [RD]) were largely consistent with previous research, and that the highest performing advanced dMRI models showed comparable age prediction accuracy to conventional DTI. Linear mixed effects models and Wilk's theorem analysis showed that the 'FA fine' metric of the RSI model and 'orientation dispersion' (OD) metric of the NODDI model showed the highest sensitivity to age. The results indicate that advanced diffusion models (DKI, NODDI, RSI, SMT mc, WMTI) provide sensitive measures of age-related microstructural changes of white matter in the brain that complement and extend the contribution of conventional DTI.

J	Mahdaviara, M; Rostami, A; Keivanimehr, F; Shahbazi, K				Mahdaviara, Mehdi; Rostami, Alireza; Keivanimehr, Farhad; Shahbazi, Khalil			Accurate determination of permeability in carbonate reservoirs using Gaussian Process Regression	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Permeability determination; Carbonate reservoir; Pore specific surface area; Gaussian process regression; Sensitivity analysis; Outliers detection	ABSOLUTE PERMEABILITY; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODELS; ALGORITHM; OIL	The knowledge of reservoir permeability determination is increasingly important in petroleum engineering. Understanding the alteration of the abovementioned parameter as a dynamic characteristic of formations helps the characterization of reservoir rock. The existing models available for permeability determination are mainly developed for sandstone reservoir; therefore, a great challenge is in the prediction of permeability in carbonate heterogeneous rock. The current study addresses the application of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, in estimating permeability of carbonate reservoirs. This Bayesian network offers various benefits including non-linearity and multi-dimensionality. A widespread source of data pertinent to four deposits of Vuktyl' skiy, central Asia, Kuybyhev, and Orenburg was adopted from literature. The data set includes water saturation, effective porosity, and pore specific surface area parameters in association with absolute rock permeability as the target. Four different Kernels of Matern, rational quadratic, exponential, and squared exponential are utilized as the covariance functions of the GPR network. A wide variety of the visualizations and statistical parameters are prepared to assess the potential of the established models in permeability estimation. Finally, it is demonstrated that the GPR (Matern) gives the highest precision with Mean Magnitude Relative Error (MMRE) and Adjusted R-squared equal to 38% and 0.98, respectively. Besides, the applied sensitivity analysis reveals that porosity and irreducible water saturation have the lowest and the highest absolute impact values on permeability estimation. The applicability and validity of the developed models are also demonstrated by means of the so-called Williams' method for outliers detection. At last, it is worthwhile mentioning that the created new methods in this study can be good nominees for permeability determination in characterizing the heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs.

IDTAXA: a novel approach for accurate taxonomic classification of microbiome sequences	MICROBIOME			English	Article						Microbiome; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; ITS sequencing; Classification; Taxonomic assignment; Reference taxonomy	RNA GENE-SEQUENCES; BAYESIAN CLASSIFIER; SEARCH; 16S; IDENTIFICATION; RETRIEVAL; BACTERIA	Background: Microbiome studies often involve sequencing a marker gene to identify the microorganisms in samples of interest. Sequence classification is a critical component of this process, whereby sequences are assigned to a reference taxonomy containing known sequence representatives of many microbial groups. Previous studies have shown that existing classification programs often assign sequences to reference groups even if they belong to novel taxonomic groups that are absent from the reference taxonomy. This high rate of "over classification" is particularly detrimental in microbiome studies because reference taxonomies are far from comprehensive. Results: Here, we introduce IDTAXA, a novel approach to taxonomic classification that employs principles from machine learning to reduce over classification errors. Using multiple reference taxonomies, we demonstrate that IDTAXA has higher accuracy than popular classifiers such as BLAST, MAPSeq, QIIME, SINTAX, SPINGO, and the RDP Classifier. Similarly, IDTAXA yields far fewer over classifications on Illumina mock microbial community data when the expected taxa are absent from the training set. Furthermore, IDTAXA offers many practical advantages over other classifiers, such as maintaining low error rates across varying input sequence lengths and withholding classifications from input sequences composed of random nucleotides or repeats. Conclusions: IDTAXA's classifications may lead to different conclusions in microbiome studies because of the substantially reduced number of taxa that are incorrectly identified through over classification. Although misclassification error is relatively minor, we believe that many remaining misclassifications are likely caused by errors in the reference taxonomy. We describe how IDTAXA is able to identify many putative mislabeling errors in reference taxonomies, enabling training sets to be automatically corrected by eliminating spurious sequences. IDTAXA is part of the DECIPHER package for the R programming language, available through the Bioconductor repository or accessible online (http://DECIPHER.codes).

Safety and Efficacy of B-Cell Depletion with Rituximab for the Treatment of Systemic Sclerosis-associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Trial	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						pulmonary hypertension; systemic sclerosis; treatment	PLEXIFORM LESIONS; SCLERODERMA; DISEASE; TISSUE; INFLAMMATION; ANTIBODIES; MICROCIRCULATION; PATHOGENESIS; MECHANISM; FIBROSIS	Rationale: Systemic sclerosis (SSc)-pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of PAH. B cells may contribute to SSc pathogenesis. Objectives: We investigated the safety and efficacy of B-cell depletion for SSc-PAH. Methods: In an NIH-sponsored, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial, 57 patients with SSc-PAH on stable-dose standard medical therapy received two infusions of 1,000 mg rituximab or placebo administered 2 weeks apart. The primary outcome measure was the change in 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) at 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included safety and invasive hemodynamics. We applied a machine learning approach to predict drug responsiveness. Measurements and Main Results: We randomized 57 subjects from 2010 to 2018. In the primary analysis, using data through Week 24, the adjusted mean change in 6MWD at 24 weeks favored the treatment arm but did not reach statistical significance (23.6 +/- 11.1mvs. 0.5 +/- 9.7 m; P = 0.12). Although a negative study, when data through Week 48 were also considered, the estimated change in 6MWD at Week 24 was 25.5 +/- 8.8 m for rituximab and 0.4 +/- 7.4 m for placebo (P = 0.03). Rituximab treatment appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Low levels of RF (rheumatoid factor), IL-12, and IL-17 were sensitive and specific as favorable predictors of a rituximab response as measured by an improved 6MWD (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve, 0.88-0.95). Conclusions: B-cell depletion therapy is a potentially effective and safe adjuvant treatment for SSc-PAH. Future studies in these patients can confirm whether the identified biomarkers predict rituximab responsiveness.

J	Orus, R				Orus, Roman			Tensor networks for complex quantum systems	NATURE REVIEWS PHYSICS			English	Review							MATRIX RENORMALIZATION-GROUP; ENTANGLED PAIR STATES; GROUND-STATES; ALGORITHMS	Originally developed in the context of condensed-matter physics and based on renormalization group ideas, tensor networks have been revived thanks to quantum information theory and the progress in understanding the role of entanglement in quantum many-body systems. Moreover, tensor network states have turned out to play a key role in other scientific disciplines. In this context, here I provide an overview of the basic concepts and key developments in the field. I briefly discuss the most important tensor network structures and algorithms, together with an outline of advances related to global and gauge symmetries, fermions, topological order, classification of phases, entanglement Hamiltonians, holografic duality, artificial intelligence, the 2D Hubbard model, 2D quantum antiferromagnets, conformal field theory, quantum chemistry, disordered systems and many-body localization. Understanding entanglement in many-body systems provided a description of complex quantum states in terms of tensor networks. This Review revisits the main tensor network structures, key ideas behind their numerical methods and their application in fields beyond condensed matter physics. Key pointsTensor networks are mathematical representations of quantum many-body states based on their entanglement structure.Different tensor network structures describe different physical situations, such as low-energy states of gapped 1D systems, 2D systems and scale-invariant systems.Variational methods over families of tensor networks enable the approximation of the low-energy properties of complex quantum Hamiltonians. Other methods also allow the simulation of time evolution, the calculation of low-energy excitations and much more.Symmetric tensor network states enable more efficient simulation methods and the description of fermionic systems, lattice gauge theories, topological order and the classification of phases of quantum matter.Tensor networks, such as the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz, have been linked to a possible lattice realization of the holographic principle in quantum gravity.Tensor networks also provide a natural framework for understanding machine learning and probabilistic language models.

J	Hu, ZG; Wang, YX; Zhao, D				Hu, Zhigang; Wang, Yuxiang; Zhao, Dan			The chemistry and applications of hafnium and cerium(iv) metal-organic frameworks	CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS			English	Review							CATALYTIC TRANSFER HYDROGENATION; MODULATED HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; INFINITE POLYMERIC FRAMEWORKS; CONTINUOUS-FLOW PRODUCTION; WATER-BASED SYNTHESIS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BRONSTED ACIDITY; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYST; CO2 ADSORPTION; SCALE-UP	The coordination connection of organic linkers to the metal clusters leads to the formation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), where the metal clusters and ligands are spatially entangled in a periodic manner. The immense availability of tuneable ligands of different length and functionalities gives rise to robust molecular porosity ranging from several angstroms to nanometres. Among the large family of MOFs, hafnium (Hf) based MOFs have been demonstrated to be highly promising for practical applications due to their unique and outstanding characteristics such as chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability, and acidic nature. Since the report of UiO-66(Hf) and DUT-51(Hf) in 2012, less than 200 Hf-MOFs (ca. 50 types of structures) have been reported. Besides, tetravalent cerium [Ce(iv)] has been proven to be capable of forming similar topological MOF structures to Zr and Hf since its first discovery in 2015. So far, ca. 40 Ce(iv) MOFs with 60% having UiO-66-type structure have been reported. This review will offer a holistic summary of the chemistry, uniqueness, synthesis, and applications of Hf/Ce(iv)-MOFs with a focus on presenting the development in the Hf/Ce(iv)-clusters, topologies, ligand structures, synthetic strategies, and practical applications of Hf/Ce(iv)-MOFs. In the end, we will present the research outlook for the development of Hf/Ce(iv)-MOFs in the future, including fundamental design of Hf/Ce(iv)-clusters, defect engineering, and various applications including membrane development, diversified types of catalytic reactions, irradiation absorption in nuclear waste treatment, water production and wastewater treatment, etc. We will also present the emerging computational approaches coupled with machine-learning algorithms that can be applied in screening Hf and Ce(iv) based MOF structures and identifying the best-performing MOFs for tailor-made applications in future practice.

As Glaucoma appears in later stages and it is a slow disease, detailed screening and detection of the retinal images is required to avoid vision forfeiture. This study aims to detect glaucoma at early stages with the help of deep learning-based feature extraction. Retinal fundus images are utilized for the training and testing of our proposed model. In the first step, images are pre-processed, before the region of interest (ROI) is extracted employing segmentation. Then, features of the optic disc (OD) are extracted from the images containing optic cup (OC) utilizing the hybrid features descriptors, i.e., convolutional neural network (CNN), local binary patterns (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and speeded up robust features (SURF). Moreover, low-level features are extracted using HOG, whereas texture features are extracted using the LBP and SURF descriptors. Furthermore, high-level features are computed using CNN. Additionally, we have employed a feature selection and ranking technique, i.e., the MR-MR method, to select the most representative features. In the end, multi-class classifiers, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), are employed for the classification of fundus images as healthy or diseased. To assess the performance of the proposed system, various experiments have been performed using combinations of the aforementioned algorithms that show the proposed model based on the RF algorithm with HOG, CNN, LBP, and SURF feature descriptors, providing <= 99% accuracy on benchmark datasets and 98.8% on k-fold cross-validation for the early detection of glaucoma.

Feature Boosting Network For 3D Pose Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Three-dimensional displays; Pose estimation; Two dimensional displays; Boosting; Logic gates; Reliability; Task analysis; 3D pose estimation; convolutional LSTM; long short-term dependency; context consistency gate		In this paper, a feature boosting network is proposed for estimating 3D hand pose and 3D body pose from a single RGB image. In this method, the features learned by the convolutional layers are boosted with a new long short-term dependence-aware (LSTD) module, which enables the intermediate convolutional feature maps to perceive the graphical long short-term dependency among different hand (or body) parts using the designed Graphical ConvLSTM. Learning a set of features that are reliable and discriminatively representative of the pose of a hand (or body) part is difficult due to the ambiguities, texture and illumination variation, and self-occlusion in the real application of 3D pose estimation. To improve the reliability of the features for representing each body part and enhance the LSTD module, we further introduce a context consistency gate (CCG) in this paper, with which the convolutional feature maps are modulated according to their consistency with the context representations. We evaluate the proposed method on challenging benchmark datasets for 3D hand pose estimation and 3D full body pose estimation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both of the tasks.

Derivation, Validation, and Potential Treatment Implications of Novel Clinical Phenotypes for Sepsis	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY; LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS; MORTALITY; RISK; DEFINITIONS; ADULTS; TRIAL	IMPORTANCE Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may allow more precise therapy and improve care. OBJECTIVE To derive sepsis phenotypes from clinical data, determine their reproducibility and correlation with host-response biomarkers and clinical outcomes, and assess the potential causal relationship with results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective analysis of data sets using statistical, machine learning, and simulation tools. Phenotypes were derived among 20 189 total patients (16 552 unique patients) who met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of hospital presentation at 12 Pennsylvania hospitals (2010-2012) using consensus k means clustering applied to 29 variables. Reproducibility and correlation with biological parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed in a second database (2013-2014; n = 43 086 total patients and n = 31 160 unique patients), in a prospective cohort study of sepsis due to pneumonia (n = 583), and in 3 sepsis RCTs (n = 4737). EXPOSURES All clinical and laboratory variables in the electronic health record. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Derived phenotype (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) frequency, host-response biomarkers, 28-day and 365-day mortality, and RCT simulation outputs. RESULTS The derivation cohort included 20 189 patients with sepsis (mean age, 64 [SD, 17] years; 10 022 [50%] male; mean maximum 24-hour Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, 3.9 [SD, 2.4]). The validation cohort included 43 086 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 17] years; 21 993 [51%] male; mean maximum 24-hour SOFA score, 3.6 [SD, 2.0]). Of the 4 derived phenotypes, the a phenotype was the most common (n = 6625; 33%) and included patients with the lowest administration of a vasopressor; in the beta phenotype (n = 5512; 27%), patients were older and had more chronic illness and renal dysfunction; in the gamma phenotype (n = 5385; 27%), patients had more inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction; and in the delta phenotype (n = 2667; 13%), patients had more liver dysfunction and septic shock. Phenotype distributions were similar in the validation cohort. There were consistent differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype. In the derivation cohort, cumulative 28-day mortality was 287 deaths of 5691 unique patients (5%) for the alpha phenotype; 561 of 4420 (13%) for the beta phenotype; 1031 of 4318 (24%) for the gamma phenotype; and 897 of 2223 (40%) for the delta phenotype. Across all cohorts and trials, 28-day and 365-day mortality were highest among the delta phenotype vs the other 3 phenotypes (P<.001). In simulation models, the proportion of RCTs reporting benefit, harm, or no effect changed considerably (eg, varying the phenotype frequencies within an RCT of early goal-directed therapy changed the results from >33% chance of benefit to >60% chance of harm). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this retrospective analysis of data sets from patients with sepsis, 4 clinical phenotypes were identified that correlated with host-response patterns and clinical outcomes, and simulations suggested these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity of treatment effects. Further research is needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical care and for informing trial design and interpretation.

SDV-F tackles numerous problems, such as scalability, load-balancing, energy consumption, and security. It lags, however, in providing a promising approach to enable ultra-reliable and delay-sensitive applications with high vehicle mobility over SDV-F. We propose ARTNet, an AI-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) framework for resource distribution and optimized communication using the SDV-F architecture. ARTNet offers ultra-reliable and low-latency communications, particularly in highly dynamic environments, which is still a challenge in IoV. ARTNet is composed of intelligent agents/controllers, to make decisions intelligently about (i) maximizing resource utilization at the fog layer, and (ii) minimizing the average end-to-end delay of time-critical IoV applications. Moreover, ARTNet is designed to assign a task to fog nodes based on their states. Our experimental results show that considering a dynamic IoV environment, ARTNet can efficiently distribute the fog layer tasks while minimizing the delay.

Solving the FWI problem can be challenging due to its ill-posedness and high computational cost. In this work, we develop a new hybrid computational approach to solve FWI that combines physics-based models with data-driven methodologies. In particular, we develop a data augmentation strategy that can not only improve the representativity of the training set but also incorporate important governing physics into the training process and, therefore, improve the inversion accuracy. To validate the performance, we apply our method to synthetic elastic seismic waveform data generated from a subsurface geologic model built on a carbon sequestration site at Kimberlina, California. We compare our physics-consistent data-driven inversion method to both purely physics-based and purely data-driven approaches and observe that our method yields higher accuracy and greater generalization ability.

J	Franti, P; Sieranoja, S				Franti, Pasi; Sieranoja, Sami			How much can k-means be improved by using better initialization and repeats?	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Clustering algorithms; K-means; Initialization; Clustering accuracy; Prototype selection	CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; SEARCH ALGORITHM; QUANTIZATION; IMPLEMENTATION; INDEX	In this paper, we study what are the most important factors that deteriorate the performance of the k-means algorithm, and how much this deterioration can be overcome either by using a better initialization technique, or by repeating (restarting) the algorithm. Our main finding is that when the clusters overlap, k-means can be significantly improved using these two tricks. Simple furthest point heuristic (Maxmin) reduces the number of erroneous clusters from 15% to 6%, on average, with our clustering benchmark. Repeating the algorithm 100 times reduces it further down to 1%. This accuracy is more than enough for most pattern recognition applications. However, when the data has well separated clusters, the performance of k-means depends completely on the goodness of the initialization. Therefore, if high clustering accuracy is needed, a better algorithm should be used instead. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

First, we introduce a clustering basic benchmark. Second, we study the performance of k-means using this benchmark. Specifically, we measure how the performance depends on four factors: (1) overlap of clusters, (2) number of clusters, (3) dimensionality, and (4) unbalance of cluster sizes. The results show that overlap is critical, and that k-means starts to work effectively when the overlap reaches 4% level.

CDMER is more challenging than the conventional micro-expression recognition (MER), because the training and testing samples in CDMER come from different micro-expression databases, resulting in inconsistency of the feature distributions between the training and testing sets. In this paper, we contribute to this topic from three aspects. First, we establish a CDMER experimental evaluation protocol aiming to allow the researchers to conveniently work on this topic and evaluate their proposed methods under the same standard. Second, we conduct benchmark experiments by using NINE state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) methods and SIX popular spatiotemporal descriptors for investigating CDMER problem from two different perspectives. Third, we propose a novel DA method called region selective transfer regression (RSTR) to deal with the CDMER task. The overall superior performance of RSTR over the state-of-the-art DA methods demonstrates that taking into consideration the facial local region information used in RSTR contributes to developing effective DA methods for dealing with CDMER problem.

This notion is inspired by an observation in the decoding process of deep image matting where indices-guided unpooling can often recover boundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as bilinear interpolation. By viewing the indices as a function of the feature map, we introduce the concept of 'learning to index', and present a novel index-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are learned adaptively from data and are used to guide downsampling and upsampling stages, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a new learnable module, termed Index Network (IndexNet), which dynamically generates indices conditioned on the feature map. IndexNet can be used as a plug-in, applicable to almost all convolutional networks that have coupled downsampling and upsampling stages, enabling the networks to dynamically capture variations of local patterns. In particular, we instantiate and investigate five families of IndexNet. We highlight their superiority in delivering spatial information over other upsampling operators with experiments on synthetic data, and demonstrate their effectiveness on four dense prediction tasks, including image matting, image denoising, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

J	Shu, XB; Tang, JH; Qi, GJ; Liu, W; Yang, J				Shu, Xiangbo; Tang, Jinhui; Qi, Guo-Jun; Liu, Wei; Yang, Jian			Hierarchical Long Short-Term Concurrent Memory for Human Interaction Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Dynamics; Videos; Logic gates; Deep learning; Task analysis; Pattern recognition; Feeds; Human interaction recognition; long short-term memory; activity recognition; deep learning		In this work, we aim to address the problem of human interaction recognition in videos by exploring the long-term inter-related dynamics among multiple persons. Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has become a popular choice to model individual dynamic for single-person action recognition due to its ability to capture the temporal motion information in a range. However, most existing LSTM-based methods focus only on capturing the dynamics of human interaction by simply combining all dynamics of individuals or modeling them as a whole. Such methods neglect the inter-related dynamics of how human interactions change over time. To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Long Short-Term Concurrent Memory (H-LSTCM) to model the long-term inter-related dynamics among a group of persons for recognizing human interactions. Specifically, we first feed each person's static features into a Single-Person LSTM to model the single-person dynamic. Subsequently, at one time step, the outputs of all Single-Person LSTM units are fed into a novel Concurrent LSTM (Co-LSTM) unit, which mainly consists of multiple sub-memory units, a new cell gate, and a new co-memory cell. In the Co-LSTM unit, each sub-memory unit stores individual motion information, while this Co-LSTM unit selectively integrates and stores inter-related motion information between multiple interacting persons from multiple sub-memory units via the cell gate and co-memory cell, respectively. Extensive experiments on several public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed H-LSTCM by comparing against baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

A connectome and analysis of the adult Drosophila central brain	ELIFE			English	Article							CENTRAL COMPLEX; MUSHROOM BODY; SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; PROJECTION NEURONS; WILD-TYPE; ORGANIZATION; MELANOGASTER; COMPARTMENTALIZATION; RECONSTRUCTION; ARCHITECTURE	The neural circuits responsible for animal behavior remain largely unknown. We summarize new methods and present the circuitry of a large fraction of the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Improved methods include new procedures to prepare, image, align, segment, find synapses in, and proofread such large data sets. We define cell types, refine computational compartments, and provide an exhaustive atlas of cell examples and types, many of them novel. We provide detailed circuits consisting of neurons and their chemical synapses for most of the central brain. We make the data public and simplify access, reducing the effort needed eLife digest Animal brains of all sizes, from the smallest to the largest, work in broadly similar ways. Studying the brain of any one animal in depth can thus reveal the general principles behind the workings of all brains. The fruit fly Drosophila is a popular choice for such research. With about 100,000 neurons - compared to some 86 billion in humans - the fly brain is small enough to study at the level of individual cells. But it nevertheless supports a range of complex behaviors, including navigation, courtship and learning. Thanks to decades of research, scientists now have a good understanding of which parts of the fruit fly brain support particular behaviors. But exactly how they do this is often unclear. This is because previous studies showing the connections between cells only covered small areas of the brain. This is like trying to understand a novel when all you can see is a few isolated paragraphs. To solve this problem, Scheffer, Xu, Januszewski, Lu, Takemura, Hayworth, Huang, Shinomiya et al. prepared the first complete map of the entire central region of the fruit fly brain. The central brain consists of approximately 25,000 neurons and around 20 million connections. To prepare the map - or connectome - the brain was cut into very thin 8nm slices and photographed with an electron microscope. A three-dimensional map of the neurons and connections in the brain was then reconstructed from these images using machine learning algorithms. Finally, Scheffer et al. used the new connectome to obtain further insights into the circuits that support specific fruit fly behaviors. The central brain connectome is freely available online for anyone to access. When used in combination with existing methods, the map will make it easier to understand how the fly brain works, and how and why it can fail to work correctly. Many of these findings will likely apply to larger brains, including our own. In the long run, studying the fly connectome may therefore lead to a better understanding of the human brain and its disorders. Performing a similar analysis on the brain of a small mammal, by scaling up the methods here, will be a likely next step along this path.	[Scheffer, Louis K.; Xu, C.

Several recent studies have evaluated the potential of SIF retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) in estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) based on GPP data from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers. However, the spatially and temporally sparse nature of OCO-2 data makes it challenging to use these data for many applications from the ecosystem to the global scale. Here, we developed a new global OCO-2' SIF data set (GOSIF) with high spatial and temporal resolutions (i.e., 0.05 degrees, 8-day) over the period 2000-2017 based on a data-driven approach. The predictive SIF model was developed based on discrete OCO-2 SIF soundings, remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological reanalysis data. Our model performed well in estimating SIF (R-2 = 0.79, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.07 W m(-2) m(-1) sr(-1)). The model was then used to estimate SIF for each 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees grid cell and each 8-day interval for the study period. The resulting GOSIF product has reasonable seasonal cycles, and captures the similar seasonality as both the coarse-resolution OCO-2 SIF (1 degrees), directly aggregated from the discrete OCO-2 soundings, and tower-based GPP. Our SIF estimates are highly correlated with GPP from 91 EC flux sites (R-2 = 0.73, p < 0.001). They capture the expected spatial and temporal patterns and also have remarkable ability to highlight the crop areas with the highest daily productivity across the globe. Our product also allows us to examine the long-term trends in SIF globally. Compared with the coarse-resolution SIF that was directly aggregated from OCO-2 soundings, GOSIF has finer spatial resolution, globally continuous coverage, and a much longer record. Our GOSIF product is valuable for assessing terrestrial photosynthesis and ecosystem function, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.

Without a focusing lens, the lensless cameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed measurements. However, the current iterative-optimization-based reconstruction algorithms produce noisier and perceptually poorer images. In this work, we propose a non-iterative deep learning-based reconstruction approach that results in orders of magnitude improvement in image quality for lensless reconstructions. Our approach, called FlatNet, lays down a framework for reconstructing high-quality photorealistic images from mask-based lensless cameras, where the camera's forward model formulation is known. FlatNet consists of two stages: (1) an inversion stage that maps the measurement into a space of intermediate reconstruction by learning parameters within the forward model formulation, and (2) a perceptual enhancement stage that improves the perceptual quality of this intermediate reconstruction. These stages are trained together in an end-to-end manner. We show high-quality reconstructions by performing extensive experiments on real and challenging scenes using two different types of lensless prototypes: one which uses a separable forward model and another, which uses a more general non-separable cropped-convolution model. Our end-to-end approach is fast, produces photorealistic reconstructions, and is easy to adopt for other mask-based lensless cameras.

However, most deep CNN based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-quality images; thereby, resulting in relatively-low performance. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in IR, by making a better tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness in exploiting the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with several representative IR applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, image compression artifact reduction, and image deblurring. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods for each IR task quantitatively and visually.

This goal can be obtained using an advanced data classification model with a rich source of traffic information. Several systems based on sensors and social networking platforms have been presented recently to detect traffic events and monitor traffic conditions. However, sensor-based systems provide limited information, and may fail owing to the long detection times and high false-alarm rates. In addition, social networking data are unstructured, unpredictable, and contain idioms, jargon, and dynamic topics. The machine learning algorithms utilized for traffic event detection might not extract valuable information from social networking data. In this paper, a social network-based, real-time monitoring framework is proposed for traffic accident detection and condition analysis using ontology and latent Dirichlet allocation (OLDA) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). First, the query-based search engine effectively collects traffic information from social networks, and the data preprocessing module transforms it into structured form. Second, the proposed OLDA-based topic modeling method automatically labels each sentence (e.g., traffic or non-traffic) to identify the exact traffic information. In addition, the ontology-based event recognition approach detects traffic events from traffic-related data. Next, the sentiment analysis technique identifies the polarity of traffic events employing user's opinions, which helps determine accurate conditions of traffic events. Finally, the Fast-Text model and Bi-LSTM with softmax regression are trained for traffic event detection and condition analysis. The proposed framework is evaluated using traffic-related data, comparing OLDA and Bi-LSTM with existing topic modeling methods and traditional classifiers using word embedding models, respectively. Our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves accuracy of 97 %. This finding demonstrates that the proposed system is more efficient for traffic event detection and condition analysis, in comparison to other existing systems.

Herein, we aimed to determine what drives tumor cell evolution by performing single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Methods: We analyzed 46 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) biopsies from 37 patients enrolled in interventional studies at the NIH Clinical Center, with 16 biopsies collected before and after treatment from 7 patients. We developed a novel machine learning-based consensus clustering approach to track cellular states of 57,000 malignant and non-malignant cells including tumor cell transcriptome-based functional clonality analysis. We determined tumor cell relationships using RNA velocity and reverse graph embedding. We also studied longitudinal samples from 4 patients to determine tumor cellular state and its evolution. We validated our findings in bulk transcriptomic data from 488 patients with HCC and 277 patients with iCCA. Results: Using transcriptomic clusters as a surrogate for functional clonality, we observed an increase in tumor cell state heterogeneity which was tightly linked to patient prognosis. Furthermore, increased functional clonality was accompanied by a polarized immune cell landscape which included an increase in pre-exhausted T cells. We found that SPP1 expressionwas tightly associated with tumor cell evolution and microenvironmental reprogramming. Finally, we developed a user-friendly online interface as a knowledge base for a single-cell atlas of liver cancer. Conclusions: Our study offers insight into the collective behavior of tumor cell communities in liver cancer as well as potential drivers of tumor evolution in response to therapy. Lay summary: Intratumor molecular heterogeneity is a key feature of tumorigenesis that is linked to treatment failure and patient prognosis. In this study, we present a single-cell atlas of liver tumors from patients treated with immunotherapy and describe intratumoral cell states and their hierarchical relationship. We suggest osteopontin, encoded by the gene SPP1, as a candidate regulator of tumor evolution in response to treatment.Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Andrew			Development and Validation of the Quick COVID-19 Severity Index: A Prognostic Tool for Early Clinical Decompensation	ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							PREDICTION	Study objective: The goal of this study is to create a predictive, interpretable model of early hospital respiratory failure among emergency department (ED) patients admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: This was an observational, retrospective, cohort study from a 9-ED health system of admitted adult patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) and an oxygen requirement less than or equal to 6 L/min. We sought to predict respiratory failure within 24 hours of admission as defined by oxygen requirement of greater than 10 L/min by low-flow device, high-flow device, noninvasive or invasive ventilation, or death. Predictive models were compared with the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment, and the CURB-65 pneumonia severity score. Results: During the study period, from March 1 to April 27, 2020, 1,792 patients were admitted with COVID-19, 620 (35%) of whom had respiratory failure in the ED. Of the remaining 1,172 admitted patients, 144 (12.3%) met the composite endpoint within the first 24 hours of hospitalization. On the independent test cohort, both a novel bedside scoring system, the quick COVID-19 Severity Index (area under receiver operating characteristic curve mean 0.81 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.73 to 0.89]), and a machine-learning model, the COVID-19 Severity Index (mean 0.76 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.86]), outperformed the Elixhauser mortality index (mean 0.61 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.70]), CURB-65 (0.50 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.60]), and quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (0.59 [95% CI 0.50 to 0.68]). A low quick COVID-19 Severity Index score was associated with a less than 5% risk of respiratory decompensation in the validation cohort. Conclusion: A significant proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients progress to respiratory failure within 24 hours of admission. These events are accurately predicted with bedside respiratory examination findings within a simple scoring system.	[Haimovich, Adrian D.; Stoytchev, Stoytcho; Taylor, R.

M.; Graeler, Benedikt			Random forest as a generic framework for predictive modeling of spatial and spatio-temporal variables	PEERJ			English	Article						Random forest; Kriging; Predictive modeling; R statistical computing; Sampling; Spatiotemporal data; Spatial data; Geostatistics; Pedometrics	GEOSTATISTICS; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; SAMPLE; MAPS	Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as "knowledge engines'' in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality-especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with lower number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.

Gaia Collaboration	Gaia Early Data Release 3 The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						catalogs; astrometry; stars: luminosity function; mass function; Hertzsprung-Russell and C-M diagrams; stars: low-mass; solar neighborhood	DWARF LUMINOSITY-FUNCTION; CIRCULAR-VELOCITY CURVE; NORTH GALACTIC POLE; SOLAR-TYPE STARS; TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES; WIDE BINARIES; MAIN-SEQUENCE; BROWN DWARF; SKY-SURVEY; WHITE-DWARFS	Aims. We produce a clean and well-characterised catalogue of objects within 100 pc of the Sun from the Gaia Early Data Release 3. We characterise the catalogue through comparisons to the full data release, external catalogues, and simulations. We carry out a first analysis of the science that is possible with this sample to demonstrate its potential and best practices for its use. Methods. Theselection of objects within 100 pc from the full catalogue used selected training sets, machine-learning procedures, astrometric quantities, and solution quality indicators to determine a probability that the astrometric solution is reliable. The training set construction exploited the astrometric data, quality flags, and external photometry. For all candidates we calculated distance posterior probability densities using Bayesian procedures and mock catalogues to define priors. Any object with reliable astrometry and a non-zero probability of being within 100 pc is included in the catalogue. Results. We have produced a catalogue of 331 312 objects that we estimate contains at least 92% of stars of stellar type M9 within 100 pc of the Sun. We estimate that 9% of the stars in this catalogue probably lie outside 100 pc, but when the distance probability function is used, a correct treatment of this contamination is possible. We produced luminosity functions with a high signal-to-noise ratio for the main-sequence stars, giants, and white dwarfs. We examined in detail the Hyades cluster, the white dwarf population, and wide-binary systems and produced candidate lists for all three samples. We detected local manifestations of several streams, superclusters, and halo objects, in which we identified 12 members of Gaia Enceladus. We present the first direct parallaxes of five objects in multiple systems within 10 pc of the Sun. Conclusions. We provide the community with a large, well-characterised catalogue of objects in the solar neighbourhood. This is a primary benchmark for measuring and understanding fundamental parameters and descriptive functions in astronomy.	[Smart, R. L.; Abbas, U.; Bucciarelli, B.; Cooper, W.

Durability of progression-free survival (PFS) with ibrutinib can vary by patient subgroup. Clinical tools for prognostication and risk-stratification are needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients treated with ibrutinib in phase II and III trials provided the discovery data set and were subdivided into discovery and internal validation cohorts. An external validation cohort included 84 patients enrolled in our investigator-initiated phase II trial. Univariable analysis of 18 pretreatment parameters was performed using PFS and overall survival (OS) end-points. Multivariable analysis and machine-learning algorithms identified four factors for a prognostic model that was validated in internal and external cohorts. RESULTS Factors independently associated with inferior PFS and OS were as follows: TP53 aberration, prior treatment, beta-2 microglobulin >= 5 mg/L, and lactate dehydrogenase > 250 U/L. Each of these four factors contributed one point to a prognostic model that stratified patients into three risk groups: three to four points, high risk; two points, intermediate risk; zero to one point, low risk. The 3-year PFS rates for all 804 patients combined were 47%, 74%, and 87% for the high-, the intermediate-, and the low-risk group, respectively (P < .0001). The 3-year OS rates were 63%, 83%, and 93%, respectively (P < .0001). The model remained significant when applied to treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory cohorts individually. For 84 patients in the external cohort, BTK and PLCG2 mutations were tested cross-sectionally and at progression. The cumulative incidences of mutations were strongly correlated with the model. In the external cohort, Richter's transformation occurred in 17% of the high-risk group, and in no patient in the low-risk group. CONCLUSION Patients at increased risk of ibrutinib failure can be identified at treatment initiation and considered for clinical trials.

Oncology terms such as big killers to identify tumours with yet a high mortality rate or undruggable cancer targets, and chemoresistance, represent the current therapeutic debacle of cancer treatments. In addition, metastases, tumour microenvironments, tumour heterogeneity, metabolic adaptations, and immunotherapy resistance are essential features controlling tumour response to therapies, but still, lack effective therapeutics or modulators. In this scenario, where the pharmaceutical productivity and drug efficacy in oncology seem to have reached a plateau, the so-called drug repurposing i.e. the use of old drugs, already in clinical use, for a different therapeutic indication is an appealing strategy to improve cancer therapy. Opportunities for drug repurposing are often based on occasional observations or on time-consuming pre-clinical drug screenings that are often not hypothesis-driven. In contrast, in-silico drug repurposing is an emerging, hypothesis-driven approach that takes advantage of the use of big data. Indeed, the extensive use of-omics technologies, improved data storage, data meaning, machine learning algorithms, and computational modeling all offer unprecedented knowledge of the biological mechanisms of cancers and drugs' modes of action, providing extensive availability for both disease-related data and drugs-related data. This offers the opportunity to generate, with time and cost-effective approaches, computational drug networks to predict, in-silico, the efficacy of approved drugs against relevant cancer targets, as well as to select better responder patients or disease' biomarkers. Here, we will review selected disease-related data together with computational tools to be exploited for the insilico repurposing of drugs against validated targets in cancer therapies, focusing on the oncogenic signaling pathways activation in cancer. We will discuss how in-silico drug repurposing has the promise to shortly improve our arsenal of anticancer drugs and, likely, overcome certain limitations of modern cancer therapies against old and new therapeutic targets in oncology.

Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are imperative for identifying and managing infected individuals, contact tracing, epidemiologic characterization, and public health decision making. Laboratory testing may be performed based on symptomatic presentation or for screening of asymptomatic people. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), which requires specialized equipment and training and may be particularly challenging in resource-limited settings. NAAT may give false-negative results due to timing of sample collection relative to infection, improper sampling of respiratory specimens, inadequate preservation of samples, and technical limitations; false-positives may occur due to technical errors, particularly contamination during the manual real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) process. Thus, clinical presentation, contact history and contemporary phyloepidemiology must be considered when interpreting results. Several sample-to-answer platforms, including high-throughput systems and Point of Care (PoC) assays, have been developed to increase testing capacity and decrease technical errors. Alternatives to RT-PCR assay, such as other RNA detection methods and antigen tests may be appropriate for certain situations, such as resource-limited settings. While sequencing is important to monitor on-going evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, antibody assays are useful for epidemiologic purposes. The ever-expanding assortment of tests, with varying clinical utility, performance requirements, and limitations, merits comparative evaluation. We herein provide a comprehensive review of currently available COVID-19 diagnostics, exploring their pros and cons as well as appropriate indications. Strategies to further optimize safety, speed, and ease of SARS-CoV-2 testing without compromising accuracy are suggested. Access to scalable diagnostic tools and continued technologic advances, including machine learning and smartphone integration, will facilitate control of the current pandemic as well as preparedness for the next one.

J	Chai, D; Newsam, S; Zhang, HKK; Qiu, Y; Huang, JF				Chai, Dengfeng; Newsam, Shawn; Zhang, Hankui K.; Qiu, Yifan; Huang, Jingfeng			Cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery based on deep convolutional neural networks	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Cloud detection; Semantic segmentation; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Landsat	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; AUTOMATED CLOUD; COVER ASSESSMENT; CLASSIFICATION	This paper formulates cloud and cloud shadow detection as a semantic segmentation problem and proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to detect them in Landsat imagery. Different from traditional machine learning methods, deep CNN-based methods convolve the entire input image to extract multi-level spatial and spectral features, and then deconvolve these features to produce the detailed segmentation. In this way, multi-level features from the whole image and all the bands are utilized to label each pixel as cloud, thin cloud, cloud shadow or clear. An adaption of SegNet with 13 convolutional layers and 13 deconvolution layers is proposed in this study. The method is applied to 38 Landsat 7 images and 32 Landsat 8 images which are globally distributed and have pixel-wise cloud and cloud shadow reference masks provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). In order to process such large images using the adapted SegNet model on a desktop computer, the Landsat Collection 1 scenes are split into non-overlapping 512 * 512 30 m pixel image blocks. 60% of these blocks are used to train the model using the backpropagation algorithm, 10% of the blocks are used to validate the model and tune its parameters, and the remaining 30% of the blocks are used for performance evaluation. Compared with the cloud and cloud shadow masks produced by CFMask, which are provided with the Landsat Collection 1 data, the overall accuracies are significantly improved from 89.88% and 84.58% to 95.26% and 95.47% for the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images respectively. The proposed method benefits from the multi-level spatial and spectral features, and results in more than a 40% increase in user's accuracy and in more than a 20% increase in producer's accuracy for cloud shadow detection in Landsat 8 imagery. The issues for operational implementation are discussed.

Performance of a Genomic Sequencing Classifier for the Preoperative Diagnosis of Cytologically Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules	JAMA SURGERY			English	Article							FINE-NEEDLE-ASPIRATION; GENE-EXPRESSION CLASSIFIER; FOLLICULAR VARIANT; NUCLEAR FEATURES; BETHESDA SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; CANCER; RISK; CYTOPATHOLOGY; METAANALYSIS	IMPORTANCE Use of next-generation sequencing of RNA and machine learning algorithms can classify the risk of malignancy in cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules to limit unnecessary diagnostic surgery. OBJECTIVE To measure the performance of a genomic sequencing classifier for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A blinded validation studywas conducted on a set of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules collected by fine-needle aspiration biopsy between June 2009 and December 2010 from 49 academic and community centers in the United States. All patients underwent surgery without genomic information and were assigned a histopathology diagnosis by an expert panel blinded to all genomic information. There were 210 potentially eligible thyroid biopsy samples with Bethesda III or IV indeterminate cytopathology that constituted a cohort previously used to validate the gene expression classifier. Of these, 191 samples (91.0%) had adequate residual RNA for validation of the genomic sequencing classifier. Algorithm development and independent validation occurred between August 2016 and May 2017. EXPOSURES Thyroid nodule surgical histopathology diagnosis by an expert panel blinded to all genomic data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end pointwas measurement of genomic sequencing classifier sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values in biopsies from Bethesda III and IV nodules. The secondary end point was measurement of classifier performance in biopsies from Bethesda II, V, and VI nodules. RESULTS Of the 183 included patients, 142 (77.6%) were women, and the mean (range) age was 51.7 (22.0-85.0) years. The genomic sequencing classifier had a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 79-98) and a specificity of 68%(95% CI, 60-76). At 24% cancer prevalence, the negative predictive value was 96%(95% CI, 90-99) and the positive predictive value was 47%(95% CI, 36-58). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The genomic sequencing classifier demonstrates high sensitivity and accuracy for identifying benign nodules. Its 36% increase in specificity compared with the gene expression classifier potentially increases the number of patients with benign nodules who can safely avoid unnecessary diagnostic surgery.

J	Ding, S; Li, RJ; Tao, Z				Ding, Song; Li, Ruojin; Tao, Zui			A novel adaptive discrete grey model with time-varying parameters for long-term photovoltaic power generation forecasting	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptive discrete grey model; Genetic algorithm; Long-term forecasting; Photovoltaic power generation	NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION; CONSUMPTION; STORAGE	The rapidly growing photovoltaic power generation (PPG) instigates stochastic volatility of electricity supply that may compromise the power grid's stability and increase the grid imbalance cost. Therefore, accurate predictions of long-term PPG are of essential importance for the capacity deployment, plan improvement, consumption enhancement, and grid balance in systems with high penetration levels of PPG. Artificial neuron networks (ANNs) have been widely utilized to forecast the short-term PPG due to their strong nonlinear fitting competence that corresponds to the prerequisite for handling PPG samples characterized by volatility and nonlinearity. However, under the circumstances of the large time span, the insufficient data samples, and the periodicity existing in the long-term PPG datasets, the ANNs are easily stuck in overfitting and generate large forecasting deviations. Given this situation, a novel discrete grey model with time-varying parameters is initially designed to deal with various PPG time series featured with nonlinearity, periodicity, and volatility, which widely exist in the long-term PPG sequences. To be specific, improvements in this proposed model lie in the following aspects: first, the time-power item and periodic item are designated to compose the time-varying parameters to capture the nonlinear, periodic, and fluctuant developing trends of various time series. Second, owing to the complex nonlinear relationships between the above parameters and forecasting errors, the genetic algorithm applies shortcuts to seek optimum solutions and thereby enhances the prediction precision. Third, several practical properties of the proposed model are elaborated to further interpret the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed model. In experiments, a range of machine learning methods, autoregression models, and grey models are involved for comparisons to validate the feasibility and efficacy of the novel model, through the observations of the PPG in America and China. Finally, a superlative performance of the proposed model with the highest forecasting precision, small volatility of empirical results, and generalizability are confirmed by the aforementioned cases.

The only recent available country-wide LC map of Iran was generated in 2016 by the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with a considerably low accuracy. Therefore, the production of an up-to-date and accurate Iran-wide LC map using the most recent remote sensing, machine learning, and big data processing algorithms is required. Moreover, it is important to develop an efficient method for automatic LC generation for various time periods without the need to collect additional ground truth data from this immense country. Therefore, this study was conducted to fulfill two objectives. First, an improved Iranian LC map with 13 LC classes and a spatial resolution of 10 m was produced using multi-temporal synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets applied to an object-based Random forest (RF) algorithm. For this purpose, 2,869 Sentinel-1 and 11,994 Sentinel-2 scenes acquired in 2017 were processed and classified within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform allowing big geospatial data analysis. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) of the final Iran-wide LC map for 2017 was 95.6% and 0.95, respectively, indicating the considerable potential of the proposed big data processing method. Second, an efficient automatic method was developed based on Sentinel-2 images to migrate ground truth samples from a reference year to automatically generate an LC map for any target year. The OA and KC for the LC map produced for the target year 2019 were 91.35% and 0.91, respectively, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method for automatic LC mapping. Based on the obtained accuracies, this method can potentially be applied to other regions of interest for LC mapping without the need for ground truth data from the target year.

The Zwicky Transient Facility: Data Processing, Products, and Archive	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						astronomical databases: miscellaneous; catalogs; methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric	PHOTOMETRY	The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a new robotic time-domain survey currently in progress using the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt Telescope. ZTF uses a 47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera to scan the entire northern visible sky at rates of similar to 3760 square degrees/hour to median depths of g similar to 20.8 and r similar to 20.6 mag (AB, 5 sigma in 30 sec). We describe the Science Data System that is housed at IPAC, Caltech. This comprises the data-processing pipelines, alert production system, data archive, and user interfaces for accessing and analyzing the products. The real-time pipeline employs a novel image-differencing algorithm, optimized for the detection of point-source transient events. These events are vetted for reliability using a machine-learned classifier and combined with contextual information to generate data-rich alert packets. The packets become available for distribution typically within 13 minutes (95th percentile) of observation. Detected events are also linked to generate candidate moving-object tracks using a novel algorithm. Objects that move fast enough to streak in the individual exposures are also extracted and vetted. We present some preliminary results of the calibration performance delivered by the real-time pipeline. The reconstructed astrometric accuracy per science image with respect to Gaia DR1 is typically 45 to 85 milliarcsec. This is the RMS per-axis on the sky for sources extracted with photometric S/N >= 10 and hence corresponds to the typical astrometric uncertainty down to this limit. The derived photometric precision (repeatability) at bright unsaturated fluxes varies between 8 and 25 millimag. The high end of these ranges corresponds to an airmass approaching similar to 2-the limit of the public survey. Photometric calibration accuracy with respect to Pan-STARRS1 is generally better than 2%. The products support a broad range of scientific applications: fast and young supernovae; rare flux transients; variable stars; eclipsing binaries; variability from active galactic nuclei;counterparts to gravitational wave sources; a more complete census of Type Ia supernovae; and solar-system objects.

The multilevel thresholding method is more efficient for segmenting digital mammograms compared to the classic bi-level thresholding since it uses a higher number of intensities to represent different regions in the image. In the literature, there are different techniques for multilevel segmentation; however, most of these approaches do not obtain good segmented images. In addition, they are computationally expensive. Recently, statistical criteria such as Otsu, Kapur, and cross-entropy have been utilized in combination with evolutionary and swarm-based strategies to investigate the optimal threshold values for multilevel segmentation. In this paper, an efficient methodology for multilevel segmentation is proposed using the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm and the minimum cross-entropy as a fitness function. To substantiate the results and effectiveness of the HHO-based method, it has been tested over a benchmark set of reference images, with the Berkeley segmentation database, and with medical images of digital mammography. The proposed HHO-based solver is verified based on other comparable optimizers and two machine learning algorithms K-means and the Fuzzy IterAg. The comparisons were performed based on three groups. This first one is to provide evidence of the optimization capabilities of the HHO using the Wilcoxon test, and the second is to verify segmented image quality using the PSNR, SSIM, and FSIM metrics. Then, the third way is to verify the segmented image comparing it with the ground-truth through the metrics PRI, GCE, and VoI. The experimental results, which are validated by statistical analysis, show that the introduced method produces efficient and reliable results in terms of quality, consistency, and accuracy in comparison with the other methods. This HHO-based method presents an improvement over other segmentation approaches that are currently used in the literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Melo-Merino, SM; Reyes-Bonilla, H; Lira-Noriega, A				Melo-Merino, Sara M.; Reyes-Bonilla, Hector; Lira-Noriega, Andres			Ecological niche models and species distribution models in marine environments: A literature review and spatial analysis of evidence	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Review						Biogeography; Coastal; Correlative modelling; Geographic distribution; Ocean; Process-based modelling; Sea; Suitability	PREDICTING SUITABLE HABITAT; EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC; CORAL LOPHELIA-PERTUSA; WATER GORGONIAN CORALS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-ATLANTIC; PROTECTED AREAS; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; RANGE SHIFTS; BALTIC SEA	In recent years, the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) and species distribution models (SDMs) to explore the patterns and processes behind observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth. Although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context, they have shown significant increases in use and applications. Herein, we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine ENMs and SDMs published between 1990 and 2016, aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed, including spatial scale, geographic realm, taxonomic groups assessed, algorithms implemented, and data sources. Of the 328 studies, 48 % were at local scales, with a hotspot of research effort in the North Atlantic Ocean. Most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges (64 %). A few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change (19 %) or to develop strategies for conservation (11 %). Several correlative techniques have been used, but most common was the machine-learning approach Maxent (46 %) and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models GAMS (22 %) and generalized linear models, GLMs (14 %). The groups most studied were fish (23 %), molluscs (16 %), and marine mammals (14 %), the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation. We noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of ENMs versus SDMs, and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them. This review exposed a need to know, reduce, and report error and uncertainty associated with species' occurrence records and environmental data. In addition, particular to marine realms, a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process, referring to the vertical position of the species, which will improve the precision and utility of these models. So too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems, especially in the case of highly mobile species.

Whether using one-slice 2D annotation or whole-volume 3D annotation remains a long-time debate, especially for heterogeneous GC. We comprehensively compared 2D and 3D radiomic features' representation and discrimination capacity regarding GC, via three tasks (T-LNM, lymph node metastasis' prediction; T-LVI, lymphovascular invasion's prediction; T-pT, pT4 or other pT stages' classification). Methods: Four-center 539 GC patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into the training and validation cohorts. From 2D or 3D regions of interest (ROIs) annotated by radiologists, radiomic features were extracted respectively. Feature selection and model construction procedures were customed for each combination of two modalities (2D or 3D) and three tasks. Subsequently, six machine learning models (Model(2D)(LNM), Model(3D)(LNM); Model(2D)(LVI), Model(3D)(LVI); Model(2D)(pT), Model(3D)(pT)) were derived and evaluated to reflect modalities' performances in characterizing GC. Furthermore, we performed an auxiliary experiment to assess modalities' performances when resampling spacing different. Results: Regarding three tasks, the yielded areas under the curve (AUCs) were: Model(2D)(LNM)'s 0.712 (95% confidence interval, 0.613-0.811), Model(3D)(LNM)'s 0.680 (0.584-0.775); Model(2D)(LVI)'s 0.677 (0.595-0.761), Model(3D)(LVI)'s 0.615 (0.528-0.703); Model(2D)(pT)'s 0.840 (0.779-0.901), Model(3D)(pT)'s 0.813 (0.747-0.879). Moreover, the auxiliary experiment indicated that Models(2D) are statistically advantageous than Models(3D) with different resampling spacings. Conclusion: Models constructed with 2D radiomic features revealed comparable performances with those constructed with 3D features in characterizing GC. Significance: Our work indicated that time-saving 2D annotation would be the better choice in GC, and provided a related reference to further radiomics-based researches.

Methods We obtained the texts of countries'annual statements in United Nations (UN) general debates from 2000 to 2019 and their nationally determined contributions at the Paris Agreement in 2016. To measure countries' engagement, we used a keyword-in-context text search with relevant search terms to count the total number of references to the relationship of health to climate change. We used a machine learning model (random forest predictions) to identify the most important country-level predictors of engagement. The predictors included political and economic factors, health outcomes, climate change-related variables and membership of political negotiating groups in the UN. Findings For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low-and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption. Membership of political negotiating groups (such as the Group of 77 and Small Island Developing States) was a less important predictor. Conclusion Our analysis indicated a higher engagement in countries that carry the heaviest climate-related health burdens, but lack necessary resources to address the impacts of climate change. These countries are shouldering responsibility for reminding the global community of the implications of climate change for people's health. Climate change is taking an increasing toll on people's health. The increase in heatwaves, drought, floods and other climate hazards is increasing the risk of climate-related illness and death as well as reversing gains made in reducing food insecurity and global hunger.1,2 Air pollution, primarily driven by fossil fuel emissions, is the major environmental risk factor for premature death and has impacts on child health and survival.3-5 Highlighting these human impacts is seen as a way of accelerating climate action,	[Jin, Huajie; Pennington, Mark] Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr, Box 024, London SE5 8AF, England; [Wang, Haiyin] Shanghai Hlth Dev Res Ctr, Hlth Technol Assessment Res Dept, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiao] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis, Antwerp, Belgium; [Zheng, Weiwei] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ye, Shanke] Shanghai Publ Hlth Clin Ctr, Dept Infect Dis, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Sheng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jiahui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia		Jin, HJ (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, David Goldberg Ctr, Box 024, London SE5 8AF, England.	huajie.jin@kcl.ac.uk			Fourth Round of the Shanghai Three-year Action Plan on Public Health Discipline and Talent Program: Evidence-based Public Health and Health Economics [15GWZK0901]	Fourth Round of the Shanghai Three-year Action Plan on Public Health Discipline and Talent Program: Evidence-based Public Health and Health Economics	We received no funding for this research.

Numerous software packages exist that allow users to model ecological niches using machine learning and statistical methods. However, no existing package with a graphical user interface allows users to perform model calibration and selection based on convex forms such as ellipsoids, which may match fundamental ecological niche shapes better, incorporating tools for exploring, modelling, and evaluating niches and distributions that are intuitive for both novice and proficient users. Here we describe anrpackage, NicheToolBox(ntbox), that allows users to conduct all processing steps involved in ecological niche modelling: downloading and curating occurrence data, obtaining and transforming environmental data layers, selecting environmental variables, exploring relationships between geographic and environmental spaces, calibrating and selecting ellipsoid models, evaluating models using binomial and partial ROC tests, assessing extrapolation risk, and performing geographic information system operations via a graphical user interface. A summary of the entire workflow is produced for use as a stand-alone algorithm or as part of research reports. The method is explained in detail and tested via modelling the threatened feline speciesLeopardus wiedii. Georeferenced occurrence data for this species are queried to display both point occurrences and the IUCN extent of occurrence polygon (IUCN, 2007). This information is used to illustrate tools available for accessing, processing and exploring biodiversity data (e.g. number of occurrences and chronology of collecting) and transforming environmental data (e.g. a summary PCA for 19 bioclimatic layers). Visualizations of three-dimensional ecological niches modelled as minimum volume ellipsoids are developed with ancillary statistics. This niche model is then projected to geographic space, to represent a corresponding potential suitability map. Usingntboxallows a fast and straightforward means by which to retrieve and manipulate occurrence and environmental data, which can then be implemented in model calibration, projection and evaluation for assessing distributions of species in geographic space and their corresponding environmental combinations.

Approach and Results In this phase 2b trial, 392 patients with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis (F3-F4) were randomized to receive placebo, selonsertib 18 mg, cilofexor 30 mg, or firsocostat 20 mg, alone or in two-drug combinations, once-daily for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was a >= 1-stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH between baseline and 48 weeks based on central pathologist review. Exploratory endpoints included changes in NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), liver histology assessed using a machine learning (ML) approach, liver biochemistry, and noninvasive markers. The majority had cirrhosis (56%) and NAS >= 5 (83%). The primary endpoint was achieved in 11% of placebo-treated patients versus cilofexor/firsocostat (21%; P = 0.17), cilofexor/selonsertib (19%; P = 0.26), firsocostat/selonsertib (15%; P = 0.62), firsocostat (12%; P = 0.94), and cilofexor (12%; P = 0.96). Changes in hepatic collagen by morphometry were not significant, but cilofexor/firsocostat led to a significant decrease in ML NASH CRN fibrosis score (P = 0.040) and a shift in biopsy area from F3-F4 to <= F2 fibrosis patterns. Compared to placebo, significantly higher proportions of cilofexor/firsocostat patients had a >= 2-point NAS reduction; reductions in steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning; and significant improvements in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, bile acids, cytokeratin-18, insulin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, ELF score, and liver stiffness by transient elastography (all P <= 0.05). Pruritus occurred in 20%-29% of cilofexor versus 15% of placebo-treated patients. Conclusions In patients with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis, 48 weeks of cilofexor/firsocostat was well tolerated, led to improvements in NASH activity, and may have an antifibrotic effect. This combination offers potential for fibrosis regression with longer-term therapy in patients with advanced fibrosis attributable to NASH.

Tuning metal single atoms embedded in NxCy moieties toward high-performance electrocatalysis	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; OXYGEN REDUCTION; EFFICIENT; CATALYSTS; DESIGN; COORDINATION; CHALLENGES; TRENDS; SITES	Noble nanoparticle (NP)-sized electrocatalysts have been exploited for diverse electrochemical reactions, in particular, for an eco-friendly hydrogen economy such as water splitting. Recently, minimal amounts of single atoms (SAs) are exploited to maximize the active surface area and to tune the catalytic activity by coordinating the SAs in defect sites of N-doped graphene (G(N)). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), we show high-performance 3d-5d transition metal (TM) SA catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) along with machine learning (ML)-based descriptors. We explore the stability and activity of TM-G(N) from the view of structure/coordination, formation energy, structural/electrochemical stability, electronic properties, electrical conductivity, and reaction mechanism, which have not been seriously explored yet. Among various -NnCm moieties, the -N2C2 moieties tend to be more easily formed and show higher electrochemical catalytic performance and longer durability (without aggregation/dissolution) compared with the widely studied pure -C-4/C-3 and -N-4/N-3 moieties. We found that some TM(SA)s favor a new OER/ORR mechanism, completely different from any known mechanism. The ML-based descriptors showing super HER/OER/ORR performances better than those of bench-mark noble metal catalysts are assessed. In the N2C2 templates, Ni/Ru/Rh/Pt show low HER overpotentials. Here, the H adsorption sites are shared by both the metal and C (not N), which was undiscussed in most of the previous literature where the H is attached on top of a metal atom. Low OER overpotentials are found for Pt/Ni-N2C2, Ni/Pd-C-4, and Rh-N-4, while low ORR overpotentials are found for Ir/Rh-N-4, Pd-C-4, Ru-N3C1 and Ni/Pd/Pt-N1C3. The present findings should help in designing high-performance SA catalysts for other various electrocatalytic reactions such as the ammonia evolution reaction.

The selected secondary metabolites have been experimentally validated and reported as potent antiviral agents against genetically-close human viruses. The plants have also been used as a folk medicine to treat cold, cough, asthma, bronchitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome in India and across the globe since time immemorial. The present study aimed to assess the repurposing possibility of potent antiviral compounds with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and also with host-specific receptor and activator protease that facilitates the viral entry into the host body. Molecular docking (MDc) was performed to study molecular affinities of antiviral compounds with aforesaid target proteins. The top-scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further validated by 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation run. The stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Finally, the binding affinities of all the compounds were also compared with a reference ligand, remdesivir, against the target protein RdRp. Additionally, pharmacophore features, 3D structure alignment of potent compounds and Bayesian machine learning model were also used to support the MDc and MD simulation. Overall, the study emphasized that curcumin possesses a strong binding ability with host-specific receptors, furin and ACE2. In contrast, gingerol has shown strong interactions with spike protein, and RdRp and quercetin with main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, all these target proteins play an essential role in mediating viral replication, and therefore, compounds targeting aforesaid target proteins are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. Overall, gingerol, curcumin and quercetin own multitarget binding ability that can be used alone or in combination to enhance therapeutic efficacy against COVID-19. The obtained results encourage further in vitro and in vivo investigations and also support the traditional use of antiviral plants preventively.

Cirrhosis regression is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis	HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							FATTY LIVER-DISEASE	Background and Aims Surrogate endpoints that predict complications are necessary for assessment and approval of NASH therapies. We assessed associations between histologic and noninvasive tests (NITs) of fibrosis with liver-related complications in patients with NASH cirrhosis. Approach and Results Patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH were enrolled in two placebo-controlled trials of simtuzumab and selonsertib. Liver fibrosis at baseline and week 48 (W48) was staged by NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) and Ishak classifications and a machine learning (ML) approach, hepatic collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression were quantified by morphometry, liver stiffness (LS) was measured by transient elastography, and serum NITs (enhanced liver fibrosis [ELF], NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS], and Fibrosis-4 index [FIB-4]) were calculated. Cox regression determined associations between these parameters at baseline and their changes over time with adjudicated liver-related clinical events. Among 1,135 patients, 709 (62%) had Ishak stage 6 fibrosis, and median ELF and LS were 10.66 and 21.1 kPa, respectively. During a median follow-up of 16.6 months, 71 (6.3%) had a liver-related event; associated baseline factors included Ishak stage 6 fibrosis, and higher hepatic collagen, alpha-SMA expression, ML-based fibrosis parameters, LS, ELF, NFS, and FIB-4. Cirrhosis regression observed in 16% (176/1,135) between BL and W48 was associated with a lower risk of events versus nonregression (1.1% [2/176] vs. 7.2% [69/957]; HR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04, 0.65 [p = 0.0104]). Conversely, after adjustment for baseline values, increases in hepatic collagen, alpha-SMA, ML-based fibrosis parameters, NFS, and LS were associated with an increased risk of events. Conclusions In patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH, regression of fibrosis is associated with a reduction in liver-related complications. These data support the utility of histologic fibrosis regression and NITs as clinical trial endpoints for NASH cirrhosis.

In this paper we review that paradigm and summarize its key lessons, which include the valence of this phenotype for future psychosis outcomes, but also for comorbid, persistent or incident non-psychotic disorders; and the evidence that onset of psychotic disorder can at least be delayed in ultra high risk (UHR) patients, and that some full-threshold psychotic disorder may emerge from risk states not captured by UHR criteria. The paradigm has also illuminated risk factors and mechanisms involved in psychosis onset. However, findings from this and related paradigms indicate the need to develop new identification and diagnostic strategies. These findings include the high prevalence and impact of mental disorders in young people, the limitations of current diagnostic systems and risk identification approaches, the diffuse and unstable symptom patterns in early stages, and their pluripotent, transdiagnostic trajectories. The approach we have recently adopted has been guided by the clinical staging model and adapts the original at risk mental state approach to encompass a broader range of inputs and output target syndromes. This approach is supported by a number of novel modelling and prediction strategies that acknowledge and reflect the dynamic nature of psychopathology, such as dynamical systems theory, network theory, and joint modelling. Importantly, a broader transdiagnostic approach and enhancing specific prediction (profiling or increasing precision) can be achieved concurrently. A holistic strategy can be developed that applies these new prediction approaches, as well as machine learning and iterative probabilistic multimodal models, to a blend of subjective psychological data, physical disturbances (e.g., EEG measures) and biomarkers (e.g., neuroinflammation, neural network abnormalities) acquired through fine-grained sequential or longitudinal assessments. This strategy could ultimately enhance our understanding and ability to predict the onset, early course and evolution of mental ill health, further opening pathways for preventive interventions.

This paper presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is scalable to large (N greater than or similar to 10(6)) networks and can be operated at high (gigahertz) speeds and very low (subattojoule) energies per multiply and accumulate (MAC), using the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit and image classification reveal a "standard quantum limit" for optical neural networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as 50 zJ/MAC, suggests that performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The proposed accelerator can implement both fully connected and convolutional networks. We also present a scheme for backpropagation and training that can be performed in the same hardware. This architecture will enable a new class of ultralow-energy processors for deep learning.

J	Sarmadi, H; Karamodin, A				Sarmadi, Hassan; Karamodin, Abbas			A novel anomaly detection method based on adaptive Mahalanobis-squared distance and one-class kNN rule for structural health monitoring under environmental effects	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Structural health monitoring; Environmental effects; Adaptive Mahalanobis-squared distance; K-nearest neighbor; Novelty detection; Generalized extreme value	STATISTICAL PATTERN-RECOGNITION; NEAREST NEIGHBOR RULE; CARLO DATA GENERATION; DAMAGE DETECTION; FAULT-DETECTION; NORMALITY; ALGORITHMS; MACHINE; MODELS	Anomaly detection by Mahalanobis-squared distance (MSD) is a popular unsupervised learning approach to structural health monitoring (SHM). Despite the popularity and high applicability of the MSD-based anomaly detection method, some major challenging issues and limitations such as environmental variability, determination of an inappropriate threshold limit, estimation of an inaccurate covariance matrix, and non-Gaussianity of training data may lead to false alarms and erroneous results of damage detection. The main objective of this article is to propose a novel anomaly detection method based on adaptive Mahalanobis-squared distance and one-class kNN rule called AMSD-kNN for SHM under varying environmental conditions. The central idea behind the proposed method is to find sufficient nearest neighbors of training and testing datasets in a two-stage procedure for removing the environmental variability conditions and estimate local covariance matrices. An effective approach based on a multivariate normality hypothesis test is proposed to find sufficient nearest neighbors that guarantee the estimate of well-conditioned local covariance matrices. The great novelty of the proposed AMSD-kNN method is to create a novel unsupervised learning strategy for SHM by a new multivariate distance measure and one-class kNN rule. Generalized extreme value distribution modeling by the block maxima (BM) method is presented to determine an accurate threshold limit. Due to the importance of choosing adequate blocks in the BM method, a goodness-of-fit measure via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test is applied to select an optimal block number. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified by two well-known benchmark structures. Several comparative studies are also conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over some state-of-the-art techniques. Results show that the proposed AMSD-kNN and BM methods highly succeed in detecting damage under environmental variability conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This approach does not explicitly represent high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image features to text. In this paper we first propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering. We further show that the same mechanism can be used to incorporate external knowledge, which is critically important for answering high level visual questions. Specifically, we design a visual question answering model that combines an internal representation of the content of an image with information extracted from a general knowledge base to answer a broad range of image-based questions. It particularly allows questions to be asked where the image alone does not contain the information required to select the appropriate answer. Our final model achieves the best reported results for both image captioning and visual question answering on several of the major benchmark datasets.

Online Social Networks (OSNs) can be efficiently managed by monitoring users' behaviors within a cohesive social group represented by a maximal clique. They can further provide valued social intelligence for their users. Maximal Cliques Problem (MCP) as a fundamental problem in graph mining and analysis is to identify the maximal cliques in a graph. Existing studies on MCP mainly focus on static graphs, with less attention on the detection and dynamic evolution of maximal cliques in OSNs. To fill this gap, we adopt the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) theory to represent and analyze social networks. We then develop two novel formal concepts generation algorithms, termed Add-FCA and Dec-FCA, that can be applicable to OSNs for detecting the maximal cliques and characterizing the dynamic evolution process of maximal cliques in OSNs. Extensive experimental results are conducted to investigate and demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results reveal that our algorithms can efficiently capture and manage the evolutionary patterns of maximal cliques, including unchanged, changed, added, and vanished maximal cliques in OSNs, and a quantitative relation among them is presented. In addition, an illustrative example is presented to verify the usefulness of the proposed approach.

We aimed to develop and independently validate a radiomics-based biomarker of tumour-infiltrating CD8 cells in patients included in phase 1 trials of anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 or anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy. We also aimed to evaluate the association between the biomarker, and tumour immune phenotype and clinical outcomes of these patients. Methods In this retrospective multicohort study, we used four independent cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumours to develop and validate a radiomic signature predictive of immunotherapy response by combining contrast-enhanced CT images and RNA-seq genomic data from tumour biopsies to assess CD8 cell tumour infiltration. To develop the radiomic signature of CD8 cells, we used the CT images and RNA sequencing data of 135 patients with advanced solid malignant tumours who had been enrolled into the MOSCATO trial between May 1, 2012, and March 31, 2016, in France (training set). The genomic data, which are based on the CD8B gene, were used to estimate the abundance of CD8 cells in the samples and data were then aligned with the images to generate the radiomic signatures. The concordance of the radiomic signature (primary endpoint) was validated in a Cancer Genome Atlas [TGCA] database dataset including 119 patients who had available baseline preoperative imaging data and corresponding transcriptomic data on June 30, 2017. From 84 input variables used for the machine-learning method (78 radiomic features, five location variables, and one technical variable), a radiomics-based predictor of the CD8 cell expression signature was built by use of machine learning (elastic-net regularised regression method). Two other independent cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumours were used to evaluate this predictor. The immune phenotype internal cohort (n=100), were randomly selected from the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus database of patient medical records based on previously described, extreme tumour-immune phenotypes: immune-inflamed (with dense CD8 cell infiltration) or immune-desert (with low CD8 cell infiltration), irrespective of treatment delivered; these data were used to analyse the correlation of the immune phenotype with this biomarker. Finally, the immunotherapy-treated dataset (n=137) of patients recruited from Dec 1, 2011, to Jan 31, 2014, at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, who had been treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in phase 1 trials, was used to assess the predictive value of this biomarker in terms of clinical outcome. Findings We developed a radiomic signature for CD8 cells that included eight variables, which was validated with the gene expression signature of CD8 cells in the TCGA dataset (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.67; 95% CI 0.57-0.77; p = 0.0019). In the cohort with assumed immune phenotypes, the signature was also able to discriminate inflamed tumours from immune-desert tumours (0.76; 0.66-0.86; p < 0.0001). In patients treated with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1, a high baseline radiomic score (relative to the median) was associated with a higher proportion of patients who achieved an objective response at 3 months (vs those with progressive disease or stable disease; p = 0.049) and a higher proportion of patients who had an objective response (vs those with progressive disease or stable disease; p = 0.025) or stable disease (vs those with progressive disease; p = 0.013) at 6 months. A high baseline radiomic score was also associated with improved overall survival in univariate (median overall survival 24.3 months in the high radiomic score group, 95% CI 18.63-42.1; vs 11.5 months in the low radiomic score group, 7.98-15.6; hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.39 - 0.87; p = 0.0081) and multivariate analyses (0 .52, 0.35 - 0.79; p = 0.0022). Interpretation The radiomic signature of CD8 cells was validated in three independent cohorts. This imaging predictor provided a promising way to predict the immune phenotype of tumours and to infer clinical outcomes for patients with cancer who had been treated with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1. Our imaging biomarker could be useful in estimating CD8 cell count and predicting clinical outcomes of patients treated with immunotherapy, when validated by further prospective randomised trials.

J	Eren, L; Ince, T; Kiranyaz, S				Eren, Levent; Ince, Turker; Kiranyaz, Serkan			A Generic Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis System Using Compact Adaptive 1D CNN Classifier	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bearing fault detection; Intelligent systems; Convolutional neural networks	DAMAGE DETECTION; SIGNAL; DECOMPOSITION; MACHINES; MODEL	Timely and accurate bearing fault detection and diagnosis is important for reliable and safe operation of industrial systems. In this study, performance of a generic real-time induction bearing fault diagnosis system employing compact adaptive 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is extensively studied. In the literature, although many studies have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting bearing faults, their results have generally been limited to relatively small train/test data sets. As opposed to conventional intelligent fault diagnosis systems that usually encapsulate feature extraction, feature selection and classification as distinct blocks, the proposed system takes directly raw time-series sensor data as input and it can efficiently learn optimal features with the proper training. The main advantages of the 1D CNN based approach are 1) its compact architecture configuration (rather than the complex deep architectures) which performs only 1D convolutions making it suitable for real-time fault detection and monitoring, 2) its cost effective and practical real-time hardware implementation, 3) its ability to work without any pre-determined transformation (such as FFT or DWT), hand-crafted feature extraction and feature selection, and 4) its capability to provide efficient training of the classifier with limited size of training data set and limited number of BP iterations. Effectiveness and feasibility of the 1D CNN based fault diagnosis method is validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark real vibration data sets and comparing the results with the other competing intelligent fault diagnosis methods.

Recently, graph theory has been applied to spectrum analysis to improve the performance of feature extraction. By converting the raw data into graphs, hidden structural and topological information can be obtained. In this article, a spatial-temporal graph-based feature extraction, called SuperGraph, for rotating machinery fault diagnosis is proposed. Specifically, graph theory-based spectrum analysis is used to construct the spatial-temporal graph. Then, the Laplacian matrix-based feature vector is extracted from the constructed spatial-temporal graph. By this means, the spatial-temporal graph is converted into the one-dimensional (1-D) vector for further constructing SuperGraph, where each node of the SuperGraph represents a spatial-temporal graph and the SuperGraph is composed of many local graphs. In the local graph, only the same type of nodes are connected to form a fully connected graph. Thus, the task of graph classification can be transformed into classifying the nodes in the SuperGraph. After graph convolutional network is established for learning and obtaining deep features, the label of nodes is identified from a soft m (LE model. Experiments are conducted on two benchmarking datasets and a practical experimental platform to verify effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method.

To increase the feasibility and wearability of EmotionMeter in real-world applications, we design a six-electrode placement above the ears to collect electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We combine EEG and eye movements for integrating the internal cognitive states and external subconscious behaviors of users to improve the recognition accuracy of EmotionMeter. The experimental results demonstrate that modality fusion with multimodal deep neural networks can significantly enhance the performance compared with a single modality, and the best mean accuracy of 85.11% is achieved for four emotions (happy, sad, fear, and neutral). We explore the complementary characteristics of EEG and eye movements for their representational capacities and identify that EEG has the advantage of classifying happy emotion, whereas eye movements outperform EEG in recognizing fear emotion. To investigate the stability of EmotionMeter over time, each subject performs the experiments three times on different days.

Digital technology, tele-medicine and artificial intelligence in ophthalmology: A global perspective	PROGRESS IN RETINAL AND EYE RESEARCH			English	Review						Telemedicine; Tele-ophthalmology; Tele-screening; Diabetic retinopathy screening; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Digital transformation; Digital innovations; COVID-19; Digital technology	PHILADELPHIA GLAUCOMA DETECTION; MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS; STANFORD-UNIVERSITY NETWORK; NATIONAL SCREENING-PROGRAM; IMAGE ASSESSMENT SOFTWARE; VISUAL-FIELD PROGRESSION; MAJOR RISK-FACTORS; PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE; DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; MACULAR DEGENERATION	The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI), 5th generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a "new normal", the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as recommendations on future directions.

J	Griffiths, P; Nendel, C; Pickert, J; Hostert, P				Griffiths, Patrick; Nendel, Claas; Pickert, Juergen; Hostert, Patrick			Towards national-scale characterization of grassland use intensity from integrated Sentinel-2 and Landsat time series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Time series analysis; Grassland; Phenology; Compositing; Agriculture; Land use intensity; CAP; Europe	FOOD SECURITY; GREAT-PLAINS; PRECIPITATION; MANAGEMENT; COVER; NDVI	The increased availability of systematically acquired high spatial and temporal resolution optical imagery improves the characterization of dynamic land surface processes such as agriculture. The use of time series phenology can help overcome limitations of conventional classification-based mapping approaches encountered when, for example, attempting to characterize grassland use intensity. In Europe, permanent grasslands account for more than one third of all agricultural land and a considerable share of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is devoted to grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing events is an important proxy for grassland use intensity and methods that allow characterizing grassland use intensity at the parcel level and over large areas are urgently needed. Here we present a novel algorithm that allows detecting and quantifying the number and timing of mowing events in central European grasslands. The algorithm utilizes all imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI for one entire year as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Cloud-free observations from both sensors are first synthesized through compositing at 10-day interval. Machine learning algorithms are then used to derive a grassland stratum. The intra-annual growing season profiles of NDVI values are subsequently assessed and compared to an idealized growing season trajectory. Residuals between the idealized trajectory and a polynomial model fit to the observed NDVI values are then evaluated to detect potential mowing events. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our algorithm and utilize its large area analysis capabilities by mapping the frequency and timing of grassland mowing events in 2016 on the national-scale across Germany. Our results suggest that 25% of the grassland area is not used for mowing. Validation results however suggest a relatively high omission error of the algorithm for areas that only experienced a single mowing event. The date ranges of detected mowing events compare overall well to a sample of interpreted time series points and to farm level reports on mowing dates. The mapped mowing patterns depict typical management regimes across Germany. Overall, our results exemplify the value of multi-sensor time series applications for characterizing land use intensity across large areas.

Vibrational Spectroscopic Map, Vibrational Spectroscopy, and Intermolecular Interaction	CHEMICAL REVIEWS			English	Review							2D IR SPECTROSCOPY; 2-DIMENSIONAL INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; HYDROGEN-BOND DYNAMICS; SOLVATOCHROMIC COMPARISON METHOD; CLASSICAL MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; FREQUENCY GENERATION SPECTROSCOPY; (CD-ALPHA)-D-ALPHA STRETCH MODE; TIME-DOMAIN CALCULATIONS; CARBON-DEUTERIUM BONDS	Vibrational spectroscopy is an essential tool in chemical analyses, biological assays, and studies of functional materials. Over the past decade, various coherent nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic techniques have been developed and enabled researchers to study time-correlations of the fluctuating frequencies that are directly related to solute-solvent dynamics, dynamical changes in molecular conformations and local electrostatic environments, chemical and biochemical reactions, protein structural dynamics and functions, characteristic processes of functional materials, and so on. In order to gain incisive and quantitative information on the local electrostatic environment, molecular conformation, protein structure and interprotein contacts, ligand binding kinetics, and electric and optical properties of functional materials, a variety of vibrational probes have been developed and site-specifically incorporated into molecular, biological, and material systems for time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic investigation. However, still, an all-encompassing theory that describes the vibrational solvatochromism, electrochromism, and dynamic fluctuation of vibrational frequencies has not been completely established mainly due to the intrinsic complexity of intermolecular interactions in condensed phases. In particular, the amount of data obtained from the linear and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic experiments has been rapidly increasing, but the lack of a quantitative method to interpret these measurements has been one major obstacle in broadening the applications of these methods. Among various theoretical models, one of the most successful approaches is a semiempirical model generally referred to as the vibrational spectroscopic map that is based on a rigorous theory of intermolecular interactions. Recently, genetic algorithm, neural network, and machine learning approaches have been applied to the development of vibrational solvatochromism theory. In this review, we provide comprehensive descriptions of the theoretical foundation and various examples showing its extraordinary successes in the interpretations of experimental observations. In addition, a brief introduction to a newly created repository Web site (http://frequencymap.org) for vibrational spectroscopic maps is presented. We anticipate that a combination of the vibrational frequency map approach and state-of-the-art multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy will be one of the most fruitful ways to study the structure and dynamics of chemical, biological, and functional molecular systems in the future.

Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.

Blood vessel segmentation algorithms - Review of methods, datasets and evaluation metrics	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Review						Blood vessels; Medical imaging; Review; Segmentation	ORIENTED FLUX SYMMETRY; ACTIVE CONTOUR MODEL; RETINAL IMAGES; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; LUMEN SEGMENTATION; MINIMAL PATHS; FRONT PROPAGATION; FAST EXTRACTION; LEVEL; QUANTIFICATION	Background: Blood vessel segmentation is a topic of high interest in medical image analysis since the analysis of vessels is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning and execution, and evaluation of clinical outcomes in different fields, including laryngology, neurosurgery and ophthalmology. Automatic or semi-automatic vessel segmentation can support clinicians in performing these tasks. Different medical imaging techniques are currently used in clinical practice and an appropriate choice of the segmentation algorithm is mandatory to deal with the adopted imaging technique characteristics (e.g. resolution, noise and vessel contrast). Objective: This paper aims at reviewing the most recent and innovative blood vessel segmentation algorithms. Among the algorithms and approaches considered, we deeply investigated the most novel blood vessel segmentation including machine learning, deformable model, and tracking-based approaches. Methods: This paper analyzes more than 100 articles focused on blood vessel segmentation methods. For each analyzed approach, summary tables are presented reporting imaging technique used, anatomical region and performance measures employed. Benefits and disadvantages of each method are highlighted. Discussion: Despite the constant progress and efforts addressed in the field, several issues still need to be overcome. A relevant limitation consists in the segmentation of pathological vessels. Unfortunately, not consistent research effort has been addressed to this issue yet. Research is needed since some of the main assumptions made for healthy vessels (such as linearity and circular cross-section) do not hold in pathological tissues, which on the other hand require new vessel model formulations. Moreover, image intensity drops, noise and low contrast still represent an important obstacle for the achievement of a high-quality enhancement. This is particularly true for optical imaging, where the image quality is usually lower in terms of noise and contrast with respect to magnetic resonance and computer tomography angiography. Conclusion: No single segmentation approach is suitable for all the different anatomical region or imaging modalities, thus the primary goal of this review was to provide an up to date source of information about the state of the art of the vessel segmentation algorithms so that the most suitable methods can be chosen according to the specific task.

However, their fixed structures are not flexible enough to address the structural variations triggered by the changing operating conditions or system states in complex industrial environments. A novel generalized heterogeneous interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy classifier, named as GHIT2Class, is proposed in this paper, which is built upon a multivariable IT2 fuzzy neural network. To fully reflect the industrial data characteristics of uncertainty, this paper proposes an approach of constructing the uncertainty footprint with ellipsoidal rotation. A rule pruning method based on error and incentive intensity dynamic adjustment mechanism is reported in the process of modeling, and a corresponding rule recall mechanism is designed to avoid rules of catastrophic forgetting. In addition, the simultaneous update of the upper and lower bounds of IT2 fuzzy consequent parameters is designed to relieve the computing overhead of the fuzzy systems. The performance of the proposed GHIT2Class is experimentally validated by a number of synthetic datasets and industry study cases by using state-of-the-art comparative classifiers, where the proposed approach outperforms the others in achieving the best tradeoff between accuracy and simplicity.

In this paper, we propose to exploit the rich hierarchical features of deep convolutional neural networks to improve the accuracy and robustness of visual tracking. Deep neural networks trained on object recognition datasets consist of multiple convolutional layers. These layers encode target appearance with different levels of abstraction. For example, the outputs of the last convolutional layers encode the semantic information of targets and such representations are invariant to significant appearance variations. However, their spatial resolutions are too coarse to precisely localize the target. In contrast, features from earlier convolutional layers provide more precise localization but are less invariant to appearance changes. We interpret the hierarchical features of convolutional layers as a nonlinear counterpart of an image pyramid representation and explicitly exploit these multiple levels of abstraction to represent target objects. Specifically, we learn adaptive correlation filters on the outputs from each convolutional layer to encode the target appearance. We infer the maximum response of each layer to locate targets in a coarse-to-fine manner. To further handle the issues with scale estimation and re-detecting target objects from tracking failures caused by heavy occlusion or out-of-the-view movement, we conservatively learn another correlation filter, that maintains a long-term memory of target appearance, as a discriminative classifier. We apply the classifier to two types of object proposals: (1) proposals with a small step size and tightly around the estimated location for scale estimation; and (2) proposals with large step size and across the whole image for target re-detection. Extensive experimental results on large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art tracking methods.

J	Tian, Z; Shen, CH; Chen, H; He, T				Tian, Zhi; Shen, Chunhua; Chen, Hao; He, Tong			FCOS: A Simple and Strong Anchor-Free Object Detector	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Object detection; fully convolutional one-stage object detection; anchor box; deep learning		In computer vision, object detection is one of most important tasks, which underpins a few instance-level recognition tasks and many downstream applications. Recently one-stage methods have gained much attention over two-stage approaches due to their simpler design and competitive performance. Here we propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detector (FCOS) to solve object detection in a per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue to other dense prediction problems such as semantic segmentation. Almost all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as calculating the intersection over union (IoU) scores during training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes, which are often sensitive to the final detection performance. With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), we demonstrate a much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving improved detection accuracy. We hope that the proposed FCOS framework can serve as a simple and strong alternative for many other instance-level tasks.

In particular, perspective text and curved text are common in natural scenes and are difficult to recognize. In this work, we introduce ASTER, an end-to-end neural network model that comprises a rectification network and a recognition network. The rectification network adaptively transforms an input image into a new one, rectifying the text in it. It is powered by a flexible Thin-Plate Spline transformation which handles a variety of text irregularities and is trained without human annotations. The recognition network is an attentional sequence-to-sequence model that predicts a character sequence directly from the rectified image. The whole model is trained end to end, requiring only images and their groundtruth text. Through extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the rectification and demonstrate the state-of-the-art recognition performance of ASTER. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ASTER is a powerful component in end-to-end recognition systems, for its ability to enhance the detector.

J	Shen, YN; Tang, JJ; Guo, F				Shen, Yinan; Tang, Jijun; Guo, Fei			Identification of protein subcellular localization via integrating evolutionary and physicochemical information into Chou's general PseAAC	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Protein subcellular localization; Physicochemical; PSSM; Multi-kernel SVM	AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; LABEL LEARNING CLASSIFIER; TOP-DOWN APPROACH; VIRUS PROTEINS; PREDICTION; SINGLE; MPLOC; GO; SITES; PLOC	Identifying the location of proteins in a cell plays an important role in understanding their functions, such as drug design, therapeutic target discovery and biological research. However, the traditional sub cellular localization experiments are time-consuming, laborious and small scale. With the development of next-generation sequencing technology, the number of proteins has grown exponentially, which lays the foundation of the computational method for identifying protein subcellular localization. Although many methods for predicting subcellular localization of proteins have been proposed, most of them are limited to single-location. In this paper, we propose a multi-kernel SVM to predict subcellular localization of both multi-location and single-location proteins. First, we make use of the evolutionary information extracted from position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and physicochemical properties of proteins, by Chou's general PseAAC and other efficient functions. Then, we propose a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) model to identify multi-label protein subcellular localization. As a result, our method has a good performance on predicting subcellular localization of proteins. It achieves an average precision of 0.7065 and 0.6889 on two human datasets, respectively. All results are higher than those achieved by other existing methods. Therefore, we provide an efficient system via a novel perspective to study the protein subcellular localization.

To tackle this limitation, partial computation offloading can be used as a promising method to schedule some tasks of applications from resource-limited SMDs to high-performance edge servers. However, it brings communication overhead issues caused by limited bandwidth and inevitably increases the latency of tasks offloaded to edge servers. Therefore, it is highly challenging to achieve a balance between high-resource consumption in SMDs and high communication cost for providing energy-efficient and latency-low services to users. This work proposes a partial computation offloading method to minimize the total energy consumed by SMDs and edge servers by jointly optimizing the offloading ratio of tasks, CPU speeds of SMDs, allocated bandwidth of available channels, and transmission power of each SMD in each time slot. It jointly considers the execution time of tasks performed in SMDs and edge servers, and transmission time of data. It also jointly considers latency limits, CPU speeds, transmission power limits, available energy of SMDs, and the maximum number of CPU cycles and memories in edge servers. Considering these factors, a nonlinear constrained optimization problem is formulated and solved by a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named genetic simulated annealing-based particle swarm optimization (GSP) to produce a close-to-optimal solution.

Current computational approaches find many false positives and require ad hoc postprocessing, especially for unusually shaped particles. To address these shortcomings, we develop Topaz, an efficient and accurate particle-picking pipeline using neural networks trained with a general-purpose positive-unlabeled learning method. This framework enables particle detection models to be trained with few sparsely labeled particles and no labeled negatives. Topaz retrieves many more real particles than conventional picking methods while maintaining low false-positive rates, is capable of picking challenging unusually shaped proteins (for example, small, non-globular and asymmetric particles), produces more representative particle sets and does not require post hoc curation. We demonstrate the performance of Topaz on two difficult datasets and three conventional datasets. Topaz is modular, standalone, free and open source (http://topaz.csail.mit.edu).

Among these attacks, false data injection attack represents a main category with its widely varied types and impacts that have been extensively reported recently. In addressing this threat, several detection algorithms have been developed in the last few years. These were either model-based or data-driven algorithms. This paper provides an intensive summary of these algorithms by categorizing them and elaborating on the pros and cons of each category. The paper starts by introducing the various cyber-physical attacks along with the main reported incidents in history. The significance and the impacts of the false data injection attacks are then reported. The concluding remarks present the main criteria that should be considered in developing future detection algorithms for the false data injection attacks.

It is currently poorly known especially at suprasaturation densities partially because of our poor knowledge about isovector nuclear interactions at short distances. Because of its broad impacts on many interesting issues, pinning down the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy has been a longstanding and shared goal of both astrophysics and nuclear physics. New observational data of neutron stars including their masses, radii, and tidal deformations since GW170817 have helped improve our knowledge about nuclear symmetry energy, especially at high densities. Based on various model analyses of these new data by many people in the nuclear astrophysics community, while our brief review might be incomplete and biased unintentionally, we learned in particular the following: (1) The slope parameter L of nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density rho(0) of nuclear matter from 24 new analyses of neutron star observables was about L approximate to 57.7 +/- 19 MeV at a 68% confidence level, consistent with its fiducial value from surveys of over 50 earlier analyses of both terrestrial and astrophysical data within error bars. (2) The curvature Ksym of nuclear symmetry energy at rho(0) from 16 new analyses of neutron star observables was about K-sym approximate to -107 +/- 88 MeV at a 68% confidence level, in very good agreement with the systematics of earlier analyses. (3) The magnitude of nuclear symmetry energy at 2 rho(0), i.e., E-sym(2 rho(0)) approximate to 51 +/- 13 MeV at a 68% confidence level, was extracted from nine new analyses of neutron star observables, consistent with the results from earlier analyses of heavy-ion reactions and the latest predictions of the state-of-the-art nuclear many-body theories. (4) While the available data from canonical neutron stars did not provide tight constraints on nuclear symmetry energy at densities above about 2 rho(0), the lower radius boundary R-2.01 = 12.2 km from NICER's very recent observation of PSR J0740+6620 of mass 2.08 +/- 0.07M(circle dot) and radius R = 12.2-16.3 km at a 68% confidence level set a tight lower limit for nuclear symmetry energy at densities above 2 rho(0). (5) Bayesian inferences of nuclear symmetry energy using models encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark phase transition from observables of canonical neutron stars indicated that the phase transition shifted appreciably both L and K-sym to higher values, but with larger uncertainties compared to analyses assuming no such phase transition. (6) The high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy significantly affected the minimum frequency necessary to rotationally support GW190814's secondary component of mass (2.50-2.67) M-circle dot as the fastest and most massive pulsar discovered so far. Overall, thanks to the hard work of many people in the astrophysics and nuclear physics community, new data of neutron star observations since the discovery of GW170817 have significantly enriched our knowledge about the symmetry energy of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter.

OBJECTIVE To review published reports on the association of school closures during broader social lockdown with mental health, health behaviors, and well-being in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years, excluding associations with transmission of infection. EVIDENCE REVIEW Eleven databases were searched from inception to September 2020, and machine learning was applied for screening articles. A total of 16 817 records were screened, 151 were reviewed in full text, and 36 studies were included. Quality assessment was tailored to study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken because data did not allow meta-analysis. FINDINGS A total of 36 studies from 11 countries were identified, involving a total of 79 781 children and adolescents and 18 028 parents, which occurred during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to July 2020). All evaluated school closure as part of broader social lockdown during the first COVID-19 wave, and the duration of school closure ranged from 1 week to 3 months. Of those, 9 (25%) were longitudinal pre-post studies, 5 (14%) were cohort, 21 (58%) were cross-sectional, and 1 (3%) was a modeling study. Thirteen studies (36%) were high quality, 17 (47%) were medium quality, and 6 (17%) were low quality. Twenty-three studies (64%) were published, 8 (22%) were online reports, and 5 (14%) were preprints. Twenty-five studies (69%) concerning mental health identified associations across emotional, behavioral, and restlessness/inattention problems; 18% to 60% of children and adolescents scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms, and 2 studies reported no significant association with suicide. Three studies reported that child protection referrals were lower than expected number of referrals originating in schools. Three studies suggested higher screen time usage, 2 studies reported greater social media use, and 6 studies reported lower physical activity. Studies on sleep (10 studies) and diet (5 studies) provided inconclusive evidence on harms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this narrative synthesis of reports from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies of short-term school closures as part of social lockdown measures reported adverse mental health symptoms and health behaviors among children and adolescents. Associations between school closure and health outcomes and behaviors could not be separated from broader lockdown measures.

However, the research evidence that should guide this personalization is at present fragmentary, and the selection of treatment is usually based on the clinician's and/or the patient's preference and on safety issues, in a trial-and-error fashion, paying little attention to the particular features of the specific case. This may be one of the reasons why the majority of patients with a diagnosis of depression do not achieve remission with the first treatment they receive. The predominant pessimism about the actual feasibility of the personalization of treatment of depression in routine clinical practice has recently been tempered by some secondary analyses of databases from clinical trials, using approaches such as individual patient data meta-analysis and machine learning, which indicate that some variables may indeed contribute to the identification of patients who are likely to respond differently to various antidepressant drugs or to antidepressant medication vs. specific psychotherapies. The need to develop decision support tools guiding the personalization of treatment of depression has been recently reaffirmed, and the point made that these tools should be developed through large observational studies using a comprehensive battery of self-report and clinical measures. The present paper aims to describe systematically the salient domains that should be considered in this effort to personalize depression treatment. For each domain, the available research evidence is summarized, and the relevant assessment instruments are reviewed, with special attention to their suitability for use in routine clinical practice, also in view of their possible inclusion in the above-mentioned comprehensive battery of measures. The main unmet needs that research should address in this area are emphasized. Where the available evidence allows providing the clinician with specific advice that can already be used today to make the management of depression more personalized, this advice is highlighted. Indeed, some sections of the paper, such as those on neurocognition and on physical comorbidities, indicate that the modern management of depression is becoming increasingly complex, with several components other than simply the choice of an antidepressant and/or a psychotherapy, some of which can already be reliably personalized.

J	Liu, HY; Schneider, P; Haugen, R; Vogt, M				Liu, Hai-Ying; Schneider, Philipp; Haugen, Rolf; Vogt, Matthias			Performance Assessment of a Low-Cost PM2.5 Sensor for a near Four-Month Period in Oslo, Norway	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						air pollution; air quality monitoring; evaluation and calibration; low-cost sensors; Nova PM sensor SDS011; particulate matter; PM2.5	LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; PARTICULATE MATTER; AIR	The very low-cost Nova particulate matter (PM) sensor SDS011 has recently drawn attention for its use for measuring PM mass concentration, which is frequently used as an indicator of air quality. However, this sensor has not been thoroughly evaluated in real-world conditions and its data quality is not well documented. In this study, three SDS011 sensors were evaluated by co-locating them at an official, air quality monitoring station equipped with reference-equivalent instrumentation in Oslo, Norway. The sensors' measurement results for PM2.5 were compared with data generated from the air quality monitoring station over almost a four-month period. Five performance aspects of the sensors were examined: operational data coverage, linearity of response and accuracy, inter-sensor variability, dependence on relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T), and potential improvement of sensor accuracy, by data calibration using a machine-learning method. The results of the study are: (i) the three sensors provide quite similar results, with inter-sensor correlations exhibiting R values higher than 0.97; (ii) all three sensors demonstrate quite high linearity against officially measured concentrations of PM2.5, with R-2 values ranging from 0.55 to 0.71; (iii) high RH (over 80%) negatively affected the sensor response; (iv) data calibration using only the RH and T recorded directly at the three sensors increased the R-2 value from 0.71 to 0.80, 068 to 0.79, and 0.55 to 0.76. The results demonstrate the general feasibility of using these low cost SDS011 sensors for indicative PM2.5 monitoring under certain environmental conditions. Within these constraints, they further indicate that there is potential for deploying large networks of such devices, due to the sensors' relative accuracy, size and cost. This opens up a wide variety of applications, such as high-resolution air quality mapping and personalized air quality information services. However, it should be noted that the sensors exhibit often very high relative errors for hourly values and that there is a high potential of abusing these types of sensors if they are applied outside the manufacturer-provided specifications particularly regarding relative humidity. Furthermore, our analysis covers only a relatively short time period and it is desirable to carry out longer-term studies covering a wider range of meteorological conditions.

OBJECTIVE To review published reports on the association of school closures during broader social lockdown with mental health, health behaviors, and well-being in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years, excluding associations with transmission of infection. EVIDENCE REVIEW Eleven databases were searched from inception to September 2020, and machine learning was applied for screening articles. A total of 16 817 records were screened, 151 were reviewed in full text, and 36 studies were included. Quality assessment was tailored to study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken because data did not allow meta-analysis. FINDINGS A total of 36 studies from 11 countries were identified, involving a total of 79 781 children and adolescents and 18 028 parents, which occurred during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to July 2020). All evaluated school closure as part of broader social lockdown during the first COVID-19 wave, and the duration of school closure ranged from 1 week to 3 months. Of those, 9 (25%) were longitudinal pre-post studies, 5 (14%) were cohort, 21 (58%) were cross-sectional, and 1 (3%) was a modeling study. Thirteen studies (36%) were high quality, 17 (47%) were medium quality, and 6 (17%) were low quality. Twenty-three studies (64%) were published, 8 (22%) were online reports, and 5 (14%) were preprints. Twenty-five studies (69%) concerning mental health identified associations across emotional, behavioral, and restlessness/inattention problems; 18% to 60% of children and adolescents scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms, and 2 studies reported no significant association with suicide. Three studies reported that child protection referrals were lower than expected number of referrals originating in schools. Three studies suggested higher screen time usage, 2 studies reported greater social media use, and 6 studies reported lower physical activity. Studies on sleep (10 studies) and diet (5 studies) provided inconclusive evidence on harms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this narrative synthesis of reports from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies of short-term school closures as part of social lockdown measures reported adverse mental health symptoms and health behaviors among children and adolescents. Associations between school closure and health outcomes and behaviors could not be separated from broader lockdown measures.

Over the following days and weeks, strong reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution were reported in many regions of Spain. A substantial part of these reductions was obviously due to decreased local and regional anthropogenic emissions. Yet, the confounding effect of meteorological variability hinders a reliable quantification of the lockdown's impact upon the observed pollution levels. Our study uses machine-learning (ML) models fed by meteorological data along with other time features to estimate the "business-as-usual" NO2 mixing ratios that would have been observed in the absence of the lockdown. We then quantify the so-called meteorology-normalized NO2 reductions induced by the lockdown measures by comparing the estimated business-as-usual values with the observed NO2 mixing ratios. We applied this analysis for a selection of urban background and traffic stations covering the more than 50 Spanish provinces and islands. The ML predictive models were found to perform remarkably well in most locations, with an overall bias, root mean square error and correlation of +4 %, 29% and 0.86, respectively. During the period of study, from the enforcement of the state of alarm in Spain on 14 March to 23 April, we found the lockdown measures to be responsible for a 50% reduction in NO2 levels on average over all provinces and islands. The lockdown in Spain has gone through several phases with different levels of severity with respect to mobility restrictions. As expected, the meteorology-normalized change in NO2 was found to be stronger during phase II (the most stringent phase) and phase III of the lockdown than during phase I. In the largest agglomerations, where both urban background and traffic stations were available, a stronger meteorology-normalized NO2 change is highlighted at traffic stations compared with urban background sites. Our results are consistent with foreseen (although still uncertain) changes in anthropogenic emissions induced by the lockdown. We also show the importance of taking the meteorological variability into account for accurately assessing the impact of the lockdown on NO2 levels, in particular at fine spatial and temporal scales. Meteorology-normalized estimates such as those presented here are crucial to reliably quantify the health implications of the lockdown due to reduced air pollution.

However, due to technological constraints, it is difficult to provide simultaneously high spatial resolution, high temporal frequency, and high quality observation data. Existing mapping solutions are limited by traditional remotely sensed data, that have shorter observation periods, poor spatio-temporal consistency and comparability. Therefore, a new mapping paradigm is needed. This paper develops a framework for intelligent mapping (iMap) of land cover based on state-of-the-art technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellations, and spatio-temporal reconstruction and fusion. Under this framework, we built an automated, serverless, end-to-end data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and produced the first 30 m global daily seamless data cubes (SDC), and annual to seasonal land cover maps for 1985?2020. The SDC was produced through a multi-source spatio-temporal data reconstruction and fusion workflow based on Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR virtual constellations. Independent validation results show that the relative mean error of the SDC is less than 2.14%. As analysis ready data (ARD), it can lay a foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing information extraction. From this SDC, we produced 36-year long, 30 m resolution global land cover map data set by combining strategies of sample migration, machine learning, and spatio-temporal adjustment. The average overall accuracy of our annual land cover maps over multiple periods of time is 80% for level 1 classification and over 73% for level 2 classification (29 and 33 classes). Based on an objective validation sample consisting of FLUXNET sites, our map accuracy is 10% higher than that of existing global land cover datasets including Globeland30. Our results show that the average global land cover change rate is 0.36%/yr. Global forest decreased by 1.47 million km2 from 38.44 million km2, cropland increased by 0.84 million km2 from 12.49 million km2 and impervious surface increased by 0.48 million km2 from 0.57 million km2 during 1985? 2020.

J	Reichenbach, P; Rossi, M; Malamud, BD; Mihir, M; Guzzetti, F				Reichenbach, Paola; Rossi, Mauro; Malamud, Bruce D.; Mihir, Monika; Guzzetti, Fausto			A review of statistically-based landslide susceptibility models	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS			English	Review						Literature review; Landslide; Susceptibility zonation; Statistical model	RAINFALL-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPATIAL PREDICTION MODELS; EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM; LAND-USE CHANGE; 3 GORGES AREA; SUBMARINE LANDSLIDES; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; SAMPLING STRATEGIES	In this paper, we do a critical review of statistical methods for landslide susceptibility modelling and associated terrain zonations. Landslide susceptibility is the likelihood of a landslide occurring in an area depending on local terrain conditions, estimating "where" landslides are likely to occur. Since the first attempts to assess landslide susceptibility in the mid-1970s, hundreds of papers have been published using a variety of approaches and methods in different geological and climatic settings. Here, we critically review the statistically-based landslide susceptibility assessment literature by systematically searching for and then compiling an extensive database of 565 peer-review articles from 1983 to 2016. For each article in the literature database, we noted 31 categories/sub-categories of information including study region/extent, landslide type/number, inventory type and period covered, statistical model used, including variable types, model fit/prediction performance evaluation method, and strategy used to assess the model uncertainty. We present graphical visualisations and discussions of commonalities and differences found as a function of region and time, revealing a significant heterogeneity of thematic data types and scales, modelling approaches, and model evaluation criteria. We found that the range of thematic data types used for susceptibility assessment has not changed significantly with time, and that for a number of studies the geomorphological significance of the thematic data used is poorly justified. We also found that the most common statistical methods for landslide susceptibility modelling include logistic regression, neural network analysis, data-overlay, index-based and weight of evidence analyses, with an increasing preference towards machine learning methods in the recent years. Although an increasing number of studies in recent years have assessed the model performance, in terms of model fit and prediction performance, only a handful of studies have evaluated the model uncertainty. Adopting a Susceptibility Quality Level index, we found that the quality of published models has improved over the years, but top-quality assessments remain rare. We identified a clear geographical bias in susceptibility study locations, with many studies in China, India, Italy and Turkey, and only a few in Africa, South America and Oceania. Based on previous literature reviews, the analysis of the information collected in the literature database, and our own experience on the subject, we provide recommendations for the preparation, evaluation, and use of landslide susceptibility models and associated terrain zonations.

This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an all-in-one' solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided.

Accurate identification of its sites will be very helpful for revealing the biological functions of 6mA, but it is time-consuming and expensive to determine them by experiments alone. Unfortunately, so far, no bioinformatics tool is available to do so. To fill in such an empty area, we have proposed a novel predictor called iDNA6mA-PseKNC that is established by incorporating nucleotide physicochemical properties into Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition (PseKNC). It has been observed via rigorous cross-validations that the predictor's sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc), and stability (MCC) are 93%, 100%, 96%, and 0.93, respectively. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web server for iDNA6mA-PseKNC has been established at http://lin-group.cn/server/iDNA6mA-PseKNC, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.

Their commercial development is still hindered by noble platinum (Pt) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, which not only determine the energy conversion efficiency and service life but also are closely related to the cost and broad application of fuel cells. Given the bright and enormous future of fuel cells, ORR catalysts should possess highly efficient performance yet meet the acceptable Pt costs for large-scale application. Extensive efforts are concentrated on the optimization of Pt-based nanostructures and upgradation of functional carriers to achieve the low-cost and high-activity Pt-based catalysts. By improving the Pt utilization and accessible surface, reducing Pt consumption and catalyst costs, accelerating mass exchange and electron transfer, alleviating the corrosion and agglomeration of carriers and Pt, accompanying with the assistance of robust yet effective functional supports, the service level and life of Pt-based electrocatalysts would be significantly improved and fuel cells could get into commercial market covering broader applications. In this Account, we focus on the recent development of Pt-based catalysts to figure out the problems associated with ORR catalysts in fuel cells. Recent development of Pt-based catalysts is discussed in different stages: (1) multiscale development of Pt-based nanostructures; (2) multielement regulation over Pt-based alloy composition; (3) upgradation of carbon and noncarbon support architectures; (4) development of integrated Pt-based catalysts for fuel cells. Finally, we propose some future issues (such as reaction mechanism, dynamic evolutions, and structure-activity relationship) for Pt-based catalysts, which mainly involve the preparation strategy of Pt-integrated catalysts (combination of Pt nanostructures with nanocarbons), performance evaluation (standard measurement protocols, laboratory-level rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, application-level membrane electrode assembly (MEA) service test), advanced interpretation techniques (spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and in situ monitoring), and cutting-edge simulation/calculations and artificial intelligence (simulation, calculations, machine learning, big data screening). This Account calls for the comprehensive development of multiscale, multicomponent, and high-entropy Pt-based alloy nanostructures, and novel and stable carriers, which provide more available options for rational design of low-cost and high-performance Pt-integrated ORR catalysts. More importantly, it will give an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism, dynamic development, and structure-performance relationship for Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells and related energy technologies.

The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015-2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.

J	Zhu, LC; Yang, Y				Zhu, Linchao; Yang, Yi			Label Independent Memory for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Video Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Few-shot video classification; semi-supervised learning; memory-augmented neural networks; compound memory networks		In this paper, we propose to leverage freely available unlabeled video data to facilitate few-shot video classification. In this semi-supervised few-shot video classification task, millions of unlabeled data are available for each episode during training. These videos can be extremely imbalanced, while they have profound visual and motion dynamics. To tackle the semi-supervised few-shot video classification problem, we make the following contributions. First, we propose a label independent memory (LIM) to cache label related features, which enables a similarity search over a large set of videos. LIM produces a class prototype for few-shot training. This prototype is an aggregated embedding for each class, which is more robust to noisy video features. Second, we integrate a multi-modality compound memory network to capture both RGB and flow information. We propose to store the RGB and flow representation in two separate memory networks, but they are jointly optimized via a unified loss. In this way, mutual communications between the two modalities are leveraged to achieve better classification performance. Third, we conduct extensive experiments on the few-shot Kinetics-100, Something-Something-100 datasets, which validates the effectiveness of leveraging the accessible unlabeled data for few-shot classification.

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: Performance, Mechanism, and Implementation on Near-Term Devices	PHYSICAL REVIEW X			English	Article							COHERENT ISING MACHINE; MAX-CUT; MATRIX; DYNAMICS; LATTICE; SET	The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. Despite its promise for near-term quantum applications, not much is currently understood about the QAOA's performance beyond its lowestdepth variant. An essential but missing ingredient for understanding and deploying the QAOA is a constructive approach to carry out the outer-loop classical optimization. We provide an in-depth study of the performance of the QAOA on MaxCut problems by developing an efficient parameter-optimization procedure and revealing its ability to exploit nonadiabatic operations. Building on observed patterns in optimal parameters, we propose heuristic strategies for initializing optimizations to find quasioptimal p-level QAOA parameters in O[poly(p)] time, whereas the standard strategy of random initialization requires 2(O)(P) optimization runs to achieve similar performance. We then benchmark the QAOA and compare it with quantum annealing, especially on difficult instances where adiabatic quantum annealing fails due to small spectral gaps. The comparison reveals that the QAOA can learn via optimization to utilize nonadiabatic mechanisms to circumvent the challenges associated with vanishing spectral gaps. Finally, we provide a realistic resource analysis on the experimental implementation of the QAOA. When quantum fluctuations in measurements are accounted for, we illustrate that optimization is important only for problem sizes beyond numerical simulations but accessible on near-term devices. We propose a feasible implementation of large MaxCut problems with a few hundred vertices in a system of 2D neutral atoms, reaching the regime to challenge the best classical algorithms.

J	Sun, W; Huang, CC				Sun, Wei; Huang, Chenchen			A carbon price prediction model based on secondary decomposition algorithm and optimized back propagation neural network	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Carbon price prediction; Secondary decomposition; Back propagation neural network; Empirical mode decomposition; Genetic algorithm	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; FORECASTING METHOD; WAVELET	Carbon trading is one of the important mechanisms used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The increasing interest in the carbon trading market has heightened the need to decrease the prediction error of the carbon price. In this paper, a new hybrid model for carbon price forecasting is proposed, and the secondary decomposition algorithm is innovatively introduced into carbon price forecasting. First, time series data were decomposed into several intrinsic modal functions by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Second, the first intrinsic mode function (IMF1) was further decomposed by variational mode decomposition (VMD). Then, the model input was determined by partial autocorrelation analysis (PACF). Finally, the back propagation (BP) neural network model optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) was utilized for prediction. In the empirical analysis of the Hubei market, the proposed model outperforms other comparative models. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), goodness of fit (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the model are 1.7577%, 0.9929 and 0.5441, respectively. In the complementary cases of the Beijing and Shanghai carbon markets, the model also performs best. The results suggest that the proposed model is effective and robust and could predict carbon prices more accurately. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These problems are ill-posed, and the common assumptions for existing methods are usually based on heuristic image priors. In this paper, we show that these problems can be solved by generative models with adversarial learning. However, a straightforward formulation based on a straightforward generative adversarial network (GAN) does not perform well in these tasks, and some structures of the estimated images are usually not preserved well. Motivated by an interesting observation that the estimated results should be consistent with the observed inputs under the physics models, we propose an algorithm that guides the estimation process of a specific task within the GAN framework. The proposed model is trained in an end-to-end fashion and can be applied to a variety of image restoration and low-level vision problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.

J	Parsa, M				Parsa, Mohammad			A data augmentation approach to XGboost-based mineral potential mapping: An example of carbonate-hosted Zn-Pb mineral systems of Western Iran	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION			English	Article						Data augmentation; XGboost; Mineral potential; Carbonate-hosted mineralization	LEAD-ZINC DEPOSITS; GEOCHEMICAL DATA; RANDOM FORESTS; PROSPECTIVITY; AREA; DISTRICT; MODELS; BELT; MACHINE; CONVERGENCE	This study intends to showcase the application of Extreme Gradient boosting (XGboost), a state-of-the-art ensemble-learning technique, for district-scale mineral potential mapping (MPM) of carbonate-hosted Zn-Pb mineral systems in the Emarat district, W Iran. Notwithstanding the demonstrated effectiveness of XGboost in addressing a range of classification and regression problems, the inadequate number of deposit locations employed as labeled samples, which is intrinsic to district-scale MPM, impedes the practical application of this method. Given this notion, an iterative window-based data augmentation technique was proposed and applied to generate additional labeled samples. The predictive models derived by XGboost were compared to those generated by random forests (RF). Both methods were applied to a set of mineral systems-derived exploration targeting criteria representing critical ore-forming processes. Setting aside the similarities of predictive models derived by both methods, it was recognized that RF is much less sensitive to insufficient labeled samples. It was also recognized that, unlike RF, many parameters require tuning for generating an optimum XGboost-based predictive model. Nevertheless, given the achieved results, XGboost slightly outperformed RF in generating an optimum predictive model. Therefore, XGboost coupled to data augmentation can be deemed a viable alternative for district-scale, data-driven MPM.

Typical counting models predict crowd density for an image as opposed to detecting every person. These regression methods, in general, fail to localize persons accurate enough for most applications other than counting. Hence, we adopt an architecture that locates every person in the crowd, sizes the spotted heads with bounding box and then counts them. Compared to normal object or face detectors, there exist certain unique challenges in designing such a detection system. Some of them are direct consequences of the huge diversity in dense crowds along with the need to predict boxes contiguously. We solve these issues and develop our LSC-CNN model, which can reliably detect heads of people across sparse to dense crowds. LSC-CNN employs a multi-column architecture with top-down feature modulation to better resolve persons and produce refined predictions at multiple resolutions. Interestingly, the proposed training regime requires only point head annotation, but can estimate approximate size information of heads. We show that LSC-CNN not only has superior localization than existing density regressors, but outperforms in counting as well. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/val-iisc/lsc-cnn.	[Sam, Deepak Babu; Peri, Skand Vishwanath; Sundararaman, Mukuntha Narayanan; Kamath, Amogh; Babu, R.

Recent advances in backbone convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continually demonstrate stronger multi-scale representation ability, leading to consistent performance gains on a wide range of applications. However, most existing methods represent the multi-scale features in a layer-wise manner. In this paper, we propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone CNN models, e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt, and DLA. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models on widely-used datasets, e.g., CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Further ablation studies and experimental results on representative computer vision tasks, i.e., object detection, class activation mapping, and salient object detection, further verify the superiority of the Res2Net over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

J	Mustaqeem; Kwon, S				Mustaqeem; Kwon, Soonil			Att-Net: Enhanced emotion recognition system using lightweight self-attention module	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Affective computing; Attention mechanism; Emotion recognition; Lightweight CNN; Spectrograms; Self-attention module	NEURAL-NETWORK; SPECTRAL FEATURES; SPEECH; RECURRENT; CNN; PREDICTION; MACHINE; MODEL; IMAGE	Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an active research field of digital signal processing and plays a crucial role in numerous applications of Human-computer interaction (HCI). Nowadays, the baseline state of the art systems has quite a low accuracy and high computations, which needs upgrading to make it reasonable for real-time industrial uses such as detection of content from speech data. The main intent for low recognition rate and high computational cost is a scarceness of datasets, model configuration, and patterns recognition that is the supreme stimulating work for building a robust SER system. In this study, we address these problems and propose a simple and lightweight deep learning-based self-attention module (SAM) for SER system. The transitional features map is given to SAM, which produces efficiently the channel and spatial axes attention map with insignificant overheads. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in channel attention to extracting global cues and a special dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) in spatial attention to extract spatial info from input tensor. Moreover, we merge, spatial and channel attention maps to produce a combine attention weights as a self-attention module. We placed SAM in the middle of convolutional and connected layers and trained it in an end-to-end mode. The ablation study and comprehensive experimentations are accompanied over IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, and EMO-DB speech emotion datasets. The proposed SER system shows consistent improvements in overall experiments for all datasets and shows 78.01%, 80.00%, and 93.00% average recall, respectively. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						Low cost sensor/monitor; Air pollution sensing; Sensor data utilisation; Air sensor/monitor performance; Personal exposure monitoring	REAL-TIME SENSORS; FIELD CALIBRATION; AVAILABLE SENSORS; POLLUTION; NETWORK; PM2.5; OZONE; INDOOR; CLUSTER; PROJECT	Over the past decade, a range of sensor technologies became available on the market, enabling a revolutionary shift in air pollution monitoring and assessment. With their cost of up to three orders of magnitude lower than standard/reference instruments, many avenues for applications have opened up. In particular, broader participation in air quality discussion and utilisation of information on air pollution by communities has become possible. However, many questions have been also asked about the actual benefits of these technologies. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive literature search including both the scientific and grey literature. We focused upon two questions: (1) Are these technologies fit for the various purposes envisaged? and (2) How far have these technologies and their applications progressed to provide answers and solutions? Regarding the former, we concluded that there is no clear answer to the question, due to a lack of: sensor/monitor manufacturers' quantitative specifications of performance, consensus regarding recommended end-use and associated minimal performance targets of these technologies, and the ability of the prospective users to formulate the requirements for their applications, or conditions of the intended use. Numerous studies have assessed and reported sensor/monitor performance under a range of specific conditions, and in many cases the performance was concluded to be satisfactory. The specific use cases for sensors/monitors included outdoor in a stationary mode, outdoor in a mobile mode, indoor environments and personal monitoring. Under certain conditions of application, project goals, and monitoring environments, some sensors/monitors were fit for a specific purpose. Based on analysis of 17 large projects, which reached applied outcome stage, and typically conducted by consortia of organizations, we observed that a sizable fraction of them (similar to 30%) were commercial and/or crowd-funded. This fact by itself signals a paradigm change in air quality monitoring, which previously had been primarily implemented by government organizations. An additional paradigm-shift indicator is the growing use of machine learning or other advanced data processing approaches to improve sensor/monitor agreement with reference monitors. There is still some way to go in enhancing application of the technologies for source apportionment, which is of particular necessity and urgency in developing countries. Also, there has been somewhat less progress in wide-scale monitoring of personal exposures. However, it can be argued that with a significant future expansion of monitoring networks, including indoor environments, there may be less need for wearable or portable sensors/monitors to assess personal exposure. Traditional personal monitoring would still be valuable where spatial variability of pollutants of interest is at a finer resolution than the monitoring network can resolve.

A way forward is to optimally combine the global network of earth system observations with advanced numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to generate consistent spatio-temporal maps of land, ocean, and atmospheric variables of interest, which is known as a reanalysis. While the current generation of NWP models output runoff at each grid cell, they currently do not produce river discharge at catchment scales directly and thus have limited utility in hydrological applications such as flood and drought monitoring and forecasting. This is overcome in the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS; http://www.globalfloods.eu/, last access: 28 June 2020) by coupling surface and sub-surface runoff from the Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (HTESSEL) land surface model used within ECMWF's latest global atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) with the LISFLOOD hydrological and channel routing model. The aim of this paper is to describe and evaluate the GloFAS-ERA5 global river discharge reanalysis dataset launched on 5 November 2019 (version 2.1 release). The river discharge reanalysis is a global gridded dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0.1 degrees at a daily time step. An innovative feature is that it is produced in an operational environment so is available to users from 1 January 1979 until near real time (2 to 5 d behind real time). The reanalysis was evaluated against a global network of 1801 daily river discharge observation stations. Results found that the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis was skilful against a mean flow benchmark in 86% of catchments according to the modified Kling-Gupta efficiency skill score, although the strength of skill varied considerably with location. The global median Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.61 with an interquartile range of 0.44 to 0.74. The long-term and operational nature of the GloFAS-ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides a valuable dataset to the user community for applications ranging from monitoring global flood and drought conditions to the identification of hydroclimatic variability and change and as raw input for post-processing and machine learning methods that can add further value. The dataset is openly available from the Copernicus Climate Change Service Climate Data Store: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-glofas-historical?tab=overview (last access: 28 June 2020) with the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.a4fdd6b9 (C3S, 2019).

Due to the challenges associated with acquiring dense ground-truth depth across different environments at scale, a number of datasets with distinct characteristics and biases have emerged. We develop tools that enable mixing multiple datasets during training, even if their annotations are incompatible. In particular, we propose a robust training objective that is invariant to changes in depth range and scale, advocate the use of principled multi-objective learning to combine data from different sources, and highlight the importance of pretraining encoders on auxiliary tasks. Armed with these tools, we experiment with five diverse training datasets, including a new, massive data source: 3D films. To demonstrate the generalization power of our approach we use zero-shot cross-dataset transfer, i.e. we evaluate on datasets that were not seen during training. The experiments confirm that mixing data from complementary sources greatly improves monocular depth estimation. Our approach clearly outperforms competing methods across diverse datasets, setting a new state of the art for monocular depth estimation.

However, most of the current popular network architectures tend to ignore the misalignment issues during the feature aggregation process caused by step-by-step downsampling operations and indiscriminate contextual information fusion. In this paper, we explore the principles in addressing such feature misalignment issues and inventively propose Feature-Aligned Segmentation Networks (AlignSeg). AlignSeg consists of two primary modules, i.e., the Aligned Feature Aggregation (AlignFA) module and the Aligned Context Modeling (AlignCM) module. First, AlignFA adopts a simple learnable interpolation strategy to learn transformation offsets of pixels, which can effectively relieve the feature misalignment issue caused by multi-resolution feature aggregation. Second, with the contextual embeddings in hand, AlignCM enables each pixel to choose private custom contextual information adaptively, making the contextual embeddings be better aligned. We validate the effectiveness of our AlignSeg network with extensive experiments on Cityscapes and ADE20K, achieving new state-of-the-art mIoU scores of 82.6 and 45.95 percent, respectively.

We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics over 10 months in 963 individuals who predominantly experienced mild COVID-19. Investigating 2,146 samples, we initially detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 94.4% of individuals, with 82% and 79% exhibiting serum and IgG neutralization, respectively. Approximately 3% of individuals demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, with these "elite neutralizers" also possessing SARS-CoV-1 cross-neutralizing IgG. Multivariate statistical modeling revealed age, symptomatic infection, disease severity, and gender as key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity. A loss of reactivity to the virus spike protein was observed in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Neutralizing activity had half-lives of 14.7 weeks in serum versus 31.4 weeks in purified IgG, indicating a rather long-term IgG antibody response. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum in the initial SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody response, with sustained antibodies in most individuals for 10 months after mild COVID-19.

J	Radenovic, F; Tolias, G; Chum, O				Radenovic, Filip; Tolias, Giorgos; Chum, Ondrej			Fine-Tuning CNN Image Retrieval with No Human Annotation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Image representation; processing and computer vision; computing methodologies; neural nets; pattern recognition; applications	QUERY EXPANSION; DESCRIPTORS; SIMILARITY	Image descriptors based on activations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become dominant in image retrieval due to their discriminative power, compactness of representation, and search efficiency. Training of CNNs, either from scratch or fine-tuning, requires a large amount of annotated data, where a high quality of annotation is often crucial. In this work, we propose to fine-tune CNNs for image retrieval on a large collection of unordered images in a fully automated manner. Reconstructed 3D models obtained by the state-of-the-art retrieval and structure-from-motion methods guide the selection of the training data. We show that both hard-positive and hard-negative examples, selected by exploiting the geometry and the camera positions available from the 3D models, enhance the performance of particular-object retrieval. CNN descriptor whitening discriminatively learned from the same training data outperforms commonly used PCA whitening. We propose a novel trainable Generalized-Mean (GeM) pooling layer that generalizes max and average pooling and show that it boosts retrieval performance. Applying the proposed method to the VGG network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmarks: Oxford Buildings, Paris, and Holidays datasets.

Recent works attempted to utilize recurrent neural networks to model the temporal dependencies between the 3D positional configurations of human body joints for better analysis of human activities in the skeletal data. The proposed work extends this idea to spatial domain as well as temporal domain to better analyze the hidden sources of action-related information within the human skeleton sequences in both of these domains simultaneously. Based on the pictorial structure of Kinect's skeletal data, an effective tree-structure based traversal framework is also proposed. In order to deal with the noise in the skeletal data, a new gating mechanism within LSTM module is introduced, with which the network can learn the reliability of the sequential data and accordingly adjust the effect of the input data on the updating procedure of the long-term context representation stored in the unit's memory cell. Moreover, we introduce a novel multi-modal feature fusion strategy within the LSTM unit in this paper. The comprehensive experimental results on seven challenging benchmark datasets for human action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The impact of neutralising antibody waning rate at the individual patient level on the longevity of immunity remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the peak levels and dynamics of neutralising antibody waning and IgG avidity maturation over time, and correlate this with clinical parameters, cytokines, and T-cell responses. Methods We did a longitudinal study of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 up to day 180 post-symptom onset by monitoring changes in neutralising antibody levels using a previously validated surrogate virus neutralisation test. Changes in antibody avidities and other immune markers at different convalescent stages were determined and correlated with clinical features. Using a machine learning algorithm, temporal change in neutralising antibody levels was classified into five groups and used to predict the longevity of neutralising antibody-mediated immunity. Findings We approached 517 patients for participation in the study, of whom 288 consented for outpatient follow-up and collection of serial blood samples. 164 patients were followed up and had adequate blood samples collected for analysis, with a total of 546 serum samples collected, including 128 blood samples taken up to 180 days post-symptom onset. We identified five distinctive patterns of neutralising antibody dynamics as follows: negative, individuals who did not, at our intervals of sampling, develop neutralising antibodies at the 30% inhibition level (19 [12%] of 164 patients); rapid waning, individuals who had varying levels of neutralising antibodies from around 20 days after symptom onset, but seroreverted in less than 180 days (44 [27%] of 164 patients); slow waning, individuals who remained neutralising antibody-positive at 180 days post-symptom onset (46 [28%] of 164 patients); persistent, although with varying peak neutralising antibody levels, these individuals had minimal neutralising antibody decay (52 [32%] of 164 patients); and delayed response, a small group that showed an unexpected increase of neutralising antibodies during late convalescence (at 90 or 180 days after symptom onset; three [2%] of 164 patients). Persistence of neutralising antibodies was associated with disease severity and sustained level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, T-cell responses were similar among the different neutralising antibody dynamics groups. On the basis of the different decay dynamics, we established a prediction algorithm that revealed a wide range of neutralising antibody longevity, varying from around 40 days to many decades. Interpretation Neutralising antibody response dynamics in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 vary greatly, and prediction of immune longevity can only be accurately determined at the individual level. Our findings emphasise the importance of public health and social measures in the ongoing pandemic outbreak response, and might have implications for longevity of immunity after vaccination.

Moreover, we design a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of semantics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum framework to gradually adapt semantic segmentation models from day to night through progressively darker times of day, exploiting cross-time-of-day correspondences between daytime images from a reference map and dark images to guide the label inference in the dark domains; 2) a novel uncertainty-aware annotation and evaluation framework and metric for semantic segmentation, including image regions beyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion; 3) the Dark Zurich dataset, comprising 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920 unlabeled twilight images with correspondences to their daytime counterparts plus a set of 201 nighttime images with fine pixel-level annotations created with our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark for our novel evaluation. Experiments show that our map-guided curriculum adaptation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nighttime sets both for standard metrics and our uncertainty-aware metric. Furthermore, our uncertainty-aware evaluation reveals that selective invalidation of predictions can improve results on data with ambiguous content such as our benchmark and profit safety-oriented applications involving invalid inputs.

An artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of patients with atrial fibrillation during sinus rhythm: a retrospective analysis of outcome prediction	LANCET			English	Article							INTERATRIAL BLOCK; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; DYSFUNCTION; PREVALENCE; GUIDELINE; APPENDAGE; WARFARIN; ASPIRIN; RISK	Background Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning. Methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7: 1: 2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95% CIs. Findings We included 180 922 patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454 789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset, 64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130 802 ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8.4%) patients in the testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.88), sensitivity of 79.0% (77.5-80.4), specificity of 79.5% (79.0-79.9), F1 score of 39.2% (38.1-40.3), and overall accuracy of 79.4% (79.0-79.9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0.90 (0.90-0.91), sensitivity to 82.3% (80.9-83.6), specificity to 83.4% (83.0-83.8), F1 score to 45.4% (44.2-46.5), and overall accuracy to 83.3% (83.0-83.7). Interpretation An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation. Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Peng, Q; Ma, HL; Shuai, ZG				Peng, Qian; Ma, Huili; Shuai, Zhigang			Theory of Long-Lived Room-Temperature Phosphorescence in Organic Aggregates	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Review							ACHIEVING PERSISTENT; INDUCED EMISSION; PI INTERACTIONS; STATE; FLUORESCENCE; PREDICTION; MOLECULES; AFTERGLOW; DYNAMICS; STRATEGY	Room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with a long afterglow from purely organic molecular aggregates has recently attracted many investigations because traditionally only inorganic and transition-metal complexes can emit phosphorescence at room temperature. Purely organic molecules can exhibit phosphorescence only at cryogenic temperatures and under inert conditions in solution. However, recently, a number of organic compounds have been found to demonstrate bright RTP upon aggregation, sometimes with a remarkable morphology dependence. We intended to rationalize such aggregation-induced organic RTP through theoretical investigation and quantum chemistry calculations by invoking intermolecular interaction effects. And we have identified the molecular descriptors for the molecular design of RTP materials. In this Account, we started with the proposition of the mechanism of intermolecular electrostatic-interaction-induced RTP at the molecular level by using molecular dynamics simulations, hybrid quantum mechanics, and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) coupled with the thermal vibration correlation function (TVCF) formalism we developed earlier. The effective intermolecular electrostatic interactions could stem from a variety of interactions in different organic RTP crystals, such as hydrogen bonding, pi-halogen bonding, anion-pi(+) interaction, and d-p pi bonds and so forth. We find that these interactions can change the molecular orbital compositions involved in the lowest-lying singlet and triplet excited states that are responsible for phosphorescence, either through facilitating intersystem crossing from the excited-state singlet to the triplet and/or suppressing the nonradiative decay process from the lowest triplet to the ground state. This underlying RTP mechanism is believed to be very helpful in systematically and comprehensively understanding the aggregation/crystal-induced persistent organic RTP, which has been applied to explain a number of experiments. We then propose the molecular descriptors to characterize the phosphorescence efficiency and lifetime, respectively, derived from fundamental photophysical processes and requirements to obey the El-Sayed rule and generate phosphorescence. For a prototypical RTP system consisting of a carbonyl group and pi-conjugated segments, the excited states can be regarded as an admixture of n -> pi* (with portion alpha) and pi -> pi (with portion /3). The intersystem crossing (ISC) rate of S-1 -> T-n is mostly governed by the modification of the product of a and beta, and the nonradiative rate of T-1 -> S-0 is determined by the beta value of T-1. Thus, we employ gamma = alpha x beta and beta to describe the phosphorescence efficiency and lifetime, respectively, which have been successfully applied in the molecular design of efficient and long-lived RTP systems in experiments. The molecular descriptors outlined in this Account, which are easily obtained from simple quantum chemistry calculations, are expected to play important roles in the machine-learning-based molecular screening in the future.

Our estimates are provided in the form of a dataset of reduction factors varying per country and day that will allow the modelling and identification of the associated impacts upon air quality. The country- and daily-resolved reduction factors are provided for each of the following source categories: energy industry (power plants), manufacturing industry, road traffic and aviation (landing and take-off cycle). We computed the reduction factors based on open-access and near-real-time measured activity data from a wide range of information sources. We also trained a machine learning model with meteorological data to derive weather-normalized electricity consumption reductions. The time period covered is from 21 February, when the first European localized lockdown was implemented in the region of Lombardy (Italy), until 26 April 2020. This period includes 5 weeks (23 March until 26 April) with the most severe and relatively unchanged restrictions upon mobility and socio-economic activities across Europe. The computed reduction factors were combined with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service's European emission inventory using adjusted temporal emission profiles in order to derive time-resolved emission reductions per country and pollutant sector. During the most severe lockdown period, we estimate the average emission reductions to be -33 % for NOx, -8 % for non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), -7 % for SOx and -7 % for PM2.5 at the EU-30 level (EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland). For all pollutants more than 85 % of the total reduction is attributable to road transport, except SOx. The reductions reached -50 % (NOx), -14 % (NMVOCs), -12 % (SOx ) and -15 % (PM2.5) in countries where the lockdown restrictions were more severe such as Italy, France or Spain. To show the potential for air quality modelling, we simulated and evaluated NO2 concentration decreases in rural and urban background regions across Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, United-Kingdom and Sweden). We found the lockdown measures to be responsible for NO2 reductions of up to - 58 % at urban background locations (Madrid, Spain) and - 44 % at rural background areas (France), with an average contribution of the traffic sector to total reductions of 86 % and 93 %, respectively. A clear improvement of the modelled results was found when considering the emission reduction factors, especially in Madrid, Paris and London where the bias is reduced by more than 90 %.

Practical visual localization approaches need to be robust to a wide variety of viewing conditions, including day-night changes, as well as weather and seasonal variations, while providing highly accurate six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) camera pose estimates. In this paper, we extend three publicly available datasets containing images captured under a wide variety of viewing conditions, but lacking camera pose information, with ground truth pose information, making evaluation of the impact of various factors on 6DOF camera pose estimation accuracy possible. We also discuss the performance of state-of-the-art localization approaches on these datasets. Additionally, we release around half of the poses for all conditions, and keep the remaining half private as a test set, in the hopes that this will stimulate research on long-term visual localization, learned local image features, and related research areas. Our datasets are available at visuallocalization.net, where we are also hosting a benchmarking server for automatic evaluation of results on the test set. The presented state-of-the-art results are to a large degree based on submissions to our server.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art automatic segmentation methods. However, fully automatic results may still need to be refined to become accurate and robust enough for clinical use. We propose a deep learning-based interactive segmentation method to improve the results obtained by an automatic CNN and to reduce user interactions during refinement for higher accuracy. We use one CNN to obtain an initial automatic segmentation, on which user interactions are added to indicate mis-segmentations. Another CNN takes as input the user interactions with the initial segmentation and gives a refined result. We propose to combine user interactions with CNNs through geodesic distance transforms, and propose a resolution-preserving network that gives a better dense prediction. In addition, we integrate user interactions as hard constraints into a back-propagatable Conditional Random Field. We validated the proposed framework in the context of 2D placenta segmentation from fetal MRI and 3D brain tumor segmentation from FLAIR images. Experimental results show our method achieves a large improvement from automatic CNNs, and obtains comparable and even higher accuracy with fewer user interventions and less time compared with traditional interactive methods.

Recently, a number of data-driven frame interpolation methods based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed. However, existing learning based methods typically estimate either flow or compensation kernels, thereby limiting performance on both computational efficiency and interpolation accuracy. In this work, we propose a motion estimation and compensation driven neural network for video frame interpolation. A novel adaptive warping layer is developed to integrate both optical flow and interpolation kernels to synthesize target frame pixels. This layer is fully differentiable such that both the flow and kernel estimation networks can be optimized jointly. The proposed model benefits from the advantages of motion estimation and compensation methods without using hand-crafted features. Compared to existing methods, our approach is computationally efficient and able to generate more visually appealing results. Furthermore, the proposed MEMC-Net architecture can be seamlessly adapted to several video enhancement tasks, e.g., super-resolution, denoising, and deblocking. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art video frame interpolation and enhancement algorithms on a wide range of datasets.

We propose to exploit the face geometry by modeling the facial landmarks motion as curves encoded as points on a hypersphere. By proposing a conditional version of manifold-valued Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN) for motion generation on the hypersphere, we learn the distribution of facial expression dynamics of different classes, from which we synthesize new facial expression motions. The resulting motions can be transformed to sequences of landmarks and then to images sequences by editing the texture information using another conditional Generative Adversarial Network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores manifold-valued representations with GAN to address the problem of dynamic facial expression generation. We evaluate our proposed approach both quantitatively and qualitatively on two public datasets; Oulu-CASIA and MUG Facial Expression. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic videos with continuous motion, realistic appearance and identity preservation. We also show the efficiency of our framework for dynamic facial expressions generation, dynamic facial expression transfer and data augmentation for training improved emotion recognition models.

In this paper, we extend our preliminary work PointRCNN to a novel and strong point-cloud-based 3D object detection framework, the part-aware and aggregation neural network (Part-A(2) net). The whole framework consists of the part-aware stage and the part-aggregation stage. First, the part-aware stage for the first time fully utilizes free-of-charge part supervisions derived from 3D ground-truth boxes to simultaneously predict high quality 3D proposals and accurate intra-object part locations. The predicted intra-object part locations within the same proposal are grouped by our new-designed RoI-aware point cloud pooling module, which results in an effective representation to encode the geometry-specific features of each 3D proposal. Then the part-aggregation stage learns to re-score the box and refine the box location by exploring the spatial relationship of the pooled intra-object part locations. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance improvements from each component of our proposed framework. Our Part-A(2) net outperforms all existing 3D detection methods and achieves new state-of-the-art on KITTI 3D object detection dataset by utilizing only the LiDAR point cloud data.

Yet, the widely adopted horizontal bounding box representation is not appropriate for ubiquitous oriented objects such as objects in aerial images and scene texts. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework to detect multi-oriented objects. Instead of directly regressing the four vertices, we glide the vertex of the horizontal bounding box on each corresponding side to accurately describe a multi-oriented object. Specifically, We regress four length ratios characterizing the relative gliding offset on each corresponding side. This may facilitate the offset learning and avoid the confusion issue of sequential label points for oriented objects. To further remedy the confusion issue for nearly horizontal objects, we also introduce an obliquity factor based on area ratio between the object and its horizontal bounding box, guiding the selection of horizontal or oriented detection for each object. We add these five extra target variables to the regression head of faster R-CNN, which requires ignorable extra computation time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that without bells and whistles, the proposed method achieves superior performances on multiple multi-oriented object detection benchmarks including object detection in aerial images, scene text detection, pedestrian detection in fisheye images.

Unfortunately, while its restoration performance benefits from more spectral bands, its runtime also substantially increases. In this paper, we claim that the HSI lies in a global spectral low-rank subspace, and the spectral subspaces of each full band patch group should lie in this global low-rank subspace. This motivates us to propose a unified paradigm combining the spatial and spectral properties for HSI restoration. The proposed paradigm enjoys performance superiority from the non-local spatial denoising and light computation complexity from the low-rank orthogonal basis exploration. An efficient alternating minimization algorithm with rank adaptation is developed. It is done by first solving a fidelity term-related problem for the update of a latent input image, and then learning a low-dimensional orthogonal basis and the related reduced image from the latent input image. Subsequently, non-local low-rank denoising is developed to refine the reduced image and orthogonal basis iteratively. Finally, the experiments on HSI denoising, compressed reconstruction, and inpainting tasks, with both simulated and real datasets, demonstrate its superiority with respect to state-of-the-art HSI restoration methods.

However, the identification of key variables is a crucial step in ensuring robustness and accuracy in AI modeling, but thus far, little attention has been given to this topic. In the present study, mutual information (MI)-based measures are proposed for input variable selection (IVS) and incorporated into optimized support vector regression (SVR) for the displacement prediction of seepage-driven landslides. The performance of optimized SVR models with ten MI-based IVS strategies is compared. A typical seepage-driven landslide was chosen for comparison. The experimental results indicate that IVS-based optimized SVR can significantly improve predictions. When the variable-reduced inputs were input into the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC)-SVR model, the mean values of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) decreased and increased by as much as 71.6 and 95.2%, respectively, relative to those for the base model with all candidates. Furthermore, the joint mutual information (JMI) and double input symmetrical relevance (DISR) criteria are recommended for IVS for seepage-driven landslides because they achieve the best tradeoff between accuracy and stability.

A high-quality drug candidate should not only have sufficient efficacy against the therapeutic target, but also show appropriate ADMET properties at a therapeutic dose. A lot of in silico models are hence developed for prediction of chemical ADMET properties. However, it is still not easy to evaluate the drug-likeness of compounds in terms of so many ADMET properties. In this study, we proposed a scoring function named the ADMET-score to evaluate drug-likeness of a compound. The scoring function was defined on the basis of 18 ADMET properties predicted via our web server admetSAR. The weight of each property in the ADMET-score was determined by three parameters: the accuracy rate of the model, the importance of the endpoint in the process of pharmacokinetics, and the usefulness index. The FDA-approved drugs from DrugBank, the small molecules from ChEMBL and the old drugs withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns were used to evaluate the performance of the ADMET-score. The indices of the arithmetic mean and p-value showed that the ADMET-score among the three data sets differed significantly. Furthermore, we learned that there was no obvious linear correlation between the ADMET-score and QED (quantitative estimate of drug-likeness). These results suggested that the ADMET-score would be a comprehensive index to evaluate chemical drug-likeness, and might be helpful for users to select appropriate drug candidates for further development.

However, in several practical tasks, it is necessary to obtain more complete information about the object from the image. In particular, for robotic apple picking, it is necessary to clearly understand where and how much to move the grabber. To determine the real position of the apple relative to the source of image registration, it is proposed to use the Intel Real Sense depth camera and aggregate information from its depth and brightness channels. The apples detection is carried out using the YOLOv3 architecture; then, based on the distance to the object and its localization in the image, the relative distances are calculated for all coordinates. In this case, to determine the coordinates of apples, a transition to a symmetric coordinate system takes place by means of simple linear transformations. Estimating the position in a symmetric coordinate system allows estimating not only the magnitude of the shift but also the location of the object relative to the camera. The proposed approach makes it possible to obtain position estimates with high accuracy. The approximate root mean square error is 7-12 mm, depending on the range and axis. As for precision and recall metrics, the first is 100% and the second is 90%.

Here, by evaluating the Mn and O states in the bulk and on the surface of Li2MnO3, we clarify that Mn( III/IV) redox dominates the reversible bulk redox in Li2MnO3, while the initial charge plateau is from surface reactions with oxygen release and carbonate decomposition. No lattice oxygen redox is involved at any electrochemical stage. The carbonate formation and decomposition indicate the catalytic property of the Li2MnO3 surface, which inspires Li-CO2/air batteries with Li2MnO3 acting as a superior electrocatalyst. The absence of lattice oxygen redox in Li2MnO3 questions the origin of the oxygen redox in Li-rich compounds, which is found to be of the same nature as that in conventional materials based on spectroscopic comparisons. These findings provide guidelines on understanding and controlling oxygen activities toward high-energy cathodes and suggest opportunities on using alkali-rich materials for catalytic reactions.

Witnessing the success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in modeling sequential data, recent works utilize RNNs to model human-skeleton motions on the observed motion sequence and predict future human motions. However, these methods disregard the existence of the spatial coherence among joints and the temporal evolution among skeletons, which reflects the crucial characteristics of human motions in spatiotemporal space. To this end, we propose a novel Skeleton-Joint Co-Attention Recurrent Neural Networks (SC-RNN) to capture the spatial coherence among joints, and the temporal evolution among skeletons simultaneously on a skeleton-joint co-attention feature map in spatiotemporal space. First, a skeleton-joint feature map is constructed as the representation of the observed motion sequence. Second, we design a new Skeleton-Joint Co-Attention (SCA) mechanism to dynamically learn a skeleton-joint co-attention feature map of this skeleton-joint feature map, which can refine the useful observed motion information to predict one future motion. Third, a variant of GRU embedded with SCA collaboratively models the human-skeleton motion and human-joint motion in spatiotemporal space by regarding the skeleton-joint co-attention feature map as the motion context. Experimental results of human motion prediction demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competing methods.

In many previous works: 1) they studied two tasks separately, neglecting internal correlations; and 2) they did not capture sufficient relations inside the body. To address these issues, we propose a symbiotic model to handle two tasks jointly; and we propose two scales of graphs to explicitly capture relations among body-joints and body-parts. Together, we propose symbiotic graph neural networks, which contain a backbone, an action-recognition head, and a motion-prediction head. Two heads are trained jointly and enhance each other. For the backbone, we propose multi-branch multiscale graph convolution networks to extract spatial and temporal features. The multiscale graph convolution networks are based on joint-scale and part-scale graphs. The joint-scale graphs contain actional graphs, capturing action-based relations, and structural graphs, capturing physical constraints. The part-scale graphs integrate body-joints to form specific parts, representing high-level relations. Moreover, dual bone-based graphs and networks are proposed to learn complementary features. We conduct extensive experiments for skeleton-based action recognition and motion prediction with four datasets, NTU-RGB+D, Kinetics, Human3.6M, and CMU Mocap. Experiments show that our symbiotic graph neural networks achieve better performances on both tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we present an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based method, which can jointly select the optimal CSR from a candidate dataset and learn a mapping to recover HSI from a single RGB image captured with this algorithmically selected camera under multi-chip or single-chip setups. Given a specific CSR, we first present a HSI recovery network, which accounts for the underlying characteristics of the HSI, including spectral nonlinear mapping and spatial similarity. Later, we append a CSR selection layer onto the recovery network, and the optimal CSR under both multi-chip and single-chip setups can thus be automatically determined from the network weights under the nonnegative sparse constraint. Experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets and two camera spectral response datasets demonstrate that our HSI recovery network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and perceptive quality, and the selection layer always returns a CSR consistent to the best one determined by exhaustive search. Finally, we show that our method can also perform well in the real capture system, and collect a hyperspectral flower dataset to evaluate the effect from HSI recovery on classification problem.

Moreover, we obtain this result after training on only one GPU. We accomplish this by breaking instance segmentation into two parallel subtasks: (1) generating a set of prototype masks and (2) predicting per-instance mask coefficients. Then we produce instance masks by linearly combining the prototypes with the mask coefficients. We find that because this process doesn't depend on repooling, this approach produces very high-quality masks and exhibits temporal stability for free. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent behavior of our prototypes and show they learn to localize instances on their own in a translation variant manner, despite being fully-convolutional. We also propose Fast NMS, a drop-in 12 ms faster replacement for standard NMS that only has a marginal performance penalty. Finally, by incorporating deformable convolutions into the backbone network, optimizing the prediction head with better anchor scales and aspect ratios, and adding a novel fast mask re-scoring branch, our YOLACT++ model can achieve 34.1 mAP on MS COCO at 33.5 fps, which is fairly close to the state-of-the-art approaches while still running at real-time.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of scene text spotting, which aims at simultaneous text detection and recognition in natural images. An end-to-end trainable neural network named as Mask TextSpotter is presented. Different from the previous text spotters that follow the pipeline consisting of a proposal generation network and a sequence-to-sequence recognition network, Mask TextSpotter enjoys a simple and smooth end-to-end learning procedure, in which both detection and recognition can be achieved directly from two-dimensional space via semantic segmentation. Further, a spatial attention module is proposed to enhance the performance and universality. Benefiting from the proposed two-dimensional representation on both detection and recognition, it easily handles text instances of irregular shapes, for instance, curved text. We evaluate it on four English datasets and one multi-language dataset, achieving consistently superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and end-to-end text recognition tasks. Moreover, we further investigate the recognition module of our method separately, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regular and irregular text datasets for scene text recognition.

Considering the intrinsic complexity and structural nature of the task, we introduce a cascaded parsing network (CP-HOI) for a multi-stage, structured HOI understanding. At each cascade stage, an instance detection module progressively refines HOI proposals and feeds them into a structured interaction reasoning module. Each of the two modules is also connected to its predecessor in the previous stage, enabling efficient cross-stage information propagation. The structured interaction reasoning module is built upon a graph parsing neural network (GPNN), which efficiently models potential HOI structures as graphs and mines rich context for comprehensive relation understanding. In particular, GPNN infers a parse graph that i) interprets meaningful HOI structures by a learnable adjacency matrix, and ii) predicts action (edge) labels. Within an end-to-end, message-passing framework, GPNN blends learning and inference, iteratively parsing HOI structures and reasoning HOI representations (i.e., instance and relation features). Further beyond relation detection at a bounding-box level, we make our framework flexible to perform fine-grained pixel-wise relation segmentation; this provides a new glimpse into better relation modeling. A preliminary version of our CP-HOI model reached 1(st) place in the ICCV2019 Person in Context Challenge, on both relation detection and segmentation. In addition, our CP-HOI shows promising results on two popular HOI recognition benchmarks, i.e., V-COCO and HICO-DET.

J	Imani, M; Ghassemian, H				Imani, Maryam; Ghassemian, Hassan			An overview on spectral and spatial information fusion for hyperspectral image classification: Current trends and challenges	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Hyperspectral image; Feature fusion; Decision fusion; Classification	JOINT COLLABORATIVE REPRESENTATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; PRESERVING PROJECTION; FRAMEWORK; AUGMENTATION; CLASSIFIERS; TRANSFORM; SUBSPACE	Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have a cube form containing spatial information in two dimensions and rich spectral information in the third one. The high volume of spectral bands allows discrimination between various materials with high details. Moreover, by utilizing the spatial features of image such as shape, texture and geometrical structures, the land cover discrimination will be improved. So, fusion of spectral and spatial information can significantly improve the HSI classification. In this work, the spectral-spatial information fusion methods are categorized into three main groups. The first group contains segmentation based methods where objects or super-pixels are used instead of pixels for classification or the obtained segmentation map is used for relaxation of the pixel-wise classification map. The second group consists of feature fusion methods which are divided into six sub-groups: features stacking, joint spectral-spatial feature extraction, kernel based classifiers, representation based classifiers, 3D spectral-spatial feature extraction and deep learning based classifiers. The third fusion methods are decision fusion based approaches where complementary information of several classifiers are contributed for achieving the final classification map. A review of different methods in each category, is presented. Moreover, the advantages and difficulties/disadvantages of each group are discussed. The performance of various fusion methods are assessed in terms of classification accuracy and running time using experiments on three popular hyperspectral images. The results show that the feature fusion methods although are time consuming but can provide superior classification accuracy compared to other methods. Study of this work can be very useful for all researchers interested in HSI feature extraction, fusion and classification.

As a type of RNN, LSTM has a good performance on processing time series data as well as some nonlinear and complex problems. To explore more accurate electricity price forecasting approach, in this paper, a new hybrid model based on wavelet transform and Adam optimized LSTM neural network, denoted as WT-Adam-LSTM, is proposed. After the wavelet transform, nonlinear sequence of electricity price can be decomposed and processed data will have a more stable variance, and the combination of Adam, one of efficient stochastic gradient-based optimizers, and LSTM can capture appropriate behaviors precisely for electricity price. This study presented four cases to verify the performance of the hybrid model, and the dataset from New South Wales of Australia and French were adopted to illustrate the excellence of the hybrid model. The results show that the proposed model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating a Widely Implemented Proprietary Deterioration Index Model among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY			English	Article						coronavirus disease; deterioration index; prediction model; validation study	HEALTH; SCORE; RISK	Rationale: The Epic Deterioration Index (EDI) is a proprietary prediction model implemented in over 100 U.S. hospitals that was widely used to support medical decision-making during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The EDI has not been independently evaluated, and other proprietary models have been shown to be biased against vulnerable populations. Objectives: To independently evaluate the EDI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 overall and in disproportionately affected subgroups. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to units other than the intensive care unit at a large academic medical center from March 9 throughMay 20, 2020. Weused the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite outcome of intensive care unit-level care, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. Results: Among 392 COVID-19 hospitalizations meeting inclusion criteria, 103 (26%) met the composite outcome. The median age of the cohort was 64 (interquartile range, 53-75) with 168 (43%) Black patients and 169 (43%) women. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the EDI was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.84). EDI predictions did not differ by race or sex. When exploring clinically relevant thresholds of the EDI, we found patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 68.8 made up 14% of the study cohort and had a 74% probability of experiencing the composite outcome during their hospitalization with a sensitivity of 39% and a median lead time of 24 hours from when this threshold was first exceeded. Among the 286 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) never exceeded an EDI of 37.9, with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity above this threshold of 91%. Conclusions: We found the EDI identifies small subsets of high-risk and low-risk patients with COVID-19 with good discrimination, although its clinical use as an early warning system is limited by low sensitivity. These findings highlight the importance of independent evaluation of proprietary models before widespread operational use among patients with COVID-19.

DeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Convolutional neural networks; semantic segmentation; atrous convolution; conditional random fields	DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; NETWORKS	In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed "DeepLab" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

M.; van Smeden, Maarten			Prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 infection: systematic review and critical appraisal	BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Review							EXPLANATION; RISK	OBJECTIVE To review and critically appraise published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at risk of being admitted to hospital for covid-19 pneumonia. DESIGN Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Embase through Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 24 March 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. DATA EXTRACTION At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). RESULTS 2696 titles were screened, and 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included. Three models were identified for predicting hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as proxy outcomes for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 infection (13 were machine learning based on computed tomography scans); and 10 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, or length of hospital stay. Only one study used patient data from outside of China. The most reported predictors of presence of covid-19 in patients with suspected disease included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. The most reported predictors of severe prognosis in patients with covid-19 included age, sex, features derived from computed tomography scans, C reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. C index estimates ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in prediction models for the general population (reported for all three models), from 0.81 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models (reported for 13 of the 18 models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in prognostic models (reported for six of the 10 models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. Most reports did not include a description of the study population or intended use of the models, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. CONCLUSION Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that proposed models are poorly reported, at high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably optimistic. Immediate sharing of well documented individual participant data from covid-19 studies is needed for collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate existing ones. The predictors identified in included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. Methodological guidance should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

Tutorial: multivariate classification for vibrational spectroscopy in biological samples	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Review							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; QUADRATIC DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; MIDINFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; FTIR-SPECTROSCOPY; MATLAB TOOLBOX; CHEMOMETRICS	Vibrational spectroscopy techniques, such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, have been successful methods for studying the interaction of light with biological materials and facilitating novel cell biology analysis. Spectrochemical analysis is very attractive in disease screening and diagnosis, microbiological studies and forensic and environmental investigations because of its low cost, minimal sample preparation, non-destructive nature and substantially accurate results. However, there is now an urgent need for multivariate classification protocols allowing one to analyze biologically derived spectrochemical data to obtain accurate and reliable results. Multivariate classification comprises discriminant analysis and class-modeling techniques where multiple spectral variables are analyzed in conjunction to distinguish and assign unknown samples to pre-defined groups. The requirement for such protocols is demonstrated by the fact that applications of deep-learning algorithms of complex datasets are being increasingly recognized as critical for extracting important information and visualizing it in a readily interpretable form. Hereby, we have provided a tutorial for multivariate classification analysis of vibrational spectroscopy data (FTIR, Raman and near-IR) highlighting a series of critical steps, such as preprocessing, data selection, feature extraction, classification and model validation. This is an essential aspect toward the construction of a practical spectrochemical analysis model for biological analysis in real-world applications, where fast, accurate and reliable classification models are fundamental. A tutorial for multivariate classification analysis of vibrational spectroscopy data (Fourier-transform infrared, Raman and near-IR) is presented. Guidelines are provided for data preprocessing, data selection, feature extraction, classification and model validation.	[Morais, Camilo L.

J	Zhao, J; Yan, SC; Feng, JS				Zhao, Jian; Yan, Shuicheng; Feng, Jiashi			Towards Age-Invariant Face Recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Age-invariant face recognition; age-invariant model; generative adversarial networks; benchmark dataset	REPRESENTATION; VERIFICATION; PATTERNS; SHAPE	Despite the remarkable progress in face recognition related technologies, reliably recognizing faces across ages remains a big challenge. The appearance of a human face changes substantially over time, resulting in significant intra-class variations. As opposed to current techniques for age-invariant face recognition, which either directly extract age-invariant features for recognition, or first synthesize a face that matches target age before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end, we propose a deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three distinct novelties. First, AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture jointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual boosting way. Second, AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with remarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties, avoiding the requirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third, effective and novel training strategies are developed for end-to-end learning of the whole deep architecture, which generates powerful age-invariant face representations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Moreover, we construct a new large-scaleCross-Age Face Recognition (CAFR) benchmark dataset to facilitate existing efforts and push the frontiers of age-invariant face recognition research. Extensive experiments on both our CAFR dataset and several other cross-age datasets (MORPH, CACD, and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts. Benchmarking our model on the popular unconstrained face recognition datasets YTFand IJB-C additionally verifies its promising generalization ability in recognizing faces in the wild.

By consistently ranking certain content higher, these algorithms may amplify some messages while reducing the visibility of others. There's been intense public and scholarly debate about the possibility that some political groups benefit more from algorithmic amplification than others. We provide quantitative evidence from a long-running, massive-scale randomized experiment on the Twitter platform that committed a randomized control group including nearly 2 million daily active accounts to a reverse-chronological content feed free of algorithmic personalization. We present two sets of findings. First, we studied tweets by elected legislators from major political parties in seven countries. Our results reveal a remarkably consistent trend: In six out of seven countries studied, the mainstream political right enjoys higher algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left. Consistent with this overall trend, our second set of findings studying the US media landscape revealed that algorithmic amplification favors right-leaning news sources. We further looked at whether algorithms amplify far-left and far-right political groups more than moderate ones; contrary to prevailing public belief, we did not find evidence to support this hypothesis. We hope our findings will contribute to an evidence-based debate on the role personalization algorithms play in shaping political content consumption.

They have important functions in cell development and metabolism, such as genetic markers, genome rearrangements, chromatin modifications, cell cycle regulation, transcription and translation. Their functions are generally closely related to their localization in the cell. Therefore, knowledge about their subcellular locations can provide very useful clues or preliminary insight into their biological functions. Although biochemical experiments could determine the localization of lncRNAs in a cell, they are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop bioinformatics tools for fast and effective identification of their subcellular locations. Results: We developed a sequence-based bioinformatics tool called 'iLoc-lncRNA' to predict the subcellular locations of LncRNAs by incorporating the 8-tuple nucleotide features into the general PseKNC (Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition) via the binomial distribution approach. Rigorous jackknife tests have shown that the overall accuracy achieved by the new predictor on a stringent benchmark dataset is 86.72%, which is over 20% higher than that by the existing state-of-the-art predictor evaluated on the same tests.

With the completion of a large number of microorganism genomics, it is urgent to predict promoters accurately in bacteria by using the computational method. In this work, a sequence-based predictor named "iPro70-PseZNC" was designed for identifying sigma70 promoters in prokaryote. In the predictor, the samples of DNA sequences are formulated by a novel pseudo nucleotide composition, called PseZNC, into which the multi-window Z-curve composition and six local DNA structural properties are incorporated. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic of 0.909 was obtained on our benchmark dataset, indicating that the proposed predictor is promising and will provide an important guide in this area. Further studies showed that the performance of PseZNC is better than it of multi-window Z-curve composition. For the sake of convenience for researchers, a user-friendly online service was established and can be freely accessible at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iPro70-PseZNC. The PseZNC approach can be also extended to other DNA-related problems.

Traditional methods hold that the motions of all persons contribute equally to the group activity, which suppresses the contributions of some relevant motions to the whole activity while overstating some irrelevant motions. To address this problem, we present a Spatio-Temporal Context Coherence (STCC) constraint and a Global Context Coherence (GCC) constraint to capture the relevant motions and quantify their contributions to the group activity, respectively. Based on this, we propose a novel Coherence Constrained Graph LSTM (CCG-LSTM) with STCC and GCC to effectively recognize group activity, by modeling the relevant motions of individuals while suppressing the irrelevant motions. Specifically, to capture the relevant motions, we build the CCG-LSTM with a temporal confidence gate and a spatial confidence gate to control the memory state updating in terms of the temporally previous state and the spatially neighboring states, respectively. In addition, an attention mechanism is employed to quantify the contribution of a certain motion by measuring the consistency between itself and the whole activity at each time step. Finally, we conduct experiments on two widely-used datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed CCG-LSTM compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Swarm Intelligence (SI), a major branch of artificial intelligence, was rendered to model the collective behavior of social swarms in nature. Ultimately, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is arguably one of the most popular SI paradigms. Over the past two decades, PSO has been applied successfully, with good return as well, in a wide variety of fields of science and technology with a wider range of complex optimization problems, thereby occupying a prominent position in the optimization field. However, through indepth studies, a number of problems with the algorithm have been detected and identified; e.g., issues regarding convergence, diversity, and stability. Consequently, since its birth in the mid-1990s, PSO has witnessed a myriad of enhancements, extensions, and variants in various aspects of the algorithm, specifically after the twentieth century, and the related research has therefore now reached an impressive state. In this paper, a rigorous yet systematic review is presented to organize and summarize the information on the PSO algorithm and the developments and trends of its most basic as well as of some of the very notable implementations that have been introduced recently, bearing in mind the coverage of paradigm, theory, hybridization, parallelization, complex optimization, and the diverse applications of the algorithm, making it more accessible. Ease for researchers to determine which PSO variant is currently best suited or to be invented for a given optimization problem or application. This up-to-date review also highlights the current pressing issues and intriguing open challenges haunting PSO, prompting scholars and researchers to conduct further research both on the theory and application of the algorithm in the forthcoming years.

The received radiance at the sensor is usually degraded by atmospheric effects and instrumental (sensor) noises which include thermal (Johnson) noise, quantization noise, and shot (photon) noise. Noise reduction is often considered as a preprocessing step for hyperspectral imagery. In the past decade, hyperspectral noise reduction techniques have evolved substantially from two dimensional bandwise techniques to three dimensional ones, and varieties of low-rank methods have been forwarded to improve the signal to noise ratio of the observed data. Despite all the developments and advances, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of these techniques and their impact on hyperspectral imagery applications. In this paper, we address the following two main issues; (1) Providing an overview of the techniques developed in the past decade for hyperspectral image noise reduction; (2) Discussing the performance of these techniques by applying them as a preprocessing step to improve a hyperspectral image analysis task, i.e., classification. Additionally, this paper discusses about the hyperspectral image modeling and denoising challenges. Furthermore, different noise types that exist in hyperspectral images have been described. The denoising experiments have confirmed the advantages of the use of low-rank denoising techniques compared to the other denoising techniques in terms of signal to noise ratio and spectral angle distance. In the classification experiments, classification accuracies have improved when denoising techniques have been applied as a preprocessing step.

However, due to the influence of the atmospheric boundary layer, wind speed exhibits strong nonlinearity and nonstationarity. Therefore, the accurate and stable prediction of wind speed is highly important for the security of the power grid. To improve the forecasting accuracy, a novel hybrid forecasting system is proposed in this paper that includes effective data decomposition techniques, recurrent neural network prediction algorithms and error decomposition correction methods. In this system, a novel decomposition approach is used to first decompose the original wind speed series into a set of subseries, then it predicts the wind speed by recurrent neural network, and finally, it decomposes the error to correct the previously predicted wind speed. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified using data from four different wind farms in China. The results show that the proposed hybrid system is superior to other single models and traditional models and realizes highly accurate prediction of wind speed. The proposed system may be a useful tool for smart grid operation and management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Solar radiation forecasting using artificial neural network and random forest methods: Application to normal beam, horizontal diffuse and global components	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Solar irradiation forecasting; ANN; Random forest; Beam solar radiation; Diffuse solar radiation; Global solar radiation	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; IRRADIANCE; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; BENCHMARKING; PREDICTION; ACCURACY; BENEFITS	Three methods, smart persistence, artificial neural network and random forest, are compared to forecast the three components of solar irradiation (global horizontal, beam normal and diffuse horizontal) measured on the site of Odeillo, France, characterized by a high meteorological variability. The objective is to predict hourly solar irradiations for time horizons from h+1 to h+6. The random forest (RF) method is the most efficient and forecasts the three components with a nRMSE from 19.65% for h+1-27.78% for h+6 for the global horizontal irradiation (all), a nRMSE from 34.11% for h+1-49.08% for h+6 for the beam normal irradiation (BNI); a nRMSE from 35.08% for h+1-49.14% for h+6 for diffuse horizontal irradiation (DHI). The improvement brought by the use of RF compared to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and smart persistence (SP) increases with the forecasting horizon. A seasonal study is realized and shows that the forecasting of solar irradiation during spring and autumn is less reliable than during winter and summer because during these periods the meteorological variability is more important.

These ecosystem services are governed by very fine-scale spatial patterning of soil carbon, nutrients, and plant species at the centimeter-to-meter scales, a phenomenon known as "islands of fertility". Such fine-scale dynamics are challenging to detect with most satellite and manned airborne platforms. Remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an alternative option for detecting fine-scale soil nutrient and plant species changes in rangelands tn0020 smaller extents. We demonstrate that a model incorporating the fusion of UAV multispectral and structure-from-motion photogrammetry classifies plant functional types and bare soil cover with an overall accuracy of 95% in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment and disturbed by fire. We further demonstrate that employing UAV hyperspectral and LiDAR fusion greatly improves upon these results by classifying 9 different plant species and soil fertility microsite types (SFMT) with an overall accuracy of 87%. Among them, creosote bush and black grama, the most important native species in the rangeland, have the highest producer's accuracies at 98% and 94%, respectively. The integration of UAV LiDAR-derived plant height differences was critical in these improvements. Finally, we use synthesis of the UAV datasets with ground-based LiDAR surveys and lab characterization of soils to estimate that the burned rangeland potentially lost 1474 kg/ha of C and 113 kg/ha of N owing to soil erosion processes during the first year after a prescribed fire. However, during the second-year post-fire, grass and plant-interspace SFMT functioned as net sinks for sediment and nutrients and gained approximately 175 kg/ha C and 14 kg/ha N, combined. These results provide important site-specific insight that is relevant to the 423 Mha of grasslands and shrublands that are burned globally each year. While fire, and specifically post-fire erosion, can degrade some rangelands, post-fire plant-soil-nutrient dynamics might provide a competitive advantage to grasses in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment. These novel UAV and ground-based LiDAR remote sensing approaches thus provide important details towards more accurate accounting of the carbon and nutrients in the soil surface of rangelands.

As efforts to control COVID-19 disease are reintensified, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these affect the loosening of interventions is crucial. We analyze aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals in the United States and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. We estimate that as of October 2020, individuals aged 20 to 49 are the only age groups sustaining resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission with reproduction numbers well above one and that at least 65 of 100 COVID-19 infections originate from individuals aged 20 to 49 in the United States. Targeting interventions-including transmission-blocking vaccines-to adults aged 20 to 49 is an important consideration in halting resurgent epidemics and preventing COVID-19-attributable deaths.

The dataset allows a cross-cultural study of psychological and behavioural responses to the Coronavirus pandemic and associated government measures like cancellation of public functions and stay at home orders implemented in many countries. The dataset contains demographic background variables as well as measures of Asian Disease Problem, perceived stress (PSS-10), availability of social provisions (SPS-10), trust in various authorities, trust in governmental measures to contain the virus (OECD trust), personality traits (BFF-15), information behaviours, agreement with the level of government intervention, and compliance with preventive measures, along with a rich pool of exploratory variables and written experiences. A global consortium from 39 countries and regions worked together to build and translate a survey with variables of shared interests, and recruited participants in 47 languages and dialects. Raw plus cleaned data and dynamic visualizations are available.

Model predictive control (MPC) can be applied to enable this vision by providing superior regulation of critical quality attributes (CQAs). For MPC, obtaining a workable system model is of fundamental importance, especially if complex process dynamics and reaction kinetics are present. Whilst physics-based models are desirable, obtaining models that are effective and fit-for-purpose may not always be practical, and industries have often relied on data-driven approaches for system identification instead. In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in MPC applications in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing. RNNs were shown to be especially well-suited for modelling dynamical systems due to their mathematical structure, and their use in system identification has enabled satisfactory closed-loop performance for MPC of a complex reaction in a single continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Ideally, such products are a useful addition to countrywide agricultural statistics since they are not politically biased and can be used to calculate cropland area for any spatial unit from an individual farm to various administrative unites (e.g., state, county, district) within and across nations, which in turn can be used to estimate agricultural productivity as well as degree of disturbance on food security from natural disasters and political conflict. However, existing cropland extent maps over large areas (e.g., Country, region, continent, world) are derived from coarse resolution imagery (250 m to 1 km pixels) and have many limitations such as missing fragmented and\or small farms with mixed signatures from different crop types and\or farming practices that can be, confused with other land cover. As a result, the coarse resolution maps have limited useflness in areas where fields are small ( < 1 ha), such as in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, coarse resolution cropland maps have known uncertainties in both geo-precision of cropland location as well as accuracies of the product. To overcome these limitations, this research was conducted using multi-date, multi-year 30-m Landsat time-series data for 3 years chosen from 2013 to 2016 for all Southeast and Northeast Asian Countries (SNACs), which included 7 refined agro-ecological zones (RAEZ) and 12 countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Japan, North Korea, Laos, South Korea, and Brunei). The 30-m (1 pixel = 0.09 ha) data from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM + ) were used in the study. Ten Landsat bands were used in the analysis (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1 SWIR2, Thermal, NDVI, NDWI, LSWI) along with additional layers of standard deviation of these 10 bands across 1 year, and global digital elevation model (GDEM)-derived slope and elevation bands. To reduce the impact of clouds, the Landsat imagery was time-composited over four time-periods (Period 1: January- April, Period 2: May-August, and Period 3: September-December) over 3-years. Period 4 was the standard deviation of all 10 bands taken over all images acquired during the 2015 calendar year. These four period composites, totaling 42 band data-cube, were generated for each of the 7 RAEZs. The reference training data (N = 7849) generated for the 7 RAEZ using sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) helped generate the knowledge-base to separate croplands from non-croplands. This knowledge-base was used to code and run a pixel-based random forest (RF) supervised machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment to separate croplands from non-croplands. The resulting cropland extent products were evaluated using an independent reference validation dataset (N = 1750) in each of the 7 RAEZs as well as for the entire SNAC area. For the entire SNAC area, the overall accuracy was 88.1% with a producer's accuracy of 81.6% (errors of omissions = 18.4%) and user's accuracy of 76.7% (errors of commissions = 23.3%). For each of the 7 RAEZs overall accuracies varied from 83.2 to 96.4%. Cropland areas calculated for the 12 countries were compared with country areas reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and other national cropland statistics resulting in an R-2 value of 0.93. The cropland areas of provinces were compared with the province statistics that showed an R-2 = 0.95 for South Korea and R-2 = 0.94 for Thailand.

Rapid triage for COVID-19 using routine clinical data for patients attending hospital: development and prospective validation of an artificial intelligence screening test	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS	Background The early clinical course of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses driving presentation to hospital. However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. Methods We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. Findings We assessed 155 689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114 957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115 394 patients, with 72 310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 77.4% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity (AUROC 0.940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >98.5%) across a range of prevalences (<= 5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 92.3% accuracy (NPV 97.6%, AUROC 0.881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 92.5% accuracy (97.7%, 0.871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 95.1%, admissions model 94.1%) and NPV (ED model 99.0%, admissions model 98.5%). Interpretation Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

In this paper, we first propose fractional-order competitive neural networks with multiple time-varying-delay links and explore the global asymptotic stability of this class of neural networks. A novel and generalized integral inequality related to every upper bound of each time-varying delay is given. Moreover, based on Lyapunov method and graph theory, we obtain some sufficient conditions with the help of this integral inequality to guarantee the global asymptotic stability. The theoretical results offer a new perspective to show the close relationship between the stability criterion and the topological structure of networks. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Understanding how global perturbations in metabolism are related to severity of AD neuropathology and the eventual expression of AD symptoms in at-risk individuals is critical to developing effective disease-modifying treatments. In this study, we undertook parallel metabolomics analyses in both the brain and blood to identify systemic correlates of neuropathology and their associations with prodromal and preclinical measures of AD progression. Methods and findings Quantitative and targeted metabolomics (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ [identification and quantification] p180) assays were performed on brain tissue samples from the autopsy cohort of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (N = 44, mean age = 81.33, % female = 36.36) from AD (N = 15), control (CN; N = 14), and "asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease" (ASYMAD, i.e., individuals with significant AD pathology but no cognitive impairment during life; N = 15) participants. Using machine-learning methods, we identified a panel of 26 metabolites from two main classes-sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids-that discriminated AD and CN samples with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 83.33%, 86.67%, and 80%, respectively. We then assayed these 26 metabolites in serum samples from two well-characterized longitudinal cohorts representing prodromal (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], N = 767, mean age = 75.19,% female = 42.63) and preclinical (BLSA) (N = 207, mean age = 78.68,% female = 42.63) AD, in which we tested their associations with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of AD-related brain atrophy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology, risk of conversion to incident AD, and trajectories of cognitive performance. We developed an integrated blood and brain endophenotype score that summarized the relative importance of each metabolite to severity of AD pathology and disease progression (Endophenotype Association Score in Early Alzheimer's Disease [EASE-AD]). Finally, we mapped the main metabolite classes emerging from our analyses to key biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. We found that distinct sphingolipid species including sphingomyelin (SM) with acyl residue sums C16: 0, C18: 1, and C16: 1 (SM C16: 0, SM C18: 1, SM C16: 1) and hydroxysphingomyelin with acyl residue sum C14: 1 (SM (OH) C14: 1) were consistently associated with severity of AD pathology at autopsy and AD progression across prodromal and preclinical stages. Higher log-transformed blood concentrations of all four sphingolipids in cognitively normal individuals were significantly associated with increased risk of future conversion to incident AD: SM C16: 0 (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.430, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.703 +/- 11.520, p = 0.002), SM C16: 1 (HR = 3.455, 95% CI = 1.516 +/- 7.873, p = 0.003), SM (OH) C14: 1 (HR = 3.539, 95% CI = 1.373 +/- 9.122, p = 0.009), and SM C18: 1 (HR = 2.255, 95% CI = 1.047 +/- 4.855, p = 0.038). The sphingolipid species identified map to several biologically relevant pathways implicated in AD, including tau phosphorylation, amyloid-beta (A beta) metabolism, calcium homeostasis, acetylcholine biosynthesis, and apoptosis. Our study has limitations: the relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited our power to detect significant associations, control for heterogeneity between groups, and replicate our findings in independent, autopsy-derived brain samples. Conclusions We present a novel framework to identify biologically relevant brain and blood metabolites associated with disease pathology and progression during the prodromal and preclinical stages of AD. Our results show that perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism are consistently associated with endophenotypes across preclinical and prodromal AD, as well as with AD pathology at autopsy. Sphingolipids may be biologically relevant biomarkers for the early detection of AD, and correcting perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism may be a plausible and novel therapeutic strategy in AD.

The paper investigates the evolution characteristics of these landslides and presents a novel forecasting model for their displacements. The distribution characteristics and behavior of landslides developed along Xiangxi River is revealed by the database of landslides in the larger Zigui basin, of which this area is part. Most landslides occur at rather low elevations of <300 m and in areas of moderate rainfall. The geological evolution of landslides in the Xiangxi River valley can be divided into four stages, beginning with anticline formation, followed by valley incision, then by weathering and erosion, and culminating in formation of the colluvial landslides. The accumulative displacement curves of landslides with a stair-step sliding surface in Xiangxi River region also present obvious, step-like characteristics. A novel GA-CEEMD-RF algorithm was developed to predict the displacement of these stair-step landslides, which helps to define the combination of induced factors and weak stableness of prediction results using a single displacement prediction model and the multi-field monitoring data.

However, currently released datasets are so small-scale that they can not meet the needs of the supervised CNN-based algorithms. To remedy this problem, we construct a large-scale congested crowd counting and localization dataset, NWPU-Crowd, consisting of 5,109 images, in a total of 2,133,375 annotated heads with points and boxes. Compared with other real-world datasets, it contains various illumination scenes and has the largest density range (0 similar to 20; 033). Besides, a benchmark website is developed for impartially evaluating the different methods, which allows researchers to submit the results of the test set. Based on the proposed dataset, we further describe the data characteristics, evaluate the performance of some mainstream state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and analyze the new problems that arise on the new data. What's more, the benchmark is deployed at https://www.crowdbenchmark.com/, and the dataset/code/models/results are available at https://gjy3035.github.io/ NWPU-Crowd-Sample-Code/	[Wang, Qi; Gao, Junyu; Lin, Wei; Li, Xuelong] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qi; Gao, Junyu; Lin, Wei; Li, Xuelong] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ctr Opt Imagery Anal & Learning OPTIMAL, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China		Li, XL (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Li, XL (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ctr Opt Imagery Anal & Learning OPTIMAL, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.	crabwq@gmail.com; gjy3035@gmail.com; elonlin24@gmail.com; li@nwpu.edu.cn	Gao, Junyu/GLU-4957-2022	Wang, Qi/0000-0002-7028-4956; Lin, Wei/0000-0001-8425-956X	National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB1002202]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1864204, 61773316, U1801262, 61871470]	National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2017YFB1002202, National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U1864204, 61773316, U1801262, and 61871470.		46	85	86	10	10	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA	0162-8828	1939-3539		IEEE T PATTERN ANAL	IEEE Trans.

In the past few decades, plenty of works have been conducted on this topic, but most of them have limitations due to the insufficient utilization of crowd properties and the arbitrary processing of individuals. In this study, a Multiview-based Parameter Free framework (MPF) is proposed. Based on the L1-norm and L2-norm, we design two versions of the multiview clustering method, which is the main part of the proposed framework. This paper presents the contributions on three aspects: (1) a new structural context descriptor is designed to characterize the structural properties of individuals in crowd scenes; (2) a self-weighted multiview clustering method is proposed to cluster feature points by incorporating their orientation and context similarities; and (3) a novel framework is introduced for group detection, which is able to determine the group number automatically without any parameter or threshold to be tuned. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated on real-world crowd videos, and the experimental results show its promising performance on group detection. In addition, the proposed multiview clustering method is also evaluated on a synthetic dataset and several standard benchmarks, and its superiority over the state-of-the-art competitors is demonstrated.

Therefore, producing susceptibility maps for flood management are necessary in order to reduce its harmful effects. The aim of the present study is to map flood hazard over the Jahrom Township in Fars Province using a combination of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) with different metaheuristics algorithms such as ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and comparing their accuracy. A total number of 53 flood locations areas were identified, 35 locations of which were randomly selected in order to model flood susceptibility and the remaining 16 locations were used to validate the models. Learning vector quantization (LVQ), as one of the supervised neural network methods, was employed in order to estimate factors' importance. Nine flood conditioning factors namely: slope degree, plan curvature, altitude, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), distance from river, land use/land cover, rainfall, and lithology were selected and the corresponding maps were prepared in ArcGIS. The frequency ratio (FR) model was used to assign weights to each class within particular controlling factor, then the weights was transferred into MATLAB software for further analyses and to combine with metaheuristic models. The ANFIS-PSO was found to be the most practical model in term of producing the highly focused flood susceptibility map with lesser spatial distribution related to highly susceptible classes. The chi-square result attests the same, where the ANFIS-PSO had the highest spatial differentiation within flood susceptibility classes over the study area. The area under the curve (AUC) obtained from ROC curve indicated the accuracy of 91.4%, 91.8%, 92.6% and 94.5% for the respective models of FR, ANFIS-ACO, ANFIS-GA, and ANFIS-PSO ensembles. So, the ensemble of ANFIS-PSO was introduced as the premier model in the study area. Furthermore, LVQ results revealed that slope degree, rainfall, and altitude were the most effective factors. As regards the premier model, a total area of 44.74% was recognized as highly susceptible to flooding. The results of this study can be used as a platform for better land use planning in order to manage the highly susceptible zones to flooding and reduce the anticipated losses. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fiscon, G; Conte, F; Farina, L; Paci, P				Fiscon, Giulia; Conte, Federica; Farina, Lorenzo; Paci, Paola			SAveRUNNER: A network-based algorithm for drug repurposing and its application to COVID-19	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							SARS; PHARMACOGENOMICS; CHLOROQUINE; KNOWLEDGE	The novelty of new human coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these strategies rely on the repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14 selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic similarity (i.e., SARS), comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular diseases), or for their association to drugs tentatively repurposed to treat COVID-19 (e.g., malaria, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis). Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19 treatments (e.g., chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, heparin), as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir), actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies (e.g., anti-IFN gamma, anti-TNF alpha, anti-IL12, anti-IL1 beta, anti-IL6), and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect against human coronavirus infections. Author summary The global pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) leads a compelling need to find new therapeutic options devoted to fight the disease progression in the short term and to prevent it from happening in the future. The strategy of reusing an 'old drug' for new therapeutic purposes (known as drug repurposing) appears as a powerful solution for emerging diseases, such as COVID-19, since it allows to shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this context, we propose SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), a new network-medicine-based algorithm for drug repurposing, with the aim to offer a promising framework to efficiently screen potential novel medical indications for various drugs, which are already approved and used in clinical practice, against the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2). Our computational analysis predicts several repurposable drugs, including some of the most rumored off-label drugs for COVID-19 treatments as well as new promising candidates worthy of further exploration.

The approach consists of two steps: it first estimates a 2D pose from an image and then estimates the corresponding 3D pose. This paper focuses on the second step. Graph convolutional network (GCN) has recently become the de facto standard for human pose related tasks such as action recognition. However, in this work, we show that GCN has critical limitations when it is used for 3D pose estimation due to the inherent weight sharing scheme. The limitations are clearly exposed through a novel reformulation of GCN, in which both GCN and Fully Connected Network (FCN) are its special cases. In addition, on top of the formulation, we present locally connected network (LCN) to overcome the limitations of GCN by allocating dedicated rather than shared filters for different joints. We jointly train the LCN network with a 2D pose estimator such that it can handle inaccurate 2D poses. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets and observe that LCN outperforms GCN, FCN, and the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. More importantly, it demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization ability because of sparse connections among body joints.

However, this deterministic-based algorithm does not present stable performance owing to the experiential selection of its orders and layers. For determining the selection of WTs orders and layers in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, this paper designs a crossover experiment with 240 schemes of WT parameter selection and forecasts each scheme with stacked autoencoder (SAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM), generating a novel hybrid model WT-SAE-LSTM. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other AI models, such as back propagation neural network et al., in forecasting accuracy. The best performance of WT-SAE-LSTM in residential, commercial, and industrial electricity price cases obtained by five order four layers, five order four layers, and four order seven layers, where the MAPE is 0.8606%, 0.4719%, and 0.4956%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the proposed forecasting model and the forecasting result of Energy Information Administration (U.S.) is small. This paper determines the optimal orders and layers of WT in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, which provides an effective reference for the application of WT in other forecasting scenarios and for electricity market participants.

Beyond the assumption of unconfoundedness, however, these methods also require the model for the propensity score to be correctly specified. The recently proposed covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) methodology increases the robustness to model misspecification by directly optimizing sample covariate balance between the treatment and control groups. In this paper, we extend the CBPS to a continuous treatment. We propose the covariate balancing generalized propensity score (CBGPS) methodology, which minimizes the association between covariates and the treatment. We develop both parametric and non-parametric approaches and show their superior performance over the standard maximum likelihood estimation in a simulation study. The CBGPS methodology is applied to an observational study, whose goal is to estimate the causal effects of political advertisements on campaign contributions. We also provide open-source software that implements the proposed methods.

Despite intensive drug discovery efforts, no new classes of antibiotics have been developed into new medicines for decades, in large part owing to the stringent chemical, biological and pharmacological requisites for effective antibiotic drugs. Combinations of antibiotics and of antibiotics with non-antibiotic activity-enhancing compounds offer a productive strategy to address the widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In this Review, we outline a theoretical and practical framework for the development of effective antibiotic combinations.

In order to enhance the accuracy of short-term wind speed prediction, a hybrid model based on VMD-WT and PCA-BP-RBF neural network is proposed. In data pre-processing period, the non-stationary wind speed sequence is decomposed into a number of relatively stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by variational mode decomposition (VMD); then WT algorithm is used to perform secondary denoising on each IMF. At the same time, several factors affecting wind speed are introduced, from which the input features that participated in the prediction are selected by PCA-BP method. Next, the RBF neural network is utilized to predict each IMF. Finally, all IMF prediction results are aggregated to obtain the final wind speed value. Combining the data of Spanish and Chinese wind farms, the experiment results show that: (1) compared with EMD, VMD-WT can better solve the problems of modal aliasing and endpoint effect, which can make the periodic characteristics of each IMF more obvious, then promote the forecasting performance; (2) using PCA-BP method to filter the model input data, the redundant and irrelevant information is eliminated, the complexity of the model is reduced, and the predictive performance of RBF model is improved; (3) compared with other traditional models, the hybrid model proposed in this paper has greatly improved the accuracy in short-term wind speed forecasting.

The accurate prediction of carbon prices is an active topic of research. However, many previous studies have focused on the application of a single model, ignoring the application of combination strategies. In this study, a hybrid forecasting system that includes error correction strategy and divide-conquer strategy is designed to predict the carbon price series accurately. Specifically, the main framework of this article comprises four modules. Data preprocessing module of the divide and conquer strategy is proposed. Next, the optimization module uses a multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm to enhance the performance of the prediction module. Then, the error correction module predicts the error sequence and corrects the model results. To verify the performance of the established hybrid forecasting system, experiments were performed using two real carbon price series from China and European Union emissions trading schemes, and the results showed that the mean absolute percentage errors of the system were 2.7793% and 0.6720%, respectively, which are better than the other benchmark methods considered. Moreover, it was proved that the designed forecasting system provides a new, effective, and feasible solution for carbon price forecasting. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes Renyi's entropy multi-threshold image segmentation based on an improved Slime Mould Algorithm (DASMA). First, we introduce the diffusion mechanism (DM) into the original SMA to increase the population's diversity so that the variants can better avoid falling into local optima. The association strategy (AS) is then added to help the algorithm find the optimal solution faster. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to Renyi's entropy multilevel threshold image segmentation based on non-local means 2D histogram. The proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated on the Berkeley segmentation dataset and benchmark (BSD) by comparing it with some well-known algorithms. The DASMA-based multilevel threshold segmentation technique is also successfully applied to the CT image segmentation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The experimental results are evaluated by image quality metrics, which show the proposed algorithm's extraordinary performance. This means that it can help doctors analyze the lesion tissue qualitatively and quantitatively, improve its diagnostic accuracy and make the right treatment plan.

First, a landslide inventory map with 93 landslide locations was randomly divided, with 70% of the area used for training landslide models and 30% used for the validation process. A spatial database of 14 conditioning factors was constructed under a geographic information system environment. Subsequently, the ReliefF method was employed to assess the prediction capability of the conditioning factors in landslide models. Multicollinearity of these factors was verified using the variance inflation factor, tolerance, and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Finally, the three resulting models were evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, standard error, 95% confidence interval, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The random forest model showed the AUROC values (0.869), smallest standard error (0.025), narrowest 95% confidence interval (0.819-0.918), highest accuracy value (0.774), highest precision (0.662), and highest F-measure (0.662) for the training dataset. Thus, the random forest model is a promising technique that could be used for landslide susceptibility mapping. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An online big data-driven oil consumption forecasting model is proposed that uses Google trends, which finely reflect various related factors based on a myriad of search results. This model involves two main steps, relationship investigation and prediction improvement. First, cointegration tests and a Granger causality analysis are conducted in order to statistically test the predictive power of Google trends, in terms of having a significant relationship with oil consumption. Second, the effective Google trends are introduced into popular forecasting methods for predicting both oil consumption trends and values. The experimental study of global oil consumption prediction confirms that the proposed online big-data-driven forecasting work with Google trends improves on the traditional techniques without Google trends significantly, for both directional and level predictions.

Adversarial domain adaptation to reduce sample bias of a high energy physics event classifier	MACHINE LEARNING-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						adversarial training; adversarial neural network; domain adaptation; LHC; ttH		We apply adversarial domain adaptation in unsupervised setting to reduce sample bias in a supervised high energy physics events classifier training. We make use of a neural network containing event and domain classifier with a gradient reversal layer to simultaneously enable signal versus background events classification on the one hand, while on the other hand minimizing the difference in response of the network to background samples originating from different Monte Carlo models via adversarial domain classification loss. We show the successful bias removal on the example of simulated events at the Large Hadron Collider with t (t) over barH signal versus t (t) over barb (b) over bar background classification and discuss implications and limitations of the method.

J	Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R; Tibshirani, R				Hastie, Trevor; Tibshirani, Robert; Tibshirani, Ryan			Best Subset, Forward Stepwise or Lasso? Analysis and Recommendations Based on Extensive Comparisons	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Regression; selection; penalization	VARIABLE SELECTION; FREEDOM	In exciting recent work, Bertsimas, King and Mazumder (Ann. Statist. 44 (2016) 813-852) showed that the classical best subset selection problem in regression modeling can be formulated as a mixed integer optimization (MIO) problem. Using recent advances in MIO algorithms, they demonstrated that best subset selection can now be solved at much larger problem sizes than what was thought possible in the statistics community. They presented empirical comparisons of best subset with other popular variable selection procedures, in particular, the lasso and forward stepwise selection. Surprisingly (to us), their simulations suggested that best subset consistently outperformed both methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Here, we present an expanded set of simulations to shed more light on these comparisons. The summary is roughly as follows: neither best subset nor the lasso uniformly dominate the other, with best subset generally performing better in very high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regimes, and the lasso better in low SNR regimes; for a large proportion of the settings considered, best subset and forward stepwise perform similarly, but in certain cases in the high SNR regime, best subset performs better; forward stepwise and best subsets tend to yield sparser models (when tuned on a validation set), especially in the high SNR regime; the relaxed lasso (actually, a simplified version of the original relaxed estimator defined in Meinshausen (Comput. Statist. Data Anal. 52 (2007) 374-393)) is the overall winner, performing just about as well as the lasso in low SNR scenarios, and nearly as well as best subset in high SNR scenarios.

The health indicator was extracted based on the partial charge voltage curve of cells. Battery remaining useful life was predicted using a linear aging model constructed based on the capacity data within a moving window, combined with Monte Carlo simulation to generate prediction uncertainties. Both the developed capacity estimation and remaining useful life prediction methods were implemented based on a real battery management system used in electric vehicles. Experimental data for cells tested at different current rates, including 1 and 2 C, and different temperatures, including 25 and 40 degrees C, were collected and used. The implementation results show that the capacity estimation errors were within 1.5%. During the last 20% of battery lifetime, the root-mean-square errors of remaining useful life predictions were within 20 cycles, and the 95% confidence intervals mainly cover about 20 cycles.

The traditional training of neural networks depends generally on the error back propagation method to iteratively tune all the parameters. When the number of hidden layers increases, this kind of training has many problems such as slow convergence, time consuming, and local minima. To avoid these problems, neural networks with random weights (NNRW) are proposed in which the weights between the hidden layer and input layer are randomly selected and the weights between the output layer and hidden layer are obtained analytically. Researchers have shown that NNRW has much lower training complexity in comparison with the traditional training of feed-forward neural networks. This paper objectively reviews the advantages and disadvantages of NNRW model, tries to reveal the essence of NNRW, gives our comments and remarks on NNRW, and provides some useful guidelines for users to choose a mechanism to train a feed-forward neural network.

Electricity price is becoming increasingly crucial for balancing electricity generation and consumption. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, denoted as DE LSTM, is used for electricity price prediction. Several recent studies have adopted LSTM with considerable success in certain applications, such as text recognition and speech recognition. However, problems in the application of LSTM to solving nonlinear regression and time series problems have been encountered. DE, a novel evolutionary algorithm that effectively obtains optimal solutions, is designed to identify suitable hyperparameters for LSTM. Experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the DE LSTM model under the electricity prices in New South Wales, Germany/Austria, and France. Results indicate that the proposed DE LSTM model outperforms existing forecasting models in terms of forecasting accuracies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a novel fractional-order model for a battery, which considers both Butler-Volmer equation and fractional calculus of constant phase element. The structure characteristics of the proposed model are then analyzed, and a novel identification method, which combines least squares and nonlinear optimization algorithm, is proposed. The method is proven to be efficient and accurate. Based on the proposed model, a fractional-order unscented Kalman filter is developed to estimate SOC, while singular value decomposition is applied to tackle the nonlinearity of Butler-Volmer equation and fractional calculus of constant phase element. The systematic comparison between the proposed model and traditional fractional order model is carried out on two LiNiMnCo lithium-ion batteries at different temperatures, ageing levels, and electric vehicle current profiles. The comparison results show that the proposed model has higher estimation accuracy in battery terminal voltage and SOC than the traditional model over wide range of temperature and ageing level under electric vehicle operation conditions. Furthermore, the hardware-in-the-loop test validates that the proposed SOC estimation method is suitable for SOC estimation in electric vehicles.

Promoters have various types with different functions. Owing to their importance in biological process, it is highly desired to develop computational tools for timely identifying promoters and their types. Such a challenge has become particularly critical and urgent in facing the avalanche of DNA sequences discovered in the postgenomic age. Although some prediction methods were developed, they can only be used to discriminate a specific type of promoters from non-promoters. None of them has the ability to identify the types of promoters. This is due to the facts that different types of promoters may share quite similar consensus sequence pattern, and that the promoters of same type may have considerably different consensus sequences. Results: To overcome such difficulty, using the multi-window-based PseKNC (pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition) approach to incorporate the short-, middle-, and long-range sequence information, we have developed a two-layer seamless predictor named as 'iPromoter-2 L'. The first layer serves to identify a query DNA sequence as a promoter or non-promoter, and the second layer to predict which of the following six types the identified promoter belongs to: r24, r28, r32, r38, r54 and r70. Availability and implementation: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly and publicly accessible web-server for the powerful new predictor has been established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iPromoter-2L/. It is anticipated that iPromoter-2 L will become a very useful high throughput tool for genome analysis.

STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Computational statistics; nonparametric statistics; probabilistic numerics; uncertainty quantification	MONTE-CARLO; THERMODYNAMIC INTEGRATION; BAYES FACTORS; QUADRATURE	A research frontier has emerged in scientific computation, wherein discretisation error is regarded as a source of epistemic uncertainty that can be modelled. This raises several statistical challenges, including the design of statistical methods that enable the coherent propagation of probabilities through a (possibly deterministic) computational work-flow, in order to assess the impact of discretisation error on the computer output. This paper examines the case for probabilistic numerical methods in routine statistical computation. Our focus is on numerical integration, where a probabilistic integrator is equipped with a full distribution over its output that reflects the fact that the integrand has been discretised. Our main technical contribution is to establish, for the first time, rates of posterior contraction for one such method. Several substantial applications are provided for illustration and critical evaluation, including examples from statistical modelling, computer graphics and a computer model for an oil reservoir.

The evidential belief function (EBF)-based function tree (FT), logistic regression (LR), and logistic model tree (LMT) were applied to Nanchuan District, China. Firstly, an inventory with 298 landslides was compiled and separated into two parts (70%: 209; 30%: 89) as training and validation datasets. Then, based on the EBF method, theBelvalues of 16 conditioning factors related to landslide occurrence were calculated, and theseBelvalues were used as input data for building other models. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the values of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to evaluate and compare the prediction ability of the four models. All the models achieved good results and performed well. In particular, the LMT model had the best performance (0.847 and 0.765, obtained from the training and validation datasets, respectively). This paper also demonstrates the superiority of integration and optimization of models in landslide susceptibility evaluation. Finally, the best classification method was selected to draw landslide susceptibility maps, which may be helpful for government administrators and engineers to carry out land design and planning.

MXenes 2D flakes have n + 1 (n = 1-4) atomic layers of transition metals interleaved by carbon/nitrogen layers, but to-date remain limited in composition to one or two transition metals. In this study, by implementing four transition metals, we report the synthesis of multi-principal-element high-entropy M4C3Tx MXenes. Specifically, we introduce two high-entropy MXenes, TiVNbMoC3Tx and TiVCrMoC3Tx, as well as their precursor TiVNbMoAlC3 and TiVCrMoAlC3 high-entropy MAX phases. We used a combination of real and reciprocal space characterization (X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy) to establish the structure, phase purity, and equimolar distribution of the four transition metals in high-entropy MAX and MXene phases. We use first-principles calculations to compute the formation energies and explore synthesizability of these high-entropy MAX phases. We also show that when three transition metals are used instead of four, under similar synthesis conditions to those of the four-transition-metal MAX phase, two different MAX phases can be formed (i.e., no pure single-phase forms). This finding indicates the importance of configurational entropy in stabilizing the desired single-phase high-entropy MAX over multiphases of MAX, which is essential for the synthesis of phase-pure high-entropy MXenes. The synthesis of high-entropy MXenes significantly expands the compositional variety of the MXene family to further tune their properties, including electronic, magnetic, electrochemical, catalytic, high temperature stability, and mechanical behavior.

Sandeep; Lal, Chhagan; Ruj, Sushmita			A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues of Bitcoin	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS			English	Article						Bitcoins; cryptocurrency; security threats; user privacy	BLOCKCHAIN; ATTACKS	Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.

In this article, we propose a novel dynamic saliency network based on both local consistency and global discriminations, via which semantic features across video frames are simultaneously extracted and a recurrent feature optimization structure is designed to further enhance its performances. To ensure that the generated dynamic salient map is more concentrated, we design a lightweight discriminator with a local consistency loss LC to identify subtle differences between predicted maps and ground truths. As a result, the proposed network can be further stimulated to produce more realistic saliency maps with smoother boundaries and simpler layer transitions. The added LC loss forces the network to pay more attention to the local consistency between continuous saliency maps. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out on three large datasets, and the results demonstrate that our proposed network not only achieves improved performances but also shows good robustness.

We introduce some notions, such as picture fuzzy ideal point, the modules of picture fuzzy numbers. We also introduce the cosine of the included angle between the attribute value vectors of each alternative and the picture fuzzy ideal point. Then we establish the projection model to measure the similarity degrees between each alternative and the picture fuzzy ideal point. Based on the projection models, we can rank the given alternatives and then select the most desirable one. Finally, we illustrate the developed projection models with a numerical example for potential evaluation of emerging technology commercialization.

J	Mohamed, AW; Hadi, AA; Mohamed, AK				Mohamed, Ali Wagdy; Hadi, Anas A.; Mohamed, Ali Khater			Gaining-sharing knowledge based algorithm for solving optimization problems: a novel nature-inspired algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Evolutionary computation; Global optimization; Meta-heuristics; Nature-inspired algorithms; Population-based algorithm	META-HEURISTIC OPTIMIZATION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH ALGORITHM; SWARM; DESIGN; EVOLUTION; SYSTEM; COLONY; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS	This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired algorithm called Gaining Sharing Knowledge based Algorithm (GSK) for solving optimization problems over continuous space. The GSK algorithm mimics the process of gaining and sharing knowledge during the human life span. It is based on two vital stages, junior gaining and sharing phase and senior gaining and sharing phase. The present work mathematically models these two phases to achieve the process of optimization. In order to verify and analyze the performance of GSK, numerical experiments on a set of 30 test problems from the CEC2017 benchmark for 10, 30, 50 and 100 dimensions. Besides, the GSK algorithm has been applied to solve the set of real world optimization problems proposed for the IEEE-CEC2011 evolutionary algorithm competition. A comparison with 10 state-of-the-art and recent metaheuristic algorithms are executed. Experimental results indicate that in terms of robustness, convergence and quality of the solution obtained, GSK is significantly better than, or at least comparable to state-of-the-art approaches with outstanding performance in solving optimization problems especially with high dimensions.

The 2020 magnetism roadmap	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article						applied magnetism; magnetic materials; magnetic phenomena; novel applications of magnetism	DYNAMICS DRIVEN; SPIN DYNAMICS; FILMS; STATE; MAGNETIZATION; REVERSAL; EMITTERS; DESIGN; LOGIC; BEAM	Andreas BergerCICnanoGUNE BRTA Following the success and relevance of the 2014 and 2017 Magnetism Roadmap articles, this 2020 Magnetism Roadmap edition takes yet another timely look at newly relevant and highly active areas in magnetism research. The overall layout of this article is unchanged, given that it has proved the most appropriate way to convey the most relevant aspects of today's magnetism research in a wide variety of sub-fields to a broad readership. A different group of experts has again been selected for this article, representing both the breadth of new research areas, and the desire to incorporate different voices and viewpoints. The latter is especially relevant for thistype of article, in which one's field of expertise has to be accommodated on two printed pages only, so that personal selection preferences are naturally rather more visible than in other types of articles. Most importantly, the very relevant advances in the field of magnetism research in recent years make the publication of yet another Magnetism Roadmap a very sensible and timely endeavour, allowing its authors and readers to take another broad-based, but concise look at the most significant developments in magnetism, their precise status, their challenges, and their anticipated future developments. While many of the contributions in this 2020 Magnetism Roadmap edition have significant associations with different aspects of magnetism, the general layout can nonetheless be classified in terms of three main themes: (i) phenomena, (ii) materials and characterization, and (iii) applications and devices. While these categories are unsurprisingly rather similar to the 2017 Roadmap, the order is different, in that the 2020 Roadmap considers phenomena first, even if their occurrences are naturally very difficult to separate from the materials exhibiting such phenomena. Nonetheless, the specifically selected topics seemed to be best displayed in the order presented here, in particular, because many of the phenomena or geometries discussed in (i) can be found or designed into a large variety of materials, so that the progression of the article embarks from more general concepts to more specific classes of materials in the selected order. Given that applications and devices are based on both phenomena and materials, it seemed most appropriate to close the article with the application and devices section (iii) once again. The 2020 Magnetism Roadmap article contains 14 sections, all of which were written by individual authors and experts, specifically addressing a subject in terms of its status, advances, challenges and perspectives in just two pages. Evidently, this two-page format limits the depth to which each subject can be described. Nonetheless, the most relevant and key aspects of each field are touched upon, which enables the Roadmap as whole to give its readership an initial overview of and outlook into a wide variety of topics and fields in a fairly condensed format. Correspondingly, the Roadmap pursues the goal of giving each reader a brief reference frame of relevant and current topics in modern applied magnetism research, even if not all sub-fields can be represented here. The first block of this 2020 Magnetism Roadmap, which is focussed on (i) phenomena, contains five contributions, which address the areas of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and two-dimensional and curvilinear magnetism, as well as spin-orbit torque phenomena and all optical magnetization reversal. All of these contributions describe cutting edge aspects of rather fundamental physical processes and properties, associated with new and improved magnetic materials' properties, together with potential developments in terms of future devices and technology. As such, they form part of a widening magnetism 'phenomena reservoir' for utilization in applied magnetism and related device technology. The final block (iii) of this article focuses on such applications and device-related fields in four contributions relating to currently active areas of research, which are of course utilizing magnetic phenomena to enable specific functions. These contributions highlight the role of magnetism or spintronics in the field of neuromorphic and reservoir computing, terahertz technology, and domain wall-based logic. One aspect common to all of these application-related contributions is that they are not yet being utilized in commercially available technology; it is currently still an open question, whether or not such technological applications will be magnetism-based at all in the future, or if other types of materials and phenomena will yet outperform magnetism. This last point is actually a very good indication of the vibrancy of applied magnetism research today, given that it demonstrates that magnetism research is able to venture into novel application fields, based upon its portfolio of phenomena, effects and materials. This materials portfolio in particular defines the central block (ii) of this article, with its five contributions interconnecting phenomena with devices, for which materials and the characterization of their properties is the decisive discriminator between purely academically interesting aspects and the true viability of real-life devices, because only available materials and their associated fabrication and characterization methods permit reliable technological implementation. These five contributions specifically address magnetic films and multiferroic heterostructures for the purpose of spin electronic utilization, multi-scale materials modelling, and magnetic materials design based upon machine-learning, as well as materials characterization via polarized neutron measurements. As such, these contributions illustrate the balanced relevance of research into experimental and modelling magnetic materials, as well the importance of sophisticated characterization methods that allow for an ever-more refined understanding of materials. As a combined and integrated article, this 2020 Magnetism Roadmap is intended to be a reference point for current, novel and emerging research directions in modern magnetism, just as its 2014 and 2017 predecessors have been in previous years.

We present a deformable artificial multimodal ionic receptor that can differentiate thermal and mechanical information without signal interference. Two variables are derived from the analysis of the ion relaxation dynamics: the charge relaxation time as a strain-insensitive intrinsic variable to measure absolute temperature and the normalized capacitance as a temperature-insensitive extrinsic variable to measure strain. The artificial receptor with a simple electrode-electrolyte-electrode structure simultaneously detects temperature and strain by measuring the variables at only two measurement frequencies. The human skin-like multimodal receptor array, called multimodal ionelectronic skin (IEM-skin), provides real-time force directions and strain profiles in various tactile motions (shear, pinch, spread, torsion, and so on).

Docking enables the identification of novel compounds of therapeutic interest, predicting ligand-target interactions at a molecular level, or delineating structure-activity relationships (SAR), without knowing a priori the chemical structure of other target modulators. Although it was originally developed to help understanding the mechanisms of molecular recognition between small and large molecules, uses and applications of docking in drug discovery have heavily changed over the last years. In this review, we describe how molecular docking was firstly applied to assist in drug discovery tasks. Then, we illustrate newer and emergent uses and applications of docking, including prediction of adverse effects, polypharmacology, drug repurposing, and target fishing and profiling, discussing also future applications and further potential of this technique when combined with emergent techniques, such as artificial intelligence.

With the efforts of researchers around the world, LIBS has been developed by leaps and bounds. Moreover, in recent years, more and more Chinese LIBS researchers have put tremendous energy in promoting LIBS applications. It is worth mentioning that the application of LIBS in a specific field has its special application background and technical difficulties, therefore it may develop in different stages. A review summarizing the current development status of LIBS in various fields would be helpful for the development of LIBS technology as well as its applications especially for Chinese LIBS community since most of the researchers in this field work in application. In the present work, we summarized the research status and latest progress of main research groups in coal, metallurgy, and water, etc. Based on the current research status, the challenges and opportunities of LIBS were evaluated, and suggestions were made to further promote LIBS applications.

Common applications include public safety situations, where the risk is represented by dwellings built near active landslides or unstable cut slopes that threaten streets and railways, and open-pit mines, for which accurate warnings are fundamental to safeguard workers and simultaneously avoid unnecessary interruptions of the extraction activities. The scientific literature is populated by many methods, guidelines and approaches regarding forecasting the time of failure or defining the conditions of imminent collapse. Thus, obtaining a synoptic view of the advantages and limitations of these different methodologies has become difficult. At the same time, innovations in technology have opened new possibilities to the application of such techniques, which are examined here. This paper discusses and classifies these methods, addressing their respective differences and peculiarities to foster the usage even of less popular methods without overlooking the more scientific aspects and issues of landslide forecasting. Finally, an overview of the future trends and challenges is presented to contribute to the debate around this important topic.

In this context, artificial intelligence and generative models have been used for molecular de novo design and compound optimization. Herein, we report a generative model that bridges systems biology and molecular design, conditioning a generative adversarial network with transcriptomic data. By doing so, we can automatically design molecules that have a high probability to induce a desired transcriptomic profile. As long as the gene expression signature of the desired state is provided, this model is able to design active-like molecules for desired targets without any previous target annotation of the training compounds. Molecules designed by this model are more similar to active compounds than the ones identified by similarity of gene expression signatures. Overall, this method represents an alternative approach to bridge chemistry and biology in the long and difficult road of drug discovery.

In recent years, data-driven models based on past observations have been widely employed in the literature. Various types of data processing methods are successfully applied to assist these models and further improve forecasting performance. Comprehensive research of their methodologies is called on for a thorough understanding of current challenges that affect model accuracy and efficiency. To address the knowledge gap, this paper presents an exhaustive review and categorization of data processing in wind energy forecasting. The utilized techniques are classified into seven categories according to the applications: decomposition, feature selection, feature extraction, denoising, residual error modeling, outlier detection, and filter-based correction. An overall analysis of their intentions, positions, characteristics, and implementation details is provided. A general evaluation is carried out from different perspectives including accuracy improvement, usage frequency, consuming time, robustness to parameters, maturity, and implementation difficulty. Among the existing data processing methods, outlier detection and filter-based correction are relatively less used. Their potential can be better explored in the future. Furthermore, some possible research directions and challenges of data processing in wind energy forecasting are provided, in order to encourage subsequent research.

Variable (wavelength) selection is a critical step in multivariate calibration of NIR spectra, which can improve the prediction performance, make the calibration reliable and provide simpler interpretation. During the last several decades, there have been a large number of variable selection methods proposed in NIR spectroscopy. In this paper, we generalize variable selection methods in a simple manner to introduce their classifications, merits and drawbacks, to provide a better understanding of their characteristics, similarities and differences. We also introduce some hybrid and modified methods, highlighting their improvements. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing variable selection methods, providing our remarks and suggestions on the development of variable selection methods, to promote the development of NIR spectroscopy.

The focus of the present review is on the regression of atomistic properties: in particular, on the construction of interatomic potentials, or force fields, in the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) framework; beyond this, we also discuss the fitting of arbitrary scalar, vectorial, and tensorial quantities. Methodological aspects of reference data generation, representation, and regression, as well as the question of how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically discussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions in chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in the field.

The false hope of current approaches to explainable artificial in health care	LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH			English	Article							AUTOMATION BIAS; INTELLIGENCE	The black-box nature of current artificial intelligence (AI) has caused some to question whether AI must be explainable to be used in high-stakes scenarios such as medicine. It has been argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI decision making process, and potentially mitigate various kinds of bias. In this Viewpoint, we argue that this argument represents a false hope for explainable AI and that current explainability methods are unlikely to achieve these goals for patient-level decision support. We provide an overview of current explainability techniques and highlight how various failure cases can cause problems for decision making for individual patients. In the absence of suitable explainability methods, we advocate for rigorous internal and external validation of AI models as a more direct means of achieving the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution against having explainability be a requirement for clinically deployed models.

However, the recent introduction of smart grids and renewable integration requirements has had the effect of increasing the uncertainty of future supply, demand and prices. Academics and practitioners alike have come to understand that probabilistic electricity price (and load) forecasting is now more important for energy systems planning and operations than ever before. With this paper we offer a tutorial review of probabilistic EPF and present much needed guidelines for the rigorous use of methods, measures and tests, in line with the paradigm of 'maximizing sharpness subject to reliability'. The paper can be treated as an update and a further extension of the otherwise comprehensive EPF review of Weron [1] or as a standalone treatment of a fascinating and underdeveloped topic, that has a much broader reach than EPF itself.

This was achieved by coordinated large-scale analyses of single-cell transcriptomes, chromatin accessibility, DNA methylomes, spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes, morphological and electrophysiological properties and cellular resolution input-output mapping, integrated through cross-modal computational analysis. Our results advance the collective knowledge and understanding of brain cell-type organization(1-5). First, our study reveals a unified molecular genetic landscape of cortical cell types that integrates their transcriptome, open chromatin and DNA methylation maps. Second, cross-species analysis achieves a consensus taxonomy of transcriptomic types and their hierarchical organization that is conserved from mouse to marmoset and human. Third, in situ single-cell transcriptomics provides a spatially resolved cell-type atlas of the motor cortex. Fourth, cross-modal analysis provides compelling evidence for the transcriptomic, epigenomic and gene regulatory basis of neuronal phenotypes such as their physiological and anatomical properties, demonstrating the biological validity and genomic underpinning of neuron types. We further present an extensive genetic toolset for targeting glutamatergic neuron types towards linking their molecular and developmental identity to their circuit function. Together, our results establish a unifying and mechanistic framework of neuronal cell-type organization that integrates multi-layered molecular genetic and spatial information with multi-faceted phenotypic properties.

These products are generated from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data. Their unique features include long-term temporal coverage (many from 1981 to the present), high spatial resolutions of the surface radiation products (1 km and 0.05 degrees), spatial continuities without missing pixels, and high quality and accuracy based on extensive validation using in situ measurements and intercomparisons with other existing satellite products. Moreover, the GLASS products are based on robust algorithms that have been published in peer-reviewed literature. Herein, we provide an overview of the algorithm development, product characteristics, and some preliminary applications of these products. We also describe the next steps, such as improving the existing GLASS products, generating more climate data records (CDRs), broadening product dissemination, and fostering their wider utilization. The GLASS products are freely available to the public.

Genomics and epidemiology of the P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Manaus, Brazil	SCIENCE			English	Article							RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME-CORONAVIRUS; RECEPTOR-BINDING DOMAIN; LOCAL TRANSMISSION; MOLECULAR CLOCK; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; COVID-19; SITES	Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Manaus, Brazil, resurged in late 2020 despite previously high levels of infection. Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54 to 79% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.

J.			Large-area mapping of Canadian boreal forest cover, height, biomass and other structural attributes using Landsat composites and lidar plots	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lidar; Landsat; Forest structure; Monitoring; Imputation; Random Forest	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR IMPUTATION; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; TIME-SERIES; AIRBORNE LIDAR; NATIONAL FOREST; DISTURBANCE HISTORY; STAND AGE; TM DATA; INVENTORY; SURFACE	Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the similar to 552 million ha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a > 25,000 km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on > 80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.

However, the effectiveness of different NPIs at reducing transmission is poorly understood. We gathered chronological data on the implementation of NPIs for several European and non-European countries between January and the end of May 2020. We estimated the effectiveness of these NPIs, which range from limiting gathering sizes and closing businesses or educational institutions to stay-at-home orders. To do so, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model that links NPI implementation dates to national case and death counts and supported the results with extensive empirical validation. Closing all educational institutions, limiting gatherings to 10 people or less, and closing face-to-face businesses each reduced transmission considerably. The additional effect of stay-at-home orders was comparatively small.

J	Karlinsky, A; Kobak, D				Karlinsky, Ariel; Kobak, Dmitry			Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic with the World Mortality Dataset	ELIFE			English	Article							HEAT-WAVE; IMPACT; INFLUENZA; ALGORITHM; EPIDEMIC; DEATHS; AUGUST	Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly allcause mortality data from 103 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50% of the expected annual mortality (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) or above 400 excess deaths per 100,000 population (Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia). At the same time, in several other countries (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), by up to two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring.

In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially in the presence of irrelevant covariates.

However, locally semantic change, such as scene composition, relative position between objects, spectral variability caused by illumination, atmospheric effects, and material mixture, has been less frequently investigated in modeling spatial information. Consequently, identifying the same materials from spatially different scenes or positions can be difficult. In this article, we propose a solution to address this issue by locally extracting invariant features from hyperspectral imagery (HSI) in both spatial and frequency domains, using a method called invariant attribute profiles (IAPs). IAPs extract the spatial invariant features by exploiting isotropic filter banks or convolutional kernels on HSI and spatial aggregation techniques (e.g., superpixel segmentation) in the Cartesian coordinate system. Furthermore, they model invariant behaviors (e.g., shift, rotation) by the means of a continuous histogram of oriented gradients constructed in a Fourier polar coordinate. This yields a combinatorial representation of spatial-frequency invariant features with application to HSI classification. Extensive experiments conducted on three promising hyperspectral data sets (Houston2013 and Houston2018) to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed IAP method in comparison with several state-of-the-art profile-related techniques.

Here, the authors estimate the effectiveness of 17 interventions in Europe's second wave, and analyse differences to the first wave as well as implications for the future of the pandemic. European governments use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control resurging waves of COVID-19. However, they only have outdated estimates for how effective individual NPIs were in the first wave. We estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs in Europe's second wave from subnational case and death data by introducing a flexible hierarchical Bayesian transmission model and collecting the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates across Europe. Business closures, educational institution closures, and gathering bans reduced transmission, but reduced it less than they did in the first wave. This difference is likely due to organisational safety measures and individual protective behaviours-such as distancing-which made various areas of public life safer and thereby reduced the effect of closing them. Specifically, we find smaller effects for closing educational institutions, suggesting that stringent safety measures made schools safer compared to the first wave. Second-wave estimates outperform previous estimates at predicting transmission in Europe's third wave.

However, it is computationally challenging to extract single-neuronal activity from microendoscopic data, because of the very large background fluctuations and high spatial overlaps intrinsic to this recording modality. Here, we describe a new constrained matrix factorization approach to accurately separate the background and then demix and denoise the neuronal signals of interest. We compared the proposed method against previous independent components analysis and constrained nonnegative matrix factorization approaches. On both simulated and experimental data recorded from mice, our method substantially improved the quality of extracted cellular signals and detected more well-isolated neural signals, especially in noisy data regimes. These advances can in turn significantly enhance the statistical power of downstream analyses, and ultimately improve scientific conclusions derived from microendoscopic data.

Simultaneously, several other VOCs were identified globally. Unlike B.1.1.7, some of these VOCs possess mutations thought to confer partial immune escape. Understanding when and how these additional VOCs pose a threat in settings where B.1.1.7 is currently dominant is vital. Methods: We examine trends in the prevalence of non-B.1.1.7 lineages in London and other English regions using passive-case detection PCR data, cross-sectional community infection surveys, genomic surveillance, and wastewater monitoring. The study period spans from 31st January 2021 to 15th May 2021. Findings: Across data sources, the percentage of non-B.1.1.7 variants has been increasing since late March 2021. This increase was initially driven by a variety of lineages with immune escape. From mid-April, B.1.617.2 (WHO label Delta) spread rapidly, becoming the dominant variant in England by late May. Interpretation: The outcome of competition between variants depends on a wide range of factors such as intrinsic transmissibility, evasion of prior immunity, demographic specificities and interactions with non pharmaceutical interventions. The presence and rise of non-B.1.1.7 variants in March likely was driven by importations and some community transmission. There was competition between non-B.1.17 variants which resulted in B.1.617.2 becoming dominant in April and May with considerable community transmission. Our results underscore that early detection of new variants requires a diverse array of data sources in community surveillance. Continued real-time information on the highly dynamic composition and trajectory of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages is essential to future control effort s Funding: National Institute for Health Research, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, DeepMind, EPSRC, EA Funds programme, Open Philanthropy, Academy of Medical Sciences Bill,Melinda Gates Foundation, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, The Novo Nordisk Foundation, MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Community Jameel, Cancer Research UK, Imperial College COVID-19 Research Fund, Medical Research Council, Wellcome Sanger Institute.

We characterize static network connectedness using full-sample estimation and dynamic network connectedness using rolling-window estimation. Statically, we find that global bank equity connectedness has a strong geographic component, whereas country sovereign bond connectedness does not. Dynamically, we find that equity connectedness increases during crises, with clear peaks during the Great Financial Crisis and each wave of the subsequent European Debt Crisis, and with movements coming mostly from changes in cross-country as opposed to within-country bank linkages.

Digital media also shape behavior by enabling people to switch between different content easily, and create unique threads of experiences that pass quickly through numerous information categories. Current methods of recording digital experiences provide only partial reconstructions of digital lives that weave - often within seconds - among multiple applications, locations, functions, and media. We describe an end-to-end system for capturing and analyzing the "screenome" of life in media, i.e., the record of individual experiences represented as a sequence of screens that people view and interact with over time. The system includes software that collects screenshots, extracts text and images, and allows searching of a screenshot database. We discuss how the system can be used to elaborate current theories about psychological processing of technology, and suggest new theoretical questions that are enabled by multiple timescale analyses. Capabilities of the system are highlighted with eight research examples that analyze screens from adults who have generated data within the system. We end with a discussion of future uses, limitations, theory, and privacy.

Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives(2). Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7% and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4% and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.

To enable fair comparison between the algorithms for this purpose, we set up the CAMELYON17 challenge in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 Conference in Melbourne. Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted a total of 37 algorithms before the initial deadline. Participants were provided with 899 whole-slide images (WSIs) for developing their algorithms. The developed algorithms were evaluated based on the test set encompassing 100 patients and 500 WSIs. The evaluation metric used was a quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa. We discuss the algorithmic details of the 10 best pre-conference and two post-conference submissions. All these participants used convolutional neural networks in combination with pre- and postprocessing steps. Algorithms differed mostly in neural network architecture, training strategy, and pre- and postprocessing methodology. Overall, the kappa metric ranged from 0.89 to -0.13 across all submissions. The best results were obtained with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet. Confusion matrix analysis revealed that all participants struggled with reliably identifying isolated tumor cells, the smallest type of metastasis, with detection rates below 40%. Qualitative inspection of the results of the top participants showed categories of false positives, such as nerves or contamination, which could be targeted for further optimization. Last, we show that simple combinations of the top algorithms result in higher kappa metric values than any algorithm individually, with 0.93 for the best combination.

Identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 is critical to overcome this pandemic. Metabolites mirror the disease progression of an individual and can provide extensive insights into their pathophysiological significance at each stage of disease. We provide a comprehensive view of metabolic characterisation of sera from COVID-19 patients at all stages using untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis. As compared with the healthy controls, we observed different alteration patterns of circulating metabolites from the mild, severe and recovery stages, in both the discovery cohort and the validation cohort, which suggests that metabolic reprogramming of glucose metabolism and the urea cycle are potential pathological mechanisms for COVID-19 progression. Our findings suggest that targeting glucose metabolism and the urea cycle may be a viable approach to fight COVID-19 at various stages along the disease course.

It is not clear whether liver immune tolerance mechanisms contribute to cancer outcomes. We report that liver metastases diminish immunotherapy efficacy systemically in patients and preclinical models. Patients with liver metastases derive limited benefit from immunotherapy independent of other established biomarkers of response. In multiple mouse models, we show that liver metastases siphon activated CD8(+) T cells from systemic circulation. Within the liver, activated antigen-specific Fas(+)CD8(+) T cells undergo apoptosis following their interaction with FasL(+)CD11b(+)F4/80(+) monocyte-derived macrophages. Consequently, liver metastases create a systemic immune desert in preclinical models. Similarly, patients with liver metastases have reduced peripheral T cell numbers and diminished tumoral T cell diversity and function. In preclinical models, liver-directed radiotherapy eliminates immunosuppressive hepatic macrophages, increases hepatic T cell survival and reduces hepatic siphoning of T cells. Thus, liver metastases co-opt host peripheral tolerance mechanisms to cause acquired immunotherapy resistance through CD8(+) T cell deletion, and the combination of liver-directed radiotherapy and immunotherapy could promote systemic antitumor immunity. Liver metastases reduce clinical and preclinical immune-checkpoint inhibitor efficacy through hepatic siphoning of circulating activated CD8(+) T cells, but therapeutic benefit can be improved by combining immunotherapy with liver-directed radiotherapy.

Anxiety Cells in a Hippocampal-Hypothalamic Circuit	NEURON			English	Article							MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LATERAL ENTORHINAL CORTEX; CA1 AXONAL PROJECTIONS; CALCIUM IMAGING DATA; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS; DENTATE GYRUS; DORSOVENTRAL AXIS; PRIMATE AMYGDALA; GRANULE CELLS; NEURONS	The hippocampus is traditionally thought to transmit contextual information to limbic structures where it acquires valence. Using freely moving calcium imaging and optogenetics, we show that while the dorsal CA1 subregion of the hippocampus is enriched in place cells, ventral CA1 (vCA1) is enriched in anxiety cells that are activated by anxiogenic environments and required for avoidance behavior. Imaging cells defined by their projection target revealed that anxiety cells were enriched in the vCA1 population projecting to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) but not to the basal amygdala (BA). Consistent with this selectivity, optogenetic activation of vCA1 terminals in LHA but not BA increased anxiety and avoidance, while activation of terminals in BA but not LHA impaired contextual fear memory. Thus, the hippocampus encodes not only neutral but also valence-related contextual information, and the vCA1-LHA pathway is a direct route by which the hippocampus can rapidly influence innate anxiety behavior.

In this paper, we describe and compare the codes used to compute photometric redshifts for HSC-SSP, how we calibrate them, and the typical accuracy we achieve with the HSC five-band photometry (grizy). We introduce a new point estimator based on an improved loss function and demonstrate that it works better than other commonly used estimators. We find that our photo-z's are most accurate at 0.2 less than or similar to zp(hot) less than or similar to 1.5, where we can straddle the 4000 angstrom break. We achieve sigma[Delta z(phot)/(1 + z(phot))] similar to 0.05 and an outlier rate of about 15% for galaxies down to i = 25 within this redshift range. If we limit ourselves to a brighter sample of i < 24, we achieve s similar to 0.04 and similar to 8% outliers. Our photo-z's should thus enable many science cases for HSC-SSP. We also characterize the accuracy of our redshift probability distribution function (PDF) and discover that some codes over-/underestimate the redshift uncertainties, which has implications for N(z) reconstruction. Our photo-z products for the entire area in Public Data Release 1 are publicly available, and both our catalog products (such as point estimates) and full PDFs can be retrieved from the data release site, < https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/>.

Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.

Global Burden Dis 2019 Canc Collab	Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years for 29 Cancer Groups From 2010 to 2019 A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019	JAMA ONCOLOGY			English	Article							195 COUNTRIES; HEALTH-CARE; COVID-19; SURVEILLANCE; WORLDWIDE; TERRITORIES; STATISTICS; CHALLENGES; PROGRESS; SUPPORT	IMPORTANCE The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden. OBJECTIVE To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019. EVIDENCE REVIEW The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). FINDINGS In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3%(95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9%(95% UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from 1.4%(1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7%(4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of cancer deaths and YDALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this systematic analysis suggest that the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.

Comprehensive estimates of the global cancer burden in adolescents and young adults (aged 15-39 years) are lacking. To address this gap, we analysed results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, with a focus on the outcome of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), to inform global cancer control measures in adolescents and young adults. Methods Using the GBD 2019 methodology, international mortality data were collected from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, and population-based cancer registry inputs modelled with mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Incidence was computed with mortality estimates and corresponding MIRs. Prevalence estimates were calculated using modelled survival and multiplied by disability weights to obtain years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated as age-specific cancer deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death. The main outcome was DALYs (the sum of YLLs and YLDs). Estimates were presented globally and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles (countries ranked and divided into five equal SDI groups), and all estimates were presented with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). For this analysis, we used the age range of 15-39 years to define adolescents and young adults. Findings There were 1.19 million (95% UI 1.11-1.28) incident cancer cases and 396 000 (370 000-425 000) deaths due to cancer among people aged 15-39 years worldwide in 2019. The highest age-standardised incidence rates occurred in high SDI (59.6 [54.5-65.7] per 100 000 person-years) and high-middle SDI countries (53.2 [48.8-57.9] per 100 000 person-years), while the highest age-standardised mortality rates were in low-middle SDI (14.2 [12.9-15.6] per 100 000 person-years) and middle SDI (13.6 [12.6-14.8] per 100 000 person-years) countries. In 2019, adolescent and young adult cancers contributed 23.5 million (21.9-25.2) DALYs to the global burden of disease, of which 2.7% (1.9-3.6) came from YLDs and 97.3% (96.4-98.1) from YLLs. Cancer was the fourth leading cause of death and tenth leading cause of DALYs in adolescents and young adults globally. Interpretation Adolescent and young adult cancers contributed substantially to the overall adolescent and young adult disease burden globally in 2019. These results provide new insights into the distribution and magnitude of the adolescent and young adult cancer burden around the world. With notable differences observed across SDI settings, these estimates can inform global and country-level cancer control efforts. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.
